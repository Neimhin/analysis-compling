I
welcome
the
delegation

how
many
credit
union
be
on
the
book
of
the
ICB
?
in
term
of
loan
datum
hold
,
Mr.
Ó
Tighearnaigh
refer
to
historical
indicator
and
a
rotate
window
of
24
month
.
what
do
he
mean
by
that
?
in
effect
,
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
be
the
vessel
which
institution
which
be
member
will
go
through
in
term
of
loan
history
and
so
on
.
if
I
understand
Mr.
Ó
Tighearnaigh
correctly
,
there
could
a
person
who
,
for
example
,
hit
a
snag
in
the
last
two
to
three
year
,
which
be
what
be
invariably
happen
,
despite
have
have
a
perfect
credit
history
for
the
previous
ten
or
15
year
,
and
this
be
take
into
account
and
the
ICB
's
system
be
design
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
for
this
eventuality
.
in
other
word
,
a
person
may
have
a
very
good
credit
history
but
then
hit
difficulty
and
the
system
would
take
that
up
on
a
overall
basis
when
assess
the
person
.
what
one
want
to
see
,
if
it
be
put
on
a
statutory
footing
,
be
that
the
system
and
its
underpin
assumption
do
not
militate
against
somebody
who
be
ordinarily
very
compliant
in
term
of
he
or
she
repayment
but
who
may
hit
the
wall
at
some
stage
during
he
or
she
repayment
schedule
.
my
main
fear
concern
that
I
have
refer
to
MABS
or
who
would
have
have
dealing
with
credit
union
.
what
I
have
find
be
that
credit
union
have
act
as
a
type
of
lender
—
I
will
not
call
it
a
lender
of
last
resort
,
but
they
have
cushion
people
who
have
dodgy
credit
history
against
moneylender
,
who
be
largely
unregulated
.
I
have
see
situation
in
which
credit
union
have
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
for
certain
people
with
bad
credit
history
.
what
I
be
anxious
to
find
out
be
whether
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
's
system
will
take
that
into
account
or
see
it
as
a
mitigating
factor
.
I
accept
the
point
.
how
many
moneylending
organisation
,
which
charge
rate
of
up
to
100
%
,
be
on
the
book
of
the
Irish
credit
Bureau
?
what
would
be
the
implication
of
put
all
this
on
a
statutory
footing
?
it
would
obviously
increase
the
bureau
's
operation
significantly
.
what
be
Mr.
Ó
Tighearnaigh
's
view
on
that
?
the
bureau
be
not
a
statutory
body
,
so
Mr.
Ó
Tighearnaigh
can
speak
freely
.
I
thank
Mr.
Ó
Tighearnaigh
and
Mr.
O'Neill

attend
today
's

I
will
be
brief
.
I
welcome
Mr.
Guiomard
and
he
colleague
.
with
regard
to
the
cost
of
€
2.33
per
passenger
on
top
of
the
government
passenger
taxi
,
what
be
Mr.
Guiomard
's
opinion
on
whether
we
be
screw
passenger
to
the
wall
with
regard
to
infrastructure
,
at
a
time
when
we
be
try
to
get
more
people
to
use
Irish
airport
on
either
short
term
or
long
term
visit
?
be
there
scope
for
a
reduction
in
that
figure
even
further
?
in
the
current
climate
by
reduce
that
figure
be
it
the
case
that
financing
be
be
tack
out
for
a
long
period
to
encourage
more
throughput
through
the
airport
?
my
second
question
relate
to
the
traveller
's
protection
fund
.
be
there
a
project
figure
for
2011
?
the
size
of
the
fund
have
decrease
from
€
7.5
million
to
€
5.5
million
.
I
take
it
there
have
be
a
number
of
failure
-
19
failure
accord
to
the
commission
's
submission
.
be
the
commission
project
further
failure
within
that
sector
and
what
contingency
be
in
place
to
account
for
that
possibility
?
I
refer
to
the
potential
merger
of
the
Commission
for
Aviation
Regulation
and
the
National
Transport
Authority
.
what
kind
of
synergy
be
envisage
by
the
commission
in
term
of
its
role
in
that
equation
?
I
presume
if
there
be
synergy
there
will
be
double
up
of
resource
and
personnel
.
what
be
the
projection
as
to
possible
efficiency
in
light
of
such
a
merger
?
will
Mr.
Guiomard
give
detail
of
the
nature
and
outcome
of
the
300
passenger
complaint
?
to
have
some
clarity
on
this
point
,
I
wish
to
ask
another
question
.
I
understand
this
be
the
Commission
for
Aviation
Regulation
.
I
ask
Mr.
Guiomard
to
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
but
in
layman
's
term
I
imagine
that
the
ability
to
maximise
throughput
be
part
of
the
commission
's
remit
.
be
there
scope
for
the
regulator
to
seek
to
influence
government
with
regard
to
the
annual
throughput
of
passenger
through
the
airport
and
how
the
charging
mechanism
affect
that
rate
?
I
take
Mr.
Guiomard
's
point
about
the
charging
mechanism
and
I
make
the
distinction
between
a
government
policy
and
what
be
within
the
remit
of
the
commission
.
however
,
I
would
like
to
see
regulator
express
opinion
as
to
what
need
to
be
do
to
get
more
punter
through
Irish
airport
.
if
Mr.
Guiomard
could
step
outside
the
comfort
zone
and
give
the
committee
a
opinion
,
I
do
not
think
anybody
will
come
down
on
he
like
a
ton
of
brick
.
I
make
that
comment
with
due
regard
to
respect
he
position
.
what
be
the
state
of
play
at
the
moment
?
be
negotiation
ongoing
?
have
there
be
any
discussion
at
ministerial
or
departmental
level
?
the
setting
up
of
a
commission

Regulation
give
the
impression

be

shortcomings

of

perhaps

I
welcome
Ms
Doyle
and
she
colleague
to
the
committee
.
what
be
the
surplus
income
this
year
and
for
what
be
it
be
use
?
be
part
of
the
surplus
income
use
to
produce
the
booklet
present
before
this
committee
today
?
I
receive
a
copy
of
the
proposal
and
the
presentation
by
e-mail
and
do
not
understand
,
therefore
,
give
the
time
we
be
in
,
how
anybody
could
justify
a
spend
on
a
elaborate
,
glossy
presentation
such
as
the
one
we
have
here
.
I
do
not
want
to
sound
'
holy
than
thou
'
about
it
,
but
we
be
all
attuned
to
electronic
media
and
I
find
this
ridiculous
.
Ms
Doyle
state
a
"
equilibrium
"
of
25811
licence
have
be
reach
.
how
do
she
ascertain
we
have
reach
a
equilibrium
level
,
particularly
when
countless
number
of
taxi
driver
say
there
be
over
supply
of
licence
in
the
market
?
she
acknowledge
that
between
2005
and
2008
real
income
reduce
by
5
%
and
say
there
have
be
a
further
reduction
since
2008
.
I
represent
a
constituency
with
a
urban
rural
mix
,
and
give
the
number
of
taxi
driver
who
approach
I
with
query
as
to
how
they
can
obtain
supplementary
welfare
income
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
in
lieu
of
income
they
be
no
long
earn
,
I
suggest
the
reduction
in
income
be
far
more
stark
than
5
%
or
whatever
the
current
figure
be
on
reduction
in
earnings
.
the
key
issue
be
that
taxi
driver
with
a
licence
be
no
long
make
a
living
out
of
they
licence
.
if
I
be
to
speak
for
driver
in
small
town
like
Mallow
,
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
,
I
would
suggest
there
be
a
over
-
supply
of
licence
within
regional
area
outside
of
the
large
metropolitan
area
and
that
the
driver
be
not
able
to
make
a
living
.
perhaps
the
point
be
that
it
be
not
they
divine
right
to
earn
a
living
from
taxi
driving
,
but
if
there
be
some
control
or
great
control
over
the
number
of
licence
issue
full
-
time
driver
who
be
try
to
put
food
on
the
table
might
be
able
to
make
some
kind
of
living
without
have
to
supplement
they
income
with
income
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
what
be
the
delegate
's
view
on
this
?
I
understand
the
Competition
Authority
will
have
a
separate
view
on
licence
number
and
competition
but
I
fail
to
see
how
the
Taxi
Regulator
can
say
we
have
reach
equilibrium
.
I
hope
I
do
not
misunderstand
the
regulator
in
this
regard
.
reference
be
make
to
regulatory
impact
analysis
.
what
be
involved
in
the
regulatory
impact
analysis
of
25,000
licence
in
term
of
the
ability
of
the
driver
to
make
a
living
?
be
the
latter
factor
in
?
the
regulator
state
she
have
carry
out
study
on
real
earnings
.
if
so
,
she
be
consider
sociological
aspect
or
the
economic
cost
of
have
a
over
-
supply
of

Ms
Doyle
state
the
regulatory

be
control
over

the
Taxi

will
continue
to
regulate
the

.
although
there
be
a
dip
in
number
at

,
they
will
probably
increase
in
the
long
term
.
something
will
have
to
give
at
some
stage
.
the
current
number
be
not
sustainable
.
nobody
want
a
close
shop
in
the
taxi
industry
.
while
there
should
be
equilibrium
between
supply
and

,
the

be

to
a
false

the

will
say
anecdotally
one
can
get
a

in
Dublin
at
4
a.m.
on
a
Saturday
and
that
one
might
not
have
be
able
to
do
so
previously
,
but
one
must
ask
how
this
can
be
balance
with
the
over

in

as

Tralee

Killarney

there

this

and
the
next
will
have
to
take
that
into

.
surely
the
regulator
will
have
to
make
a
statement
or
adopt
some
position
on

over

it

we

Professor

refer

the

the

arise
from
this

will
he
give
a
more
unambiguous
view
as
to
how
active
policy
intervention
can
assist
that
ordinary
mortgage
holder
at
risk
of
default
?
while
I
understand
the
point
about
capital
adequacy
ratio
and
the
5
%
write
-
off
provision
,
the
language
use
in
describe
this
problem
should
be
less
abstract
and
provide
some
comfort
for
that
mortgage
holder
pin
to

collar
.
David
McWilliams
and
other
have
posit
the
notion
of
debt
forgiveness
for
mortgage
holder
.
be
that
a
tenable
proposal
?
have
the
Central
Bank
information
on

bad

provision
for

?
be
there
a
oversight
mechanism
in

for
the
various
stage
of

from
a

move
to

-
only

?
a
report
in

state
the

for
how
long

will
it
keep
purchase

?
be
we
wholly

on

now
?
we
be
try
to
get
a
picture
of
how

measure
and
achieve

will
help
get
we
out
of
the
economic
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
it
go
back
to
the
language
use
in
this
discussion
which
be
often
suitably
vague
.
I
will
have
to
go
back
and
read
some
of

to
interpret

Clear

not

also
for
the

somebody
need
to

the
mood

Professor

will
not
take
he
literally
in

with
this
question

the

yes
,
and
we
need
to
drill
down
to

I
appreciate
that

about

approve
the
draft
of
the
order
which
I
will

propose

the
order
seek
to
reserve
32
place
in
the
first
year
of
the
bachelor
of
Education
degree
course
in
the
Church
of

College

,
Rathmine
,
for
student
who
be
member
of
the
Church
of
Ireland
or
belong
to
the
broad
Protestant
tradition
.
the
making
of
the
order
and
its
laying
before
the
House
arise
from
the
provision
of
the
employment
Equality
Act
1998
and
be
design
to
ensure
that
the
rights
and
interest
of
college
and
school
with
a
Protestant
etho
and
the
student
of
that
school
be
provide
for
.
the
employment
Equality
Act
1998
prohibit
discrimination
on
a
wide
-
range
of
grounds
,
include
religion
.
while
the
act
deal
primarily
with
discrimination
in
employment
it
also
extend
to
discrimination
in
vocational
training
.
vocational
training
be
define
as
any
system
of
instruction
that
enable
a
person
to
acquire
the
knowledge
for
the
carry
of
a
occupational
activity
.
teacher
-
training
fall
within
this
definition
.
for
many
year
,
the
Church
of
Ireland
College
of
Education
have
provide
training
in
primary
school
teaching
only
to
student
who
come
from
the
Church
of
Ireland
and
the
broad
Protestant
tradition
.
the
purpose
of
this
practise
be
to
ensure
that
there
be
available
to
school
under
Protestant
ownership
a
sufficient
number
of
teacher
who
themselves
come
from
a
Protestant
background
and
be
train
in
a
institution
with
a
Protestant
etho
.
most
primary
school
in
the
State
be
privately
own
,
publicly
fund
denominational
school
.
this
system
of
denominational
education
be
underpin
by
the
constitution
.
Central
to
the
right
of
the
religious
denomination
to
conduct
school
with
a
particular
etho
be
they
need
to
ensure
that
they
have
available
to
they
a
body
of
staff
belong
to
and
train
in
the
particular
religious
denomination
of
the
school
.
if
such
staff
be
not
available
,
the
constitutional
right
to
free
profession
of
religion
and
the
conduct
of
denominational
school
would
be
seriously
impaired
.
to
avoid
impose
what
would
in
effect
be
unconstitutional
restriction
on
the
rights
of
the
religious
denomination
in
this
regard
section
12
of
the
employment
Equality
Act
1998
,
which
prohibit
discrimination
in
vocational
training
,
make
two
exception
.
it
provide
that
the
prohibition
of
discrimination
do
not
apply
for
the
purpose
of
ensure
the
availability
of
nurse
and
teacher
to
denominational
hospital
and
primary
school
respectively
.
in
the
case
of
primary
school
the
section
provide
that
a
educational
or
training
body
may
apply
to
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
for
a
order
permit
the
body
to
reserve
place
on
the
vocational
training
course
.
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
with
the
consent
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
,
Equality
and
Defence
,
may
then
make
a
order
allow
the
body
to
reserve
such
number
of
place
to
meet
the
need
for
teacher
in
primary
school
as
be
consider
appropriate
.
the
Church
of
Ireland
College
of
Education
have
make
a
application
on
behalf
of
the
college
for
the
reservation
of
32
place
in
the
college
for
the
academic
year
2013
-
14
up
to
2017
-
18
for
student
who
be
member
of
recognise
church
in
the
Protestant
tradition
.
the
college
make
the
case
that
the
reservation
of
32
place
,
which
be
currently
the
full
complement
of
first
year
place
in
the
college
,
should
be
make
in
order
to
provide
sufficient
teacher
for
Protestant
school
over
the
next
number
of
year
.
the
grounds
for
the
request
as
put
by
the
college
be
as
follow
:
the
necessity
of
provide
a
sufficient
number
of
qualified
primary
teacher
to
maintain
the
distinctive
etho
of
Protestant
school
remain
the
central
concern
and
motivation
for
seek
the
order
;
primary
school
in
the
Protestant
community
depend
almost
exclusively
on
the
college
for
the
provision
of
a
annual
supply
of
well
qualified
teacher
from
a
Protestant
background
;
a
report
continue
shortage
of
applicant
for
teaching
position
in
Protestant
primary
school
,
particularly
small
school
in
rural
area
;
some
of
that
who
enter
the
college
will
not
complete
they
study
and
of
that
who
qualify
some
will
not
take
up
post
in
school
with
the
Protestant
etho
;
also
,
a
number
of
graduate
go
to
live
and
work
abroad
while
other
engage
in
further
study
.
I
believe
,
in
the
circumstance
set
out
by
the
college
,
the
continue
reservation
of
32
place
in
the
college
for
student
from
the
Protestant
tradition
appear
reasonable
to
ensure
that
Protestant
school
have
available
to
they
a
sufficient
number
of
teacher
who
share
they
value
system
and
religious
belief
.
apart
from
the
constitutional
requirement
from
which
this
order
flow
,
the
order
be
a
necessary
support
for
the
maintenance
of
diversity
of
value
,
belief
and
culture
in
we
education
system
and
Irish
society
.
give
that
school
with
a
Protestant
etho
represent
only
a
small
minority
of
primary
school
in
the
State
,
there
be
clearly
a
risk
that
that
etho
could
be
dilute
unless
specific
protection
be
provide
.
this
order
put
in
place
a
protection
which
the
Oireachtas
consider
appropriate
and
which
will
guarantee
Protestant
school
that
they
can
continue
to
provide
education
for
they
student
in
accordance
with
they
particular
value
and
belief
.
I
acknowledge
that
some
aspect
of
the
environment
in
which
the
Church
of
Ireland
College
of
Education
operate
be
change
.
I
refer
in
this
regard
specifically
to
development
in
relation
to
school
patronage
and
the
work
underway
on
the
restructuring
of
teacher
education
provision
in
Ireland
.
however
,
there
be
a
continue
need
for
this
provision
to
be
make
.
the
primary
legislation
govern
the
order
provide
that
it
may
be
revoke
and
any
effect
of
this
development
on
the
necessity
for
the
order
will
be
keep
under
review
.
I
thank
the
committee
for
its
consideration
of
this
important
issue
,
which
safeguard
and
support
the
maintenance
of
diversity
of
value
,
belief
and
culture
in
we
education
system
and
Irish
society
.
deputy
McConalogue
's
first
question
be
about
place
and
all
32
place
have
be
take
and
it
have
happen
three
time
.
I
do
not
really
understand
the
third
question
and
perhaps
I
misheard
it
.
there
be
a
philosophical
element
in
this
,
I
suppose
,
and
if
I
be
read
the
intervention
by
Deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
,
Collins
and
Bannon
correctly
,
there
seem
to
be
a
issue
with
whether
the
State
should
provide
wholly
for
education
of
primary
and
post
-
primary
level
,
or
if
there
should
be
what
could
loosely
be
call
a
subvention
for
provision
at
school
where
there
be
a
particular
religious
etho
.
we
be
all
aware
of
the
particular
provision
propose
here
,
which
be
to
ensure
we
can
guarantee
the
teaching
etho
through
the
Protestant
tradition
.
we
would
not
necessarily
disagree
with
that
.
speak
personally
,
one
could
argue
that
religious
formation
for
any
citizen
could
take
place
through
a
Sunday
school
mechanism
or
outside
normal
teaching
hour
.
nevertheless
,
the
State
provide
for
a
number
of
hour
,
which
be
probably
a
vagary
of
we
history
of
a
strong
Catholic
etho
with
other
minority
religion
.
the
education
sector
in
Finland
have
97
%
of
school
within
the
state
sector
and
religious
formation
be
extraneous
to
the
process
.
the
majority
of
the
school
be
within
the
public
sphere
.
Ireland
be
a
particular
country
with
a
specific
history
and
tradition
,
so
there
be
a
historical
narrative
in
that
regard
.
it
be
a
question
of
where
we
be
move
.
be
we
look
to
divest
ourselves
of
any
state
intervention
with
school
of
a
particular
etho
?
that
be
a
particular
philosophical
question
with
which
we
must
grapple
.
I
have
a
particular
policy
responsibility
for
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
math
,
and
if
member
be
ask
I
whether
I
believe
we
should
spend
more
time
in
school
teach
in
that
area
than
prepare
for
certain
aspect
of
religious
formation
,
I
know
I
would
prefer
to
invest
the
time
in
teach
core
subject
.
that
be
a
personal
opinion
.
I
sense
from
the
committee
that
there
be
no
difficulty
with
the
provision
be
propose
.
in
response
to
deputy
Bannon
,
there
be
no
different
set
of
rights
.
we
be
recognise
a
minority
etho
and
ensure
it
be
protect
in
term
of
pedagogy
,
teaching
and
ensure
the
supply
of
teacher
,
and
we
be
do
it
in
a
structure
way
.
there
be
a
continue
need
and
not
all
32
graduate
necessarily
end
up
within
the
Protestant
sector
.
some
will
go
to
Educate
together
school
and
some
have
even
go
to
Roman
Catholic
school
.
it
be
about
ensure
the
need
be
meet
on
a
continue
basis
.
that
be
the
fundamental
aspect
of
this
.
the
restructuring
of
teacher
education
college
throw
up
vagary
.
for
example
,
with
regard
to
the
DCU
etho
,
if
one
be
map
-----
there
be
nothing
in
that
which
preclude
anybody
of
a
particular
etho
-----
exactly
.
absolutely
.
fundamentally
,
we
objective
be
to
ensure
that
every
etho
be
provide
for
specifically
.
that
be
the
fundamental
tenet
of
this
provision
.
in
any
restructuring
of
teacher
training
college
,
for
example
,
no
single
entity
or
etho
be
exclude
.
I
believe
that
be
the
point
the
Senator
be
make
.
yes
.
historically
,
teacher
training
be
very
much
align
to
particular
tradition
,
even
within
the
Catholic
etho
.
there
be
vary
tradition
in
distinct
geographical
location
.
personally
,
I
believe
we
must
move
to
a
teacher
training
paradigm
that
be
more
reflective
of
Irish
society
and
more
pluralist
in
its
approach
,
while
ensure
there
be
inherent
guarantee
for
a
minority
etho
that
probably
need
a
certain
protection
.
this
be
evolve
.
as
Irish
society
evolve
,
the
restructuring
of
teacher
training
evolve
.
even
the
debate
about
patronage
be
evolve
.
there
have
never
really
be
a
big
debate
in
Ireland
about
patronage
.
it
be
about
parent
look
at
they
own
religious
belief
and
where
they
want
they
child
to
go
in
term
of
religious
formation
-----
-----
and
have
choice
.
I
hope
I
answer
all
of
the
question
.
I
apologise
if
I
have
not
.

that

not

a

on
this

in

Quinn
Insurance
Limited
arrive
in
a
insurance
market
inhabit
by
a
old
boy
's
network
.
Quinn
Insurance
Limited
open
up
the
sector
and
that
be
to
be
welcome
.
what
come
across
in
the
submission
be
that
the
Quinn
Group
be
hungry
for
new
business
and
this
mean
new
job
in
the
region
we
be
talk
about
.
I
represent
Cork
East
,
in
which
Fermoy
be
locate
.
I
visit
the
branch
in
the
Eastgate
Business
and
retail
Park
in
Cork
.
Quinn
Group
employee
have
massive
loyalty
to
the
group
and
have
a
coterie
of
loyal
employee
mean
people
want
to
strive
for
new
business
.
I
realise
the
constraint
on
we
because
of
the
difficulty
in
make
a
direct
political
intervention
as
a
result
of
the
new
culture
with
regard
to
the
regulatory
framework
.
however
,
facilitate
the
Quinn
Group
make
its
case
mean
that
the
regulator
be
listen
.
I
have
a
particular
interest
in
Quinn
Healthcare
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
sense
of
the
permutation
of
today
's
announcement
and
what
this
mean
within
other
business
in
the
Quinn
Group
.
Quinn
Healthcare
be
a
highly
profitable
business
and
have
slaughter
many
sacred
cow
in
term
of
the
old
boy
's
network
that
exist
within
that
business
.
it
continue
to
have
to
pay
€
39
million
per
year
to
keep
another
company
afloat
.
will
today
's
announcement
have
a
impact
on
other
business
in
the
Quinn
Group
?
it
would
be
a
shame
if
the
current
system
have
a
negative
impact
on
other
business
.
that
would
be
unnecessary
and
be
preventable
.

the

for
its
attendance

that
would
be
great
.

my
question
relate
to
the
sugar
industry
.
I
hail
from
the
town
of
Mallow
.
when
the
court
's
report
be
issue
,
it
be
meet
with
utter
devastation
,
disgust
and
complete
surprise
,
even
in
view
of
what
other
member
have
state
here
today
.
the
report
,
which
be
comprehensive
,
state
"
the
audit
find
that
in
one
ms
[
member
state
]
the
only
producer
,
which
before
the
sugar
reform
have
undertake
a
consolidation
/
rationalisation
of
its
processing
facility
and
define
itself
as
one
of
Europe
's
most
efficient
producer
,
close
down
its
large
,
modern
and
potentially
efficient
sugar
factory
justify
they
decision
on
the
risk
of
the
low
price
reduce
the
supply
of
sugar
beet
to
a
uneconomic
level
"
.
I
be
unsure
whether
the
follow
quote
come
from
Mr.
O'Shea
but
as
per
the
RTE
news
on
the
day
of
the
publication
of
the
report
,
a
quote
attribute
to
Mr.
O'Shea
state
that
it
be
possible
the
Greencore
plant
would
still
be
operate
today
if
it
be
not
for
the
sugar
reform
introduce
by
the
European
Commission
.
I
seek
a
confirmation
of
what
have
be
state
already
in
the
report
.
do
this
so
-
call
reform
of
the
sugar
industry
meet
its
target
?
if
it
do
not
meet
its
target
be
there
a
possibility
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
we
be
not
to
produce
sugar
in
this
country
until
2017
,
that
it
can
be
revisit
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
European
Court
of
Auditor
's
report
clearly
state
that
the
regime
do
not
set
out
to
do
what
it
be
suppose
to
do
.
the
use
of
the
word
"
reform
"
be
thorny
because
it
be
a
load
term
as
well
.
it
be
not
a
reform
and
clearly
it
do
not
work
.
the
grower
and
the
worker
who
lose
they
job
wish
to
know
where
now
for
the
report
?
what
be
the
import
of
it
?
will
it
work
its
way
into
the
ether
?
be
we
leave
with
the
political
entrail
of
it
?
be
there
hope
that
we
could
glean
from
the
report
the
potential
to
rekindle
the
industry
?
I
to
refer
to
the
summary
in
the
report
.
point
ii
state
the
objective
of
the
reform
be
"
to
ensure
the
competitiveness
of
the
EU
sugar
industry
"
.
that
have
not
be
achieve
because
we
now
have
a
cartel
and
75
factory
have
close
with
20000
job
lose
throughout
the
European
Union
.
will
the
delegation
inform
the
committee
how
many
we
be
leave
with
?
I
believe
there
be
only
a
handful
operate
within
France
,
Germany
and
perhaps
other
country
.
the
French
and
German
have
now
create
a
cartel
in
the
production
of
sugar
in
the
European
Union
.
a
layman
's
view
be
that
if
the
European
Court
of
Auditor
's
report
be
to
mean
anything
there
should
be
a
reversal
of
this
trend
and
peripheral
country
such
as
Ireland
should
be
able
to
get
back
into
the
market
not
only
for
sugar
production
for
confectionary
or
other
purpose
but
also
for
the
production
of
ethanol
to
meet
we
bio
-
fuel
obligation
under
EU
legislation
.
I
would
like
to
get
the
opinion
of
the
witness
on
the
matter
and
I
apologise
if
my
question
be
not
strictly
relevant
to
the
business
before
we
.
Mr.
O'Shea
state
the
purpose
of
the
court
of
Auditor
be
to
set
down
a
marker
now
on
what
to
do
or
what
not
to
do
in
the
future
.
there
be
a
tacit
expression
in
the
report
that
the
commission
-
I
do
not
want
to
speak
in
the
vernacular
-
make
a
complete
hame
of
this
and
that
we
decimate
a
industry
overnight
.
we
be
now
be
tell
not
to
do
it
again
and
that
this
be
not
the
way
to
do
business
.
do
not
get
I
wrong
;
I
be
not
have
a
go
at
the
witness
and
I
understand
from
where
they
be
come
on
this
.
however
,
when
global
sugar
price
be
increase
and
we
can
produce
the
product
here
it
do
not
seem
good
enough
to
tell
the
citizen
of
this
country
that
mistake
be
make
but
to
drive
on
and
this
be
what
not
to
do
in
the
future
.
it
be
not
good
enough
.
particularly
for
somebody
in
my
party
,
which
be
overtly
pro-European
and
outward
look
,
it
feed
into
a
cynicism
as
to
how
the
commission
work
,
particularly
on
how
certain
government
can
control
certain
aspect
of
the
regime
while
profess
to
be
move
into
a
intra-institutional
framework
in
term
of
decision
-
making
.
it
be
still
very
much
a
intergovernmental
framework
and
very
much
about
the
interest
of
the
nation
state
.
this
clearly
prove
that
the
interest
of
France
and
Germany
be
tie
up
in
ensure
that
Irish
sugar
could
no
long
exist
.
the
court
of
Auditor
be
now
vindicate
this
position
in
its
report
but
there
be
not
a
bless
thing
we
can
do
about
it
.
this
be
not
good
enough
.
I
be
not
try
to
shoot
the
messenger
but
if
the
power
of
this
Parliament
have
be
increase
under
the
Lisbon
treaty
there
must
be
something
we
be
able
to
do
to
change
this
type
of
decision
-
making
because
it
be
completely
inadequate
.
not
for
ethanol
.
be
it
true
that
for
€
20
million
less
we
could
have
keep
the
factory
open
in
Mallow
?
we
get
€
20
million
to
raze
it
to
the
ground
.
if
that
have
be
foregone
,
the
factory
could
have
remain
stand
and
we
could
have
move
into
ethanol
production
.
the
opinion
that
the
factory
be
destroy
for
the
sake
of
a
€
20
million
compensation
package
have
be
do
the
round
locally
for
some
year
.
this
be
important
.
how
do
the
auditor
adjudicate
that
the
information
receive
be
incorrect
?
do
they
do
that
through
they
own
source
or
be
that
knowledge
impart
to
they
by
a
third
party
or
another
source
after
the
fact
?
the
policy
be
implement
and
do
what
it
set
out
to
do
.
the
auditor
be
now
say
the
information
be
flawed
.
at
what
point
do
the
auditor
adjudicate
the
information
be
flawed
?
from
what
source
do
they
get
that
information
?
do
it
come
from
a
member
state
or
the
commission
?
I
presume
the
commission
be
act
on
information
supply
by
the
member
state
.
that
be
what
we
be
try
to
establish
.
as
far
as
we
be
concerned
,
that
be
the
kernel
of
the
issue
.
we
be
at
a
crucial
stage
of
this
interaction
.
could
I
ask
that
Mr.
O'Shea
be
give
a
chance
to
respond
?
the
delegation
be
base
this
on
commission
information
,
datum
or
statistic
.
that
be
a
racing
certainty
.
however
,
what
commission
datum
be
use
?
where
do
the
commission
ascertain
its
datum
on
grow
,
number
and
funding
?
it
have
to
do
this
through
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
in
this
country
,
directly
from
farm
source
or
other
source
.
or
from
Greencore
.
there
must
have
be
a
information
flow
between
the
agricultural
or
beet
grow
sector
here
and
the
commission
for
the
court
to
adjudicate
on
the
commission
datum
.
with
respect
,
Mr.
O'Shea
be
kick
to
touch
on
this
one
.
at
issue
be
transparency
in
the
European
Union
.
at
the
outset
of
the
report
I
take
the
view
Mr.
O'Shea
be
a
man
who
have
just
author
a
report
which
clearly
show
inadequacy
in
how
the
regime
work
and
the
court
's
report
be
remarkably
tacit
.
let
we
start
drill
down
.
I
note
the
gentleman
beside
Mr.
O'Shea
,
who
have
not
make
any
contribution
,
whisper
something
into
he
ear
.
we
wish
to
establish
the
situation
.
from
which
source
do
the
court
get
the-----
this
be
suppose
to
be
a
transparent
process
.
if
one
author
a
report-----
we
respect
that
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
Chairman
-----
chairman-----
this
be
a
committee
.
on
a
point
of
order
-----
I
appreciate
the
Chairman
's
latitude
on
this
matter
.
I
be
not
try
to
have
a
go
at
Mr.
O'Shea
or
Mr.
Weldon
.
we
be
simply
try
to
ascertain
something
.
I
be
not
a
accountant
or
a
auditor
.
however
,

question

the
committee
and
by
member
in

will
be
answer

I
be
sorry
.
we
must
bring
the
debate
to
a
conclusion
.
I
thank
the
delegate
for
appear
before
the
committee
at
short
notice
originally
on
the
annual
report
,
and
not
specifically
on
the
sugar
item
.
I
encourage
the
secretariat
to
encourage
the
delegation
to
speak
a
little
on
this
subject
because
it
be
of
fundamental
importance
and
have
considerable
consequence
for
the
country
in
general
and
confidence
in
the
system
and
system
and
the
way
they
work
.
the
committee
will
endeavour
to
follow
up
the
various
point
raise
by
the
delegate
.
we
have
facility
available
to
we
to
enable
we
to
do
that
.
we
will
make
the
necessary
inquiry
and
ensure
that
the
question
raise
by
member
of
the
committee
and
by
member
in
attendance
will
be
answer
.
I
welcome
the
visit
of
Mr.
Verhofstadt
.
his
engagement
with
the
people
of
Northern
Ireland
,
particularly
that
in
the
Border
region
,
and
he
comment
on
enable
Northern
Ireland
to
retain
access
to
the
single
market
and
custom
union
be
warmly
welcome
.
I
concur
with
my
fellow
speaker
who
have
say
that
by
any
objective
analysis
,
as
co-ordinator
Mr.
Verhofstadt
have
display
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
dynamic
at
play
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
he
be
right
when
he
say
that
responsibility
for
find
a
solution
to
the
Irish
Border
question
lie
with
the
UK
and
no
realistic
proposal
have
yet
emerge
from
that
quarter
.
my
first
question
be
very
simple
.
will
Mr.
Verhofstadt
and
he
colleague
,
Mr.
Brok
and
Mr.
Gualtieri
,
consider
include
within
the
wording
of
any
final
European
Parliament
resolution
a
clause
that
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
be
maintain
and
the
principle
of
parity
of
esteem
and
human
rights
protection
be
upheld
,
especially
give
that
56
%
of
the
population
in
Northern
Ireland
vote
to
remain
within
the
EU
?
if
no
such
protection
be
forthcoming
from
the
UK
,
will
the
European
Parliament
veto
any
outcome
that
do
not
satisfy
that
fundamental
rights
?
my
second
question
relate
to
a
very
good
article
by
Mr.
Verhofstadt
that
be
publish
in
the
Observer
on
9
July
last
,
in
which
he
write
very
rationally
about
the
UK
position
on
citizen
's
rights
.
he
refer
particularly
to
third
country
national
,
the
new
status
that
will
pertain
in
the
UK
,
the
need
for
separate
application
for
settle
status
and
the
five
-
year
residence
requirement
.
this
be
another
simple
question
.
how
seriously
be
the
European
Parliament
take
the
UK
's
negotiating
position
,
which
be
grossly
insulting
to
any
Irish
person
live
in
the
UK
who
have
settle
there
for
year
and
have
a
intergenerational
relationship
and
which
will
set
back
the
cause
of
Anglo
-
Irish
relation
by
year
?
I
would
like
to
know
Mr.
Verhofstadt
's
opinion
on
that
.
thank
you
very
much
,
a
Chathaoirligh
.
while
I
have
no
particular
preference
on
this
matter
and
will
be
guide
by
the
chairman
,
would
it
be
appropriate
perhaps
to
wait
until
more
member
be
present
to
make
a
determination
on
that
?
it
be
just
a
suggestion
and
as
I
have
state
,
I
will
be
guide
by
-----
that
watch
the
proceedings
of
the
committee
be
look
for
some
comfort
that
the
government
be
intervene
in
a
manner
that
will
seek
to
reduce
the
cost
of
motor
insurance
premium
and
other
premium
as
well
.
for
the
purpose
of
today
we
be
talk
about
motor
insurance
premium
.
I
be
a
little
bit
worried
by
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
if
I
interpret
he
intervention
correctly
,
he
be
tell
we
that
"
the
ability
of
the
government
to
influence
insurance
pricing
be
limited
,
as
insurance
company
be
require
by
European
law
to
price
in
accordance
with
risk
"
.
if
a
person
receive
a
letter
from
the
insurance
company
say
that
the
premium
have
increase
by
30
%
or
50
%
or
whatever
and
that
person
be
drive
for
quite
a
number
of
year
with
a
clean
record
,
he
or
she
would
be
shocked
at
have
to
pay
upwards
of
50
%
of
a
increase
in
he
or
she
insurance
premium
because
there
be
not
such
a
increase
risk
overnight
.
one
have
to
conclude
from
the
point
of
view
of
ordinary
motorist
that
the
provisioning
arrangement
by
insurance
company
be
too
low
,
that
there
be
the
lack
of
transparency
and
that
perhaps
the
insurance
house
,
most
of
which
be
global
corporate
,
be
readjust
the
price
setting
for
the
Irish
market
in
order
that
they
can
engage
in
super
-
normal
profit
share
.
what
we
really
need
to
hear
in
this
committee
be
whether
the
government
have
the
power
to
legislate
effectively
to
compel
the
insurance
company
to
meet
they
obligation
to
ensure
that
people
pay
a
fair
premium
for
a
fair
risk
on
they
driving
.
I
be
worried
about
the
Minister
of
State
's
intervention
and
that
the
working
group
be
predominantly
constitute
by
Department
of
State
,
which
be
fair
enough
and
be
appropriate
.
there
be
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
,
the
Department
of
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
the
Central
Bank
of
Ireland
and
the
injury
Board
.
I
have
not
hear
from
the
Minister
of
State
what
the
level
of
engagement
have
be
so
far
with
the
insurance
company
base
in
Ireland
and
that
underwrite
that
risk
,
be
they
operate
in
the
Irish
market
or
externally
.
I
have
a
funny
feeling
that
they
be
readjust
they
business
model
to
extract
a
lot
more
profit
from
the
Irish
market
overnight
with
a
short
sharp
shock
.
that
be
what
many
people
be
experience
this
year
with
the
massive
increase
in
they
premium
.
if
the
purpose
of
the
insurance
company
be
,
under
European
law
,
to
price
in
accordance
with
risk
,
it
have
to
be
say
,
with
some
degree
of
fairness
and
balance
,
that
the
behaviour
of
most
driver
have
not
change
and
they
be
still
drive
competently
,
so
why
should
they
pay
extra
for
they
premium
?
can
the
minister
of
State
give
a
clear
idea
of
whether
we
can
legislate
to
change
the
behaviour
in
the
insurance
sector
?
that
be
a
simple
yes
or
no
question
.
it
be
incumbent
on
we
to
be
very
clear
with
motorist
experience
this
difficulty
.
be
there
a
proper
level
of
co-operation
with
the
insurance
company
,
if
they
have
be
engage
in
this
process
,
and
the
working
group
?
if
they
want
to
,
they
could
ignore
this
process
and
continue
to
do
whatever
it
be
they
want
to
do
.
if
they
do
not
buy
into
this
process
we
could
argue
that
we
be
at
nothing
here
.
there
could
be
some
legislation
around
what
the
injury
Board
do
,
or
transparency
in
respect
of
settle
claim
.
can
we
legislate
to
ensure
there
be
transparency
around
settle
claim
out
of
court
,
through
the
PIAB
,
and
within
the
court
?
we
need
much
more
transparency
and
we
must
be
clear
with
motorist
about
whether
we
can
legislate
to
reduce
premium
.
we
also
need
to
have
some
degree
of
compellability
in
respect
of
how
the
insurance
industry
engage
with
the
working
group
and
politically
,
to
give
motorist
some
comfort
about
reduce
the
cost
of
premium
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
as
far
as
the
public
be
concerned
,
I
have
meet
many
people
who
battle
with
they
insurance
company
about
increase
premium
and
succeed
in
have
they
reduce
.
the
public
have
a
role
in
this
too
.
person
should
not
take
increase
in
they
premium
at
face
value
.
they
should
engage
with
they
insurance
company
and
seek
reduction
,
thus
bring
attention
to
this
issue
,
which
be
critical
to
all
of
we
life
,
as
we
want
to
be
insure
.

I
thank
the
witness
for
come
in
.
they
submission
have
be
very
informative
.
I
have
a
few
interactive
question
.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
,
be
before
the
committee
yesterday
and
I
be
sure
the
witness
have
read
some
of
the
transcript
.
he
say
"
the
ability
of
the
government
to
influence
insurance
pricing
be
limited
,
as
insurance
company
be
require
by
European
law
to
price
in
accordance
with
risk
"
.
it
be
worth
we
while
interrogate
further
the
setting
of
the
discount
rate
.
the
rate
may
be
2
%
or
3
%
but
the
insurance
premium
have
increase
by
multiple
of
that
.
I
assume
that
be
because
of
provisioning
.
it
would
be
useful
for
people
watch
online
if
Mr.
Faughnan
could
give
they
a
good
appreciation
as
to
why
there
have
be
a
loading
on
insurance
premium
this
year
.
I
be
fascinate
by
the
fact
that
he
say
insurance
company
be
narrow
they
footprint
and
cherry
-
pick
customer
.
Mr.
Moran
have
say
that
there
have
be
no
increase
in
the
risk
related
to
old
driver
but
they
be
be
tell
when
the
go
to
renew
they
premium
that
they
carry
a
great
risk
.
I
imagine
the
market
be
still
lucrative
so
I
do
not
see
why
they
be
narrow
they
footprint
.
I
imagine
the
risk
be
still
cover
to
a
large
extent
.
be
it
because
the
underwriter
,
of
which
globally
there
be
a
limited
number
work
in
the
motor
insurance
sector
,
be
decide
the
Irish
market
be
not
lucrative
enough
?
be
they
say
that
profit
be
the
ultimate
motive
over
and
above
that
of
risk
?
I
would
like
a
deep
understanding
of
why
the
witness
feel
there
will
be
a
further
rise
of
20
%
over
the
next
two
or
three
quarter
.
be
the
witness
interact
with
the
Minister
of
State
's
working
group
?
I
get
a
sense
from
the
Minister
of
State
's
intervention
yesterday
that
while
there
have
be
meeting
,
the
insurance
industry
be
not
really
a
stakeholder
in
the
process
but
merely
a
contributor
.
the
firm
give
information
but
be
not
influence
a
potential
outcome
which
would
see
the
necessary
reduction
in
premium
,
as
call
for
by
Mr.
Griffin
,
especially
in
the
case
of
young
driver
and
old
driver
.
we
all
have
experience
of
this
issue
from
we
work
in
we
constituency
,
whether
they
be
rural
or
urban
.
as
public
representative
,
we
have
see
a
massive
increase
in
the
cost
of
premium
.
when
we
see
increase
of
between
33
%
and
50
%
in
the
cost
of
premium
,
we
wonder
if
it
be
base
on
the
profit
motive
or
something
else
.
be
it
only
about
the
book
of
quantum
or
the
automatic
number
plate
recognition
,
anpr
,
or
the
discount
rate
?
it
seem
to
I
there
be
something
more
to
it
than
that
.
be
there
another
explanation
of
the
discount
rate
?
there
be
-----
there
be
a
legislative
provision
to
do
that
.
in
other
word
,
we
in
the
Oireachtas
could
influence
that
.
if
Mr.
Faughnan
be
say
that
historically
premium
be
reduce
to
a
critical
point
where
they
be
not
able
to
cover
the
cost
-----
-----
what
be
the
natural
correction
?
be
there
a
assessment
of
a
figure
of
a
natural
correction
because
the
assumption
here
be
that
we
will
accept
a
correction
-----
-----
but
it
seem
there
be
a
loading
on
that
correction
which
be
now
move
it
into
the
supernormal
profit
,
if
I
can
incorrectly
use
that
term
.
in
other
word
,
if
somebody
have
pay
a
premium
of
€500
,
for
example
,
and
this
year
it
be
€
800
,
of
the
€300
extra
,
what
be
the
correction
and
what
be
absolute
supernormal
profit
?
that
be
why
if
one
speak
to
Mr.
Kian
Griffin
's
constituency
and
to
old
people
they
be
absolutely
perplexed
.
we
be
all
perplexed
as
to
why
we
be
pay
so
much
extra
for
we
premium
overnight
.
it
seem
to
I
that
not
all
the
factor
that
Mr.
Faughnan
talk
about
here
be
contribute
factor
but
that
there
be
a
profit
load
on
that
as
well
.
for
instance
,
aa
have
three
underwriter
.
obviously
,
it
be
in
a
pretty
secure
position
because
it
have
three
underwriter
.
perhaps
that
be
the
norm
;
I
do
not
know
.
it
seem
to
I
that
the
underwriter
,
which
be
big
international
house
,
be
influence
the
market
in
little
Ireland
because
it
be
a
small
market
in
global
term
.
we
should
interrogate
that
further
because
I
think
Mr.
Faughnan
be
say
that
there
be
hope
in
term
of
some
legislative
change
and
datum
share
,
which
be
the
European
norm
.
if
we
can
get
that
thing
right
within
this
committee
and
within
the
house
,
we
will
go
some
way
to
ameliorate
the
situation
but
the
profit
element
be
something
we
need
transparency
on
.
that
be
why
the
working
group
,
with
political
support
on
a
cross-party
basis
and
work
proactively
with
all
of
the
stakeholder
,
have
the
potential
to
get
to
the
nub
of
this
problem
.

I
too
thank
the
delegation
for
attend
the
committee
today
.
the
point
they
have
make
have
be
raise
previously
by
other
who
have
interven
.
there
be
a
common
purpose
there
which
be
distil
down
into
a
number
of
issue
,
namely
,
about
access
to
proper
datum
and
ensure
a
upgrading
of
the
book
of
quantum
.
a
additional
point
be
make
today
by
the
Irish
Road
Haulage
Association
,
IRHA
,
and
Ms
Verona
Murphy
on
access
to
the
single
Market
.
I
understand
the
cabotage
issue
and
flag
in
another
country
.
do
the
IRHA
have
a
assessment
as
to
where
the
political
fault
line
be
in
open
up
the
insurance
market
for
haulier
?
up
to
90
%
of
we
export
goods
be
move
by
road
which
mean
haulier
be
absolutely
vital
to
the
economy
.
we
introduce
a
set
of
measure
to
reduce
the
motor
tax
element
in
budget
2016
.
it
seem
now
,
however
,
that
have
be
wipe
out
because
of
increase
insurance
cost
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
idea
as
to
how
Irish
haulier
be
interface
with
European
haulier
in
open
up
the
market
.
for
instance
,
Aviva
be
a
international
insurance
house
.
if
it
can
operate
in
the
Irish
market
and
other
member
state
,
I
can
not
see
why
there
cannot
be
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
across
boundary
,
particularly
as
we
have
a
single
market
and
free
movement
of
goods
and
service
.
what
do
the
IRHA
perceive
to
be
the
blockage
to
that
?
the
minister
have
set
up
the
cost
of
insurance
working
group
.
have
he
invite
the
IRHA
to
discuss
this
issue
which
we
be
deal
with
today
?
if
so
,
have
this
point
be
make
to
he
and
the
working
group
?
I
do
not
want
to
give
Ms
Murphy
platitude
.
I
think
we
all
appreciate
the
attendant
cost
that
be
be
load
on
to
the
sector
.
we
purpose
here
be
to
try
to
drill
down
.
my
understanding
be
that
there
be
a
single
European
market
for
insurance
.
I
want
to
get
to
the
nub
of
the
interaction
between
the
witness
and
the
working
group
.
it
appear
that
there
have
be
no
engagement
so
this
committee
could
recommend
that
the
people
who
have
make
presentation
here
today
in
respect
of
very
specific
point
could
carry
forward
and
interact
with
the
working
group
because
this
be
vital
.
in
respect
of
the
guideline
on
injury
,
I
know
we
will
use
the
big
toe
and
little
toe
analogy
.
the
injury
Board
be
basically
tell
we
that
the
average
pay
-
out
on
claim
between
2009
and
2015
be
approximately
€
22000
or
€
23000
.
Mr.
Redmond
and
Mr.
McDonnell
have
touch
on
this
issue
.
we
have
to
find
a
solution
somewhere
.
notwithstanding
the
Supreme
Court
decision
where
there
be
the
right
to
legal
representation
,
and
one
take
that
for
what
it
be
,
it
seem
that
if
it
have
deal
with
100000
award
since
2005
and
the
average
pay
-
out
be
approximately
€
22000
or
€
23000
,
it
appear
that
there
be
a
multiple
of
that
,
which
be
not
quantifiable
at
this
point
in
time
,
where
claim
be
pay
out
on
the
step
of
the
court
.
this
be
where
the
datum
and
lack
of
transparency
come
in
.
this
be
where
we
will
be
engage
with
the
Law
Society
of
Ireland
in
interrogate
that
dynamic
as
well
as
engage
with
Insurance
Ireland
.
the
issue
of
cartel
-
like
behaviour
do
come
into
play
.
if
Insurance
Ireland
have
a
finite
membership
compose
of
the
big
house
and
if
Zenith
Insurance
,
which
be
exite
the
market
,
be
say
that
it
do
not
have
access
to
datum
,
it
be
clear
that
there
be
a
blocking
mechanism
there
by
certain
element
of
the
insurance
sector
to
ensure
there
be
incomplete
access
to
information
by
either
the
Irish
Brokers
Association
or
some
of
the
insurance
player
in
the
market
.
if
we
can
tackle
that
element
,
we
can
introduce
datum
share
among
insurance
provider
.
if
datum
share
be
introduce
it
would
sort
out
the
taxi
driver
that
Mr.
Herron
be
represent
.
to
have
a
situation
where
there
be
only
three
insurance
company
provide
insurance
for
the
Taxi
driver
'
federation
seem
to
I
to
be
a
ludicrous
scenario
give
the
importance
of
taxi
to
how
we
operate
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
of
the
witness
's
perspective
on
or
perception
of
how
Insurance
Ireland
and
its
member
operate
and
whether
they
perceive
there
to
be
a
blocking
mechanism
in
relation
to
datum
.
to
return
to
the
PIAB
,
if
we
could
have
transparency
around
the
datum
from
claim
settle
out
of
court
,
it
would
sort
many
of
the
people
who
be
rent
car
in
this
country
.
it
would
sort
many
of
the
problem
for
the
provider
in
that
sector
.
I
want
to
make
one
small
point
on
the
staging
of
accident
before
I
let
the
witness
back
in
.
Mr.
Redmond
touch
on
the
issue
of
soft
tissue
injury
.
he
state
he
have
no
confidence
in
the
review
unless
it
benchmark
against
European
Union
norm
.
if
we
have
a
situation
here
,
for
instance
,
whereby
small
claim
for
minor
injury
such
as
whiplash
be
deal
with
by
thing
like
voucher
for
access
to
medical
service
,
it
could
then
be
monitor
on
a
ongoing
basis
.
be
that
something
that
the
witness
's
member
would
accept
?
essentially
,
there
be
a
point
to
be
make
on
the
issue
of
access
or
open
up
the
market
to
insurance
on
a
pan-European
basis
or
throughout
the
European
Union
.
if
I
understand
Mr.
McDonnell
correctly
,
what
he
be
say
be
that
there
be
a
inconsistency
in
what
haulier
be
be
quote
by
the
same
company
.
that
be
something
the
committee
need
to
take
on
board
.
I
will
leave
it
there
but
before
I
conclude
I
would
like
to
get
the
perspective
of
Mr.
Redmond
on
the
soft
tissue
injury
issue
and
what
seem
to
be
a
friction
vis-à
-
vis
the
Law
Society
view
.
to
clarify
that
-----
have
the
car
Rental
Council
engage
with
the
cost
of
insurance
working
group
set
up
by
the
minister
?
no
,
I
mean
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Eoghan
Murphy
,
who
be
chair
a
working
group
on
this
issue
.
be
the
position
the
same
for
Mr.
Herron
and
Mr.
McDonnell
?
I
recommend
that
this
committee
endorse
any
approach
by
the
four
witness
present
and
they
organisation
to
engage
with
the
working
group
further
on
this
issue

I
thank
the
witness
for
come
before
the
committee
.
I
want
to
drill
down
to
this
issue
of
datum
.
it
seem
there
be
not
perfect
knowledge
in
term
of
how
the
industry
operate
.
we
do
not
have
perfect
knowledge
except
through
the
report
we
have
from
the
PIAB
.
its
submission
to
the
committee
give
the
average
award
from
2009
-
15
,
which
be
approximately
€
23000
.
the
PIAB
submission
state
there
be
:
...
no
public
information
available
relate
to
overall
number
and
cost
of
claim
for
personal
injury
and
the
only
figure
that
be
make
public
do
not
contain
any
information
on
the
cost
of
directly
settle
case
.
without
access
to
that
information
,
a
full
picture
of
the
impact
on
insurance
premium
be
difficult
to
establish
...
the
Irish
Brokers
Association
,
IBA
,
submission
state
the
same
thing
.
I
be
try
to
grapple
with
the
issue
.
insurance
Ireland
through
its
public
utterance
in
the
past
48
hour
or
so
have
be
quote
from
"
independent
datum
source
"
,
from
the
injury
Board
figure
,
from
the
bodily
injury
review
publish
by
the
Central
Bank
and
from
the
OECD
report
which
state
that
Ireland
be
the
eighth
most
expensive
country
in
which
to
enforce
a
contract
,
give
the
average
award
of
a
circuit
Court
increase
by
21.2
%
in
2015
,
follow
a
13.5
%
increase
in
2014
.
the
point
I
be
get
at
be
that
I
do
understand
why
Insurance
Ireland
be
not
share
datum
.
first
,
I
be
make
a
assertion
that
be
it
not
,
so
the
witness
can
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
and
I
would
like
to
get
the
iba
position
on
that
.
if
we
have
perfect
knowledge
in
regard
to
all
of
the
claim
,
we
would
be
able
to
drill
down
to
the
reason
people
's
premium
have
go
up
by
70
%
to
80
%
or
why
some
people
be
not
be
insure
at
all
.
to
give
a
example
I
have
use
before
,
if
a
premium
go
from
€500
on
a
Thursday
to
a
cost
of
€
800
,
which
be
a
surcharge
of
€300
,
what
percentage
of
that
€300
be
what
I
call
super
-
normal
profit
and
what
percentage
be
attributable
to
the
cost
of
the
historical
decrease
in
insurance
and
the
provisioning
that
be
necessary
?
the
witness
should
correct
I
if
my
analysis
of
the
situation
be
wrong
.
I
be
direct
my
question
in
the
first
instance
specifically
to
the
IBA
.
the
second
element
I
need
a
answer
on
be
in
regard
to
Zenith
.
there
seem
to
be
a
contradictory
position
between
what
insurance
Ireland
be
say
and
what
Zenith
be
say
.
if
I
understand
Mr.
Humphrey
correctly
-
he
be
on
the
public
record
so
I
have
no
issue
about
name
he
here
-
he
be
say
Zenith
be
exite
the
market
because
it
do
not
have
access
to
proper
datum
.
if
so
,
I
would
like
to
have
a
assessment
or
a
view
from
the
IBA
as
to
why
that
be
the
case
or
what
its
take
be
on
that
.
I
be
very
take
by
a
point
in
the
IBA
submission
,
which
state
:
"
all
gardaí
should
have
apnr
equipment
so
they
can
scan
registration
to
see
if
they
be
insure
,
and
the
requirement
for
insurance
disc
should
be
abolish
.
"
if
we
think
about
that
logically
,
the
driver
get
the
insurance
disc
in
the
post
and
slot
it
into
the
pouch
on
the
window
,
and
the
technology
now
exist
to
scan
or
copy
it
in
order
to
create
a
false
disc
.
if
we
be
depend
on
a
garda
at
a
checkpoint
with
hundred
of
vehicle
pass
through
to
intimately
examine
the
disc
,
there
be
a
case
to
be
make
for
the
APNR
model
so
this
can
be
base
on
check
of
registration
,
and
we
can
look
at
the
enforcement
procedure
thereafter
.
what
this
committee
be
try
to
do
be
to
drill
down
into
what
it
be
that
we
need
to
recommend
by
way
of
solution
.
I
will
come
back
to
Ms
Dowling
in
the
second
part
of
the
meeting
as
she
suggest
there
be
a
potential
legislative
solution
to
this
.
that
be
my
open
remark
and
I
will
come
back
in
again
late
,
if
I
may
.
be
Mr.
Carty
tell
we
he
have
access
to
the
datum
?
I
just
want
to
drill
down
into
this
.
if
Mr.
Carty
have
access
to
risk
intelligence
,
presumably
that
form
the
pricing
mechanism
.
I
think
it
be
good
that
we
make
this
distinction
now
.
we
be
begin
to
drill
down
into
the
nub
of
this
now
.
if
the
insurance
I
be
pay
for
suddenly
increase
by
20
%
or
30
%
,
I
will
scratch
my
head
.
most
people
will
accept
that
historically
,
it
might
have
come
down
for
a
certain
demographic
.
where
be
the
loading
?
Mr.
Carty
have
refer
to
the
SFCR
.
if
I
be
interpret
he
correctly
,
he
hint
that
the
corporate
be
rejig
balance
sheet
and
prepare
for
the
Solvency
ii
rule
.
it
seem
to
I
that
the
victim
in
this
,
if
I
can
use
that
word
,
be
the
people
who
be
drive
car
in
Ireland
.
regardless
of
the
age
of
they
vehicle
or
they
own
age
,
they
risk
profile
have
not
increase
over
a
short
period
of
time
.
it
do
not
matter
if
they
car
be
three
month
old
or
30
year
old
.
if
they
have
pass
the
nct
,
they
be
roadworthy
.
this
be
the
point
.
it
seem
to
I
that
ordinary
people
be
become
victim
or
pawn
in
a
big
corporate
game
.
there
be
a
bit
of
re-provisioning
go
on
.
there
be
pressure
to
adhere
to
the
sfcr
rule
or
the
Solvency
ii
rule
.
there
be
a
bit
of
naked
profiteering
go
on
as
well
.
this
be
why
the
joint
committee
want
to
drill
down
into
the
issue
of
public
knowledge
.
the
market
be
not
perfectly
competitive
.
if
it
be
,
anyone
who
want
to
enter
the
market
tomorrow
would
have
perfect
knowledge
of
all
element
of
datum
.
the
injury
Board
be
tell
we
one
story
.
as
it
be
a
public
body
,
we
absolutely
believe
in
the
veracity
of
its
figure
.
not
everybody
be
go
through
the
injury
Board
.
why
be
the
insurance
company
settle
?
we
know
there
be
a
constitutional
case
relate
to
the
right
to
legal
representation
.
I
have
sympathy
for
the
iba
position
in
respect
of
transparency
around
the
insurance
system
and
the
measure
that
can
be
take
.
everyone
be
say
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
datum
.
we
do
not
have
perfect
knowledge
from
the
insurance
industry
.
maybe
we
have
to
wait
for
Insurance
Ireland
to
come
in
late
on
to
drill
down
into
that
element
of
it
.
until
we
have
that
,
we
be
really
at
nothing
here
.
on
that
-----
before
he
come
in
,
I
would
like
to
say
it
appear
that
the
datum
be
proprietorial
,
in
effect
.
it
be
questionable
whether
we
can
legislate
to
make
that
datum
available
to
all
comer
.
I
would
welcome
a
view
on
that
.
if
the
datum
be
of
a
comprehensive
nature
,
and
if
they
profile
every
single
purchaser
of
insurance
,
we
can
crack
the
nut
here
by
get
access
to
they
.
that
be
really
what
we
be
try
to
drill
down
into
.
I
thank
Ms
Dowling
for
come
in
because
I
think
she
have
give
we
a
angle
with
which
to
question
Insurance
Ireland
on
the
issue
of
datum
.
I
suppose
what
I
want
to
ask
be
whether
it
be
possible
.
if
it
be
suppose
to
be
a
perfectly
competitive
market
,
that
who
want
to
enter
the
market
should
have
access
to
all
the
information
they
need
to
do
so
.
if
there
be
a
blocking
mechanism
,
there
be
a
suggestion
that
cartel
-
like
behaviour
could
be
at
play
.
we
will
have
a
opportunity
late
to
discuss
whether
that
be
the
case
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
from
Ms
Dowling
and
the
representative
of
the
iba
of
whether
they
believe
this
sector
be
operate
in
a
cartel
-
like
manner
.
if
Insurance
Ireland
be
not
give
we
access
to
all
the
datum
we
require
in
the
interest
of
transparency
and
to
enable
the
Oireachtas
to
make
a
set
of
recommendation
that
can
potentially
be
legislate
on
,
it
be
arguable
that
we
be
on
the
back
foot
.
we
have
to
distinguish
between
Mr.
Carty
as
a
underwriter
and
the
iba
position
for
the
purpose
of
this
.
I
want
to
come
at
the
datum
issue
from
a
different
angle
.
let
we
start
at
the
beginning
,
because
the
CCPC
have
say
it
be
go
to
open
up
a
investigation
into
,
to
use
Ms
O'Leary
's
term
,
the
issue
of
pricing
prediction
or
intention
that
"
may
result
in
a
degree
of
unspoken
co-ordination
"
.
what
do
the
expression
"
unspoken
co-ordination
"
mean
,
in
layman
's
term
?
could
the
witness
speak
to
the
punter
who
have
see
a
50
%
increase
in
they
insurance
premium
?
what
do
"
unspoken
co-ordination
"
mean
?
what
Mr.
Kenny
be
tell
I
,
as
somebody
who
have
just
see
a
increase
in
they
own
premium
,
in
layman
's
term
be
that
this
could
be
adjudicate
or
there
could
be
concern
around
cartel
-
like
behaviour
in
that
instance
.
Mr.
Kenny
use
the
analogy
of
the
smoke
-
fill
room
.
if
one
fast
-
forward
to
modern
language
,
it
be
air
-
condition
room
in
glass
tower
,
on
the
15th
floor
,
but
it
be
the
same
type
of
behaviour
,
where
a
influence
be
be
bring
to
bear
on
the
market
in
the
context
of
pricing
.
whatever
way
one
parse
the
language
,
what
Mr.
Kenny
be
essentially
tell
we
,
on
behalf
of
a
statutory
agency
or
body
,
be
that
there
be
a
concern
about
cartel
-
like
behaviour
.
let
we
not
be
too
prescriptive
on
the
word
"
cartel
"
as
Mr.
Kenny
have
elucidate
it
to
we
.
that
be
de
facto
cartel
-
like
behaviour
,
where
one
be
influence
the
price
determination
for
a
project
.
the
Chairman
have
raise
the
issue
of
datum
.
we
know
what
the
injury
Board
pay
out
,
but
there
be
a
whole
indeterminable
figure
that
we
do
not
know
in
respect
of
settlement
.
we
do
not
know
the
true
cost
of
settlement
because
there
be
not
perfect
knowledge
.
if
the
CCPC
be
investigate
this
without
have
access
to
the
three
so
-
call
database
,
it
could
be
argue
-
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
-
that
it
be
on
the
back
foot
in
respect
of
this
investigation
.
unless
it
can
get
access
to
what
be
on
Insurance
Ireland
's
database
,
then
,
short
of
a
legislative
change
,
Insurance
Ireland
could
block
the
ccpc
out
of
that
and
not
give
it
access
to
the
database
.
I
do
not
know
how
the
legislation
could
be
change
.
Ms
O'Leary
allude
to
this
matter
early
,
and
forgive
I
if
I
be
incorrect
,
but
if
there
be
any
number
of
insurance
house
in
this
country
and
they
be
all
under
a
umbrella
organisation
and
not
everybody
have
access
to
the
database
vis
-à
-
vis
settlement
out
of
court
-
about
which
figure
there
be
no
perfect
knowledge
,
generally
speak
-
then
how
be
the
ccpc
go
to
crack
this
nut
?
what
be
it
go
to
do
?
where
be
the
power
of
compellability
in
respect
of
that
datum
from
the
CCPC
's
point
of
view
?
if
it
do
get
access
to
that
datum
,
what
can
it
do
to
assure
consumer
that
they
premium
will
reduce
as
a
result
?
I
have
be
use
the
follow
analogy
for
the
past
few
day
:
if
my
insurance
premium
have
go
from
€500
to
€
800
,
which
be
a
€300
increase
,
what
proportion
of
that
€300
increase
be
reprovision
or
rebalance
?
what
proportion
of
that
be
to
deal
with
the
Solvency
ii
rule
or
the
financial
system
control
review
report
?
what
proportion
of
it
be
absolute
and
naked
profiteering
?
where
will
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
come
in
to
shed
light
on
that
for
the
people
we
represent
?
forgive
I
,
I
have
no
wish
to
confuse
the
issue
.
from
a
statutory
point
of
view
,
do
the
commission
have
the
power
to
go
into
any
insurance
house
?
the
commission
be
investigate
the
sector
,
effectively
.
do
it
have
the
power
or
remit
to
go
in
to
any
insurance
house
,
any
of
the
big
name
?
three
of
the
big
name
in
the
world
in
this
sector
begin
with
the
letter
a
.
can
representative
of
the
commission
go
in
to
that
house
and
explain
that
they
work
for
the
CCCP
and
want
access
to
all
the
datum
on
pay
-
out
?
we
know
what
the
injury
Board
be
do
.
there
be
perfect
knowledge
of
its
activity
and
the
average
level
of
claim
.
can
commission
representative
ask
this
firm
about
what
be
on
the
database
?
the
commission
obviously
do
believe
that
.
otherwise
,
it
would
not
have
notify
of
the
fact
that
it
be
undertake
a
investigation
.
be
that
not
the
nub
of
it
?
we
be
talk
about
huge
increase
in
premia
.
the
commission
have
receive
complaint
.
we
already
know
the
scenario
.
let
we
suppose
a
person
's
car
have
a
nct
certificate
,
he
be
over
a
certain
age
,
the
car
be
roadworthy
and
he
have
never
be
a
risk
before
.
then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
be
pay
a
50
%
increase
in
he
car
insurance
.
there
be
no
justifiable
reason
for
it
if
insurance
pricing
be
base
on
risk
and
there
be
no
change
to
the
risk
.
then
,
obviously
,
there
be
behaviour
within
the
industry
that
be
determine
the
investigation
.
can
the
commission
compel
the
insurance
industry
to
yield
onto
Caesar
they
database
,
which
show
the
level
of
claim
that
be
settle
out
of
court
?
we
,
as
ordinary
citizen
,
have
no
knowledge
of
this
.
that
be
where
the
gap
in
datum
materialise
.
if
we
be
talk
about
absolute
transparency
,
then
we
need
to
have
access
to
the
datum
.
now
,
from
where
I
be
sit
,
there
be
only
one
relevant
entity
,
aside
from
the
Central
Bank
report
and
the
injury
Board
.
it
be
opaque
and
there
be
no
perfect
knowledge
relate
to
the
datum
.
can
the
CCPC
ask
that
question
?
from
the
consumer
's
point
of
view
,
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
have
issue
summonse
to
the
motor
insurance
provider
.
the
commission
press
release
clearly
state
that
there
be
a
signalling
of
price
increase
.
if
the
commission
cannot
get
access
to
the
reasoning
behind
the
price
increase
,
even
on
issue
like
re-balancing
,
provisioning
or
the
historical
reduction
in
premia
in
recent
year
,
then
what
do
a
successful
outcome
of
the
commission
investigation
look
like
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
consumer
?
let
we
not
couch
language
here
.
the
people
watch
this
online
want
a
simple
answer
.
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
be
go
in
now
to
take
a
look
at
the
insurance
sector
,
as
it
relate
to
motorist
.
that
will
give
people
some
degree
of
comfort
,
but
it
will
only
give
they
comfort
if
they
know
there
be
a
outcome
that
result
in
a
reduction
in
premium
price
.
what
do
that
mean
?
what
be
the
delta
on
the
price
?
the
commission
can
make
a
determination
that
there
be
a
increase
in
price
as
a
result
of
what
criterion
?
in
effect
,
there
be
no
justice
or
restorative
function
of
the
commission
in
that
regard
.
the
commission
can
make
a
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
statement
.
essentially
,
as
far
as
the
commission
go
,
this
investigation
could
take
how
long
,
roughly
?
we
live
in
the
political
world
.
with
all
due
respect
,
I
be
not
satisfied
with
hear
that
speed
be
the
friend
of
success
.
the
people
watch
this
want
to
know
.
the
commission
be
a
statutory
body
and
one
of
the
commissioner
,
Mr.
Kenny
,
be
before
the
committee
.
can
Mr.
Kenny
give
we
a
timeframe
by
which
the
investigation
will
be
complete
?
what
could
the
outcome
potentially
be
after
the
investigation
?
if
the
commission
make
finding
against
the
insurance
industry
,
what
recourse
do
the
commission
have
?
Mr.
Kenny
have
not
give
we
a
timeline
.
he
have
say
month
but
we
need
to
be
more
definitive
.
if
it
run
to
court
proceedings
after
that
,
then
this
could
conceivably
take
year
.
I
be
press
Mr.
Kenny
because
if
we
have
to
wait
for
the
CCPC
to
make
a
determination
but
the
industry
have
already
signal
a
20
%
increase
for
next
year
,
then
it
seem
to
I
the
firm
be
not
go
to
stop
that
increase
pend
the
investigation
the
commission
intend
to
carry
out
.
therefore
,
the
consumer
will
still
end
up
pay
more
.
not
only
will
the
consumer
be
subject
to
the
2016
increase
,
he
will
also
be
front
-
load
with
2017
increase
as
well
while
this
investigation
be
go
on
.
can
the
commission
stop
the
increase
while
the
investigation
be
go
on
?
with
all
due
respect
,
Mr.
Kenny
cannot
say
that
definitively
.
that
be
a
rather
subjective
statement
.
the
proof
of
the
pudding
in
that
case
will
become
evident
.
as
Mr.
Kenny
have
say
,
there
be
potentially
a
year
in
this
.
he
cannot
say
for
sure
that
premia
will
not
actually
increase
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
have
signal
that
it
will
undertake
a
investigation
.
I
will
close
out
on
this
point
.
what
we
be
hear
be
that
the
commission
will
look
at
one
element
of
what
be
effectively
a
much
big
picture
,
if
I
be
to
sum
up
its
contribution
.
as
the
Chairman
articulate
,
there
be
still
the
issue
of
datum
,
of
have
perfect
knowledge
within
the
sector
.
it
be
clear
that
in
the
absence
of
perfect
knowledge
,
we
,
as
legislator
,
be
in
the
dark
.
if
we
be
expect
by
the
consumer
to
make
a
set
of
recommendation
,
until
we
have
access
to
that
datum
and
that
database
,
in
term
of
the
qualitative
analysis
of
that
datum
,
the
industry
can
continue
to
behave
as
it
have
behave
.
obviously
not
in
the
Irish
market
-
it
be
anonymised
and
share
but
only
among
that
who
be
in
the
large
organisation
,
which
be
Insurance
Ireland
.
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
investigate
that
late
.
to
corroborate
what
the
Chairman
be
say
,
the
injury
Board
have
state
that
there
be
no
public
information
available
in
respect
of
overall
number
and
cost
of
claim
for
personal
injury
as
the
only
figure
that
have
be
make
public
do
not
contain
any
information
on
the
number
or
cost
of
directly
settle
case
.
it
state
that
without
access
to
this
information
,
a
full
picture
of
the
impact
of
personal
injury
claim
on
insurance
premium
be
difficult
to
establish
.
the
witness
can
tell
we
that
the
commission
be
look
at
the
notify
intention
to
increase
pricing
but
that
be
still
only
one
element
of
it
.
after
this
submission
,
we
still
will
not
know
whether
there
be
a
legislative
basis
that
can
be
provide
or
whether
a
case
can
be
make
for
legislate
for
perfect
knowledge
within
the
industry
aside
from
whether
or
not
one
be
a
member
that
be
lock
in
or
out
of
insurance
Ireland
or
whether
one
be
a
broker
,
a
underwriter
,
a
small
indigenous
insurance
house
or
a
large
international
insurance
house
.
it
remain
the
case
that
if
there
be
a
proprietorial
element
to
that
datum
,
there
could
be
all
kind
of
constitutional
provision
around
that
in
respect
of
who
own
the
datum
,
who
mind
it
and
how
one
interpret
it
.
we
can
have
all
sort
of
assessment
and
can
make
a
rough
adjudication
on
what
be
in
the
book
of
quantum
.
we
have
already
hear
that
the
book
of
quantum
need
to
be
update
.
Ms
Dorothea
Dowling
tell
we
that
one
can
go
from
€
400000
maxima
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
-
she
mention
a
injury
to
a
quadriplegic
level
-
to
a
minor
injury
like
a
soft
tissue
injury
,
add
a
percentage
and
extrapolate
a
award
from
that
.
perhaps
we
have
to
wait
and
see
what
Insurance
Ireland
tell
we
but
I
be
try
to
ascertain
here
whether
or
not
we
can
provide
a
legislative
base
to
compel
the
sector
to
anonymise
the
datum
and
give
it
up
.
there
be
separation
of
power
but
that
would
at
least
provide
guidance
for
the
Judiciary
,
where
something
be
not
settle
through
the
injury
board
,
to
allow
it
to
quantify
the
extent
of
the
damage
so
that
there
be
no
back
-
loading
or
front
-
load
on
the
cost
of
premium
.
no
matter
what
way
one
parse
this
,
there
must
be
a
element
of
profiteering
here
if
a
premium
increase
overnight
by
50
%
,
60
%
or
70
%
or
if
certain
people
have
be
lock
out
of
the
market
when
by
any
objective
analysis
they
level
of
risk
have
not
increase
.
my
level
of
risk
have
not
increase
from
9
to
10
September
when
I
renew
my
car
insurance
.
do
the
witness
see
my
point
?
can
the
commission
adjudicate
?
from
a
competition
law
perspective
,
can
the
commission
adjudicate
on
the
nature
of
the
share
of
that
information
intra
industry
as
oppose
to
the
public
domain
in
term
of
the
deliberation
we
have
in
this
committee
?
someone
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
but
to
reinforce
what
the
Chairman
say
,
Zenith
,
which
I
can
name
because
it
be
on
the
public
record
,
be
tell
we
through
the
Irish
Brokers
Association
that
it
be
de
facto
lock
out
of
a
process
of
datum
share
relate
to
the
market
.
we
be
tell
there
be
three
fundamental
database
,
but
it
appear
that
not
everybody
operate
within
the
market
,
or
seek
to
become
a
member
,
can
access
they
.
it
be
like
a
club
,
I
suppose
.
if
somebody
be
in
Insurance
Ireland
,
he
or
she
be
away
on
a
hack
,
so
to
speak
,
as
the
person
would
know
the
pricing
mechanism
and
how
to
game
the
pricing
system
.
I
use
the
word
"
game
"
as
the
person
would
have
perfect
knowledge
of
reserve
and
how
much
of
a
profit
can
be
make
.
even
take
historical
factor
into
account
,
we
be
tell
there
be
a
reduction
in
the
market
for
premium
,
with
certain
player
try
to
get
to
the
top
of
the
market
or
have
the
most
market
share
,
result
in
a
reduction
in
premium
cost
,
but
all
of
a
sudden
there
be
a
reset
go
on
.
if
that
be
happen
,
one
do
not
set
a
price
base
on
a
intention
to
earn
super
-
normal
profit
.
the
price
be
clearly
be
reset
base
on
the
fact
that
there
must
be
resetting
of
the
market
to
meet
reserve
,
the
Solvency
ii
rule
and
what
we
speak
of
early
.
it
would
appear
the
insurance
sector
be
confine
its
behaviour
to
a
certain
number
of
large
firm
,
to
the
detriment
of
other
player
.
on
the
face
of
it
,
that
be
what
appear
to
be
happen
.
they
be
use
Setanta
as
cover
for
that
.
they
be
use
the
dysfunction
in
the
market
as
a
resetting
mechanism
to
profiteer
.
that
be
the
theory
here
.
it
come
back
to
whether
we
can
legislate
to
get
access
to
datum
.
Ms
O'Leary
be
begin
to
elucidate
the
point
that
there
be
a
difference
between
what
happen
internally
within
the
market
and
what
be
in
the
public
domain
.
that
distinction
have
be
make
.
through
the
chair
,
I
ask
Senator
Horkan
to
forgive
I
for
cut
across
he
.
who
talk
about
datum
without
know
what
it
be
?
Mr.
Horan
should
be
specific
because
if
he
be
lay
that
at
the
door
of
member
,
I
would
say
bí
Cúramach
because
it
be
a
integral
part
of
what
we
be
talk
about
here
today
,
about
parse
out
the
issue
of
datum
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
come
into
we
today
.
there
have
be
a
focus
on
datum
.
I
be
look
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
whether
the
market
be
competitive
.
whether
it
be
perfectly
competitive
or
not
remain
to
be
see
.
there
be
still
a
fundamental
question
about
whether
there
be
perfect
knowledge
around
the
market
.
we
all
recognise
there
have
to
be
a
surplus
on
every
premium
derive
by
a
company
.
that
be
a
give
but
we
be
find
it
difficult
to
reconcile
the
extent
to
which
premia
have
increase
.
it
be
a
steep
,
unaffordable
rise
.
if
insurance
company
be
price
risk
and
liability
and
if
by
any
reasonable
,
objective
analysis
the
individual
motorist
's
personal
circumstance
have
not
change
,
the
car
have
pass
its
nct
test
and
nothing
have
change
from
the
motorist
's
point
of
view
yet
they
be
incur
a
cost
of
30
%
,
40
%
or
50
%
they
be
ask
themselves
,
"
what
be
go
on
here
?
"
.
most
people
will
accept
the
argument
around
the
resetting
of
the
market
to
adhere
to
rule
and
provisioning
.
the
witness
's
open
statement
outline
that
the
price
of
premium
have
reduce
significantly
over
quite
a
number
of
year
.
what
most
people
cannot
reconcile
be
the
extent
of
the
increase
.
I
have
listen
carefully
to
what
Mr.
Horan
be
say
about
the
datum
.
he
speak
about
the
private
motor
insurance
statistic
report
in
2015
,
the
IIDS
,
the
ANPR
and
so
on
.
in
the
personal
injury
Assessment
Board
's
submission
to
we
it
state
there
be
:
...
no
public
information
available
relate
to
overall
number
and
cost
of
claim
for
personal
injury
and
the
only
figure
that
be
make
public
do
not
contain
any
information
on
the
cost
of
directly
settle
case
.
without
access
to
that
information
,
a
full
picture
of
the
impact
[
of
personal
injury
claim
]
on
insurance
premium
be
difficult
to
establish
.
if
we
take
insurance
Ireland
's
submission
before
we
today
and
its
willingness
to
seek
a
solution
to
this
issue
and
layer
on
the
fact
that
it
be
say
there
be
adequate
datum
available
to
make
a
assessment
of
the
market
,
why
be
it
that
the
PIAB
,
which
be
a
statutory
body
,
be
tell
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
there
be
not
perfect
knowledge
?
how
do
the
witness
reconcile
this
statement
?
what
do
scope
out
a
exercise
mean
?
if
Insurance
Ireland
provide
statistic
to
the
Central
Bank
then
yes
,
there
be
statistic
,
but
the
issue
be
how
they
be
mine
for
quantitative
analysis
of
the
datum
so
that
decision
can
be
make
.
will
the
scoping
exercise
,
whatever
that
be
,
result
in
transparency
around
the
cost
of
a
premium
?
there
be
no
breakdown
of
the
cost
of
a
average
motorist
's
premium
.
person
accept
the
insurance
company
must
make
a
surplus
on
the
premium
and
accept
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
a
rejigging
or
resetting
of
provisioning
,
but
they
do
not
accept
the
stark
increase
.
the
witness
still
have
not
explain
this
,
not
even
in
they
open
submission
.
there
be
nothing
in
the
open
submission
,
with
all
due
respect
,
or
in
the
subsequent
reply
which
answer
for
the
ordinary
motorist
the
question
as
to
why
premium
have
increase
.
the
witness
have
not
speak
to
we
about
behaviour
in
the
insurance
industry
regard
the
settling
of
claim
-
whether
the
insurance
company
interrogate
fully
every
claim
that
come
before
they
,
or
whether
they
settle
they
just
to
get
they
off
the
desk
and
out
the
door
.
we
do
not
know
who
the
member
of
Insurance
Ireland
be
.
the
witness
state
that
it
be
representative
of
95
%
of
the
domestic
market
but
,
presumably
,
all
of
the
big
insurance
house
be
member
of
Insurance
Ireland
also
.
we
know
it
be
a
not
-
for
-
profit
organisation
.
we
be
all
intelligent
people
here
,
presumably
,
so
we
know
Insurance
Ireland
get
its
riding
instruction
from
that
pay
subscription
.
the
question
be
whether
Insurance
Ireland
be
here
to
speak
for
all
of
its
member
,
include
the
big
insurance
house
.
we
now
hear
there
will
be
a
investigation
by
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
,
but
we
be
none
the
wise
more
than
half
a
hour
into
this
proceedings
.
I
be
still
ignorant
as
to
why
there
have
be
such
a
stark
increase
.
the
witness
state
that
the
datum
be
available
,
but
clearly
it
be
not
.
I
apologise
for
cut
across
Mr.
Thompson
,
but
now
we
be
drill
down
into
the
nub
of
this
.
he
state
that
the
datum
be
proprietary
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
state
that
Insurance
Ireland
be
yield
up
sufficient
datum
to
statutory
organisation
and
the
Central
Bank
.
effectively
,
he
be
give
the
impression
,
with
regard
to
its
intervention
,
that
there
be
perfect
knowledge
in
the
sector
because
he
state
it
have
the
IIDS
and
InsuranceLink
,
notwithstand
the
anpr
issue
,
and
the
private
motor
statistic
with
the
Central
Bank
.
insurance
Ireland
be
create
a
impression
that
it
be
yield
the
datum
unto
Caesar
,
so
to
speak
,
but
it
be
not
tell
we
,
in
very
real
and
simple
term
,
why
the
increase
be
happen
.
we
accept
a
certain
degree
of
provisioning
and
resetting
in
the
market
,
and
we
accept
that
the
insurance
company
need
to
make
a
degree
of
profit
,
but
not
to
this
extent
.
we
do
not
have
visibility
as
premium
holder
of
the
level
of
profit
that
will
be
make
and
the
stark
increase
that
have
be
make
.
this
be
the
real
issue
for
motorist
.
to
be
fair
about
it
,
the
risk
profile
for
the
vast
bulk
of
motorist
by
any
actuarial
standard
have
not
actually
increase
.
we
do
not
have
perfect
knowledge
on
what
insurance
company
settle
out
of
court
on
the
step
with
solicitor
.
the
witness
will
not
give
we
this
information
.
the
reality
contradict
this
.
if
I
be
to
be
very
frank
and
blunt
,
insurance
be
a
hard
-
nosed
business
and
be
highly
competitive
.
the
company
have
shareholder
and
a
bottom
line
.
the
witness
cannot
come
into
the
Oireachtas
and
state
that
there
be
eight
aspiration
or
solution
to
this
and
that
the
sixth
be
to
reduce
legal
cost
,
when
we
know
,
anecdotally
and
factually
,
that
insurance
company
settle
out
of
court
without
investigate
to
a
large
extent
whether
a
claim
in
the
first
instance
be
fraudulent
,
or
where
there
be
a
history
of
repetitive
case
involve
people
who
be
up
and
down
the
step
before
it
go
into
the
courtroom
.
there
be
a
culture
of
settle
before
go
to
court
,
where
the
case
could
be
interrogate
properly
,
and
the
industry
be
not
take
on
the
fraudster
.
the
company
have
realise
it
be
much
easy
to
just
settle
and
get
case
off
the
book
and
off
the
table
.
the
second
solution
suggest
be
tackle
whiplash
.
the
witness
have
state
that
eight
out
of
ten
motor
insurance
claim
in
Ireland
be
for
whiplash
and
award
here
be
three
time
that
in
the
UK
.
they
state
that
premium
be
a
function
of
the
cost
of
claim
,
so
high
award
mean
high
premium
.
however
,
they
do
not
tell
we
the
percentage
of
this
whiplash
claim
which
be
settle
without
go
through
a
injury
board
process
or
be
settle
outside
the
door
of
the
court
.
until
we
can
drill
down
into
this
information
it
appear
that
the
insurance
industry
will
ride
the
storm
,
apply
the
further
20
%
increase
in
the
premium
already
signal
to
the
market
,
and
go
through
the
investigation
with
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
and
pay
lip
service
to
what
we
be
try
to
achieve
,
which
be
low
cost
for
motorist
.
it
be
plus
ça
change
,
plus
c'est
la
None
choose
.
there
be
no
evidence
here
that
the
industry
be
really
make
a
honest
effort
,
beyond
aspirational
language
,
to
reduce
premium
.
there
be
a
inverse
principle
at
work
here
.
Mr.
Thompson
have
say
that
the
industry
be
settle
more
and
tackle
fraudulent
claim
,
but
it
be
increase
premium
at
the
same
time
.
it
do
not
figure
.
I
wish
to
go
back
to
the
personal
injury
Assessment
Board
,
PIAB
,
statement
which
argue
that
there
be
no
public
information
available
on
the
overall
number
and
cost
of
claim
.
the
PIAB
have
access
to
the
same
report
that
Insurance
Ireland
furnish
to
the
Central
Bank
.
one
would
also
assume
that
because
it
interface
with
the
insurance
industry
all
the
time
,
it
have
access
to
InsuranceLink
or
can
get
a
sense
from
Insurance
Ireland
of
the
integrate
information
datum
service
,
iids
,
for
example
,
yet
there
be
a
contradiction
between
its
position
and
that
of
Insurance
Ireland
on
the
availability
of
information
.
yes

we

I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
he
official
for
come
before
the
joint
committee
.
the
flood
risk
management
scheme
in
Mallow
and
Fermoy
be
both
very
successful
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
say
the
final
account
will
be
agree
for
the
Mallow
south
and
Fermoy
south
scheme
in
2016
.
what
be
the
full
project
cost
in
2017
of
the
two
scheme
?
on
the
intervention
of
the
Minister
of
State
regard
the
memorandum
of
understanding
which
have
now
be
sign
with
the
OPW
,
I
know
for
a
fact
that
insurance
provider
represent
by
Insurance
Ireland
be
flatly
state
they
will
not
provide
flood
insurance
in
the
Munster
Blackwater
region
which
include
Fermoy
and
Mallow
.
what
be
the
response
of
the
Minister
of
State
?
if
both
area
have
a
flood
risk
management
scheme
which
have
be
test
and
prove
to
work
and
be
effective
and
certain
component
member
of
Insurance
Ireland
state
they
will
not
provide
insurance
in
certain
part
of
the
Munster
Blackwater
region
,
we
have
a
serious
issue
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
response
of
the
Minister
of
State
.
what
about
the
Insurance
Ireland
issue
?
to
be
helpful
,
the
demountable
flood
defence
have
be
prove
to
work
and
there
be
robust
engineering
evidence
of
this
.
the
man
and
woman
on
the
street
have
see
it
for
themselves
.
to
be
helpful
to
he
,
I
suggest
to
the
Minister
of
State
that
he
should
not
be
lead
a
merry
dance
by
Insurance
Ireland
because
it
speak
for
the
big
global
insurer
and
I
do
not
want
to
name
name
.
even
if
there
be
a
memorandum
of
understanding
,
the
question
be
what
be
the
extent
of
its
power
?
I
have
proof
which
I
will
furnish
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
through
the
Irish
Brokers
Association
which
tell
we
people
be
be
refuse
flood
insurance
in
town
such
as
Fermoy
and
Mallow
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
there
be
demountable
flood
defence
.
I
will
come
back
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
but
only
if
I
get
a
sense
from
he
that
he
will
use
the
full
weight
of
he
office
to
lean
on
the
insurance
provider
because
the
decision
take
by
the
insurance
industry
be
not
necessarily
take
in
Dublin
.
they
be
normally
take
in
Switzerland
,
London
or
any
of
the
global
capital
.
if
the
reinsurer
or
underwriter
be
not
cover
the
risk
,
with
all
due
respect
,
the
Minister
of
State
be
at
nothing
.
the
people
of
Carrigtwohill
regard
Barryscourt
Castle
as
a
major
resource
.
will
the
minister
of
State
give
a
definitive
date
as
to
when
it
will
open
?
what
do
I
tell
a
business
on
Bridge
Street
in
Mallow
or
a
business
in
Fermoy
?
the
response
of
the
Minister
of
State
suggest
Insurance
Ireland
be
look
for
bell
and
whistle
,
but
it
should
take
at
face
value
the
word
of
the
opw
if
it
state
the
demountable
defence
work
because
,
be
the
robust
organisation
that
it
be
,
it
will
not
state
this
unless
they
absolutely
work
.
we
have
all
see
that
they
work
.
if
Insurance
Ireland
be
look
for
condition
to
be
meet
before
it
will
insure
,
I
suggest
the
Minister
of
State
not
be
lead
on
a
merry
dance
by
it
.
it
be
about
have
tooth
in
the
game
.
my
final
question
be
very
specific
.
we
need
a
definitive
date
on
when
Barryscourt
Castle
will
reopen
.
I
would
like
to
know
the
operating
budget
for
Doneraile
Court
.
what
be
the
headline
budget
for
Anne's
Grove
Garden
,
a
recent
enough
addition
?
I
know
a
notification
have
go
out
on
open
the
facility
but
what
be
the
specific
date
on
which
it
will
be
open
to
the
public
?
I
suppose
I
be
ask
if
there
be
a
budget
line
.
I
appreciate
that
.
to
be
helpful
to
the
chairman
,
I
list
three
specific
facility
and
if
I
could
get
a
note
from
the
Minister
of
State
on
the
operating
budget
for
Doneraile
Court
,
the
work
require
for
Barryscourt
and
the
budget
therein
and
the
budget
require
for
Anne
's
Grove
its
prospective
opening
time
,
I
would
be
happy
to
leave
it
at
that
.
I
thank
the
minister
and
he
official
for
attend
.

on
second
stage
we
assent
to
bring
the
Bill
to
this
stage
.
one
of
the
question
I
have
have
on
my
mind
for
some
time
have
be
where
the
Central
Bank
be
in
respect
of
its
position
on
mortgage
pricing
in
Ireland
.
there
be
a
report
from
2015
but
be
there
a
update
report
in
that
respect
?
I
do
not
necessarily
need
the
answer
now
.
it
seem
there
be
a
very
clear
position
within
the
Central
Bank
on
bank
profitability
.
the
report
state
that
equity
investor
,
whether
the
State
or
other
,
cannot
be
expect
to
inject
capital
if
a
return
in
the
form
of
profit
be
not
in
prospect
.
the
report
state
:
that
be
why
it
be
unrealistic
to
imagine
a
regime
even
in
the
long
-
run
in
which
mortgage
lending
rate
do
not
build
in
not
only
a
sufficient
spread
(
over
the
cost
of
fund
)
to
cover
the
credit
risk
be
undertake
,
but
also
make
a
adequate
contribution
to
profit
.
it
be
likely
,
however
,
that
the
rate
in
effect
for
most
bank
at
the
end
of
April
2015
[
which
be
when
the
report
be
publish
]
be
high
than
would
be
necessary
in
the
long
-
run
for
a
bank
unburden
by
a
poorly
perform
mortgage
back
book
.
could
we
get
a
perspective
from
the
Central
Bank
as
to
whether
this
view
point
have
be
update
?
it
would
be
pertinent
regard
deal
with
the
issue
of
competition
as
elucidate
by
the
minister
.
there
be
a
issue
regard
how
the
property
rights
of
some
creditor
would
be
affect
.
can
we
have
a
deep
dive
into
the
dynamic
of
the
property
rights
as
they
affect
that
people
who
pay
6
%
or
7
%
on
variable
rate
?
in
one
case
I
be
familiar
with
,
it
will
add
approximately
€
100000
to
the
cost
of
the
mortgage
over
its
lifetime
.
I
wonder
how
somebody
like
I
could
explain
to
the
person
that
it
be
a
constitutional
issue
in
which
the
property
rights
of
the
bank
or
financial
institution
take
precedence
.
it
be
a
little
unclear
.
perhaps
we
could
have
a
update
report
from
the
Central
Bank
on
the
standing
of
the
mortgage
book
in
that
respect
.
if
there
be
a
update
of
the
May
2015
report
influence
on
Standard
Variable
mortgage
pricing
in
Ireland
,
it
would
be
very
useful
.
be
this
a
precedent
in
the
history
of
the
House
?
the
minister
have
quote
from
the
document
I
refer
to
early
.
specifically
for
the
reason
outline
therein
I
ask
for
a
update
on
the
position
.
give
the
minister
's
intervention
,
it
be
clear
that
the
modus
operandi
of
the
Central
Bank
be
,
to
all
intent
and
purpose
in
relation
to
mortgage
lending
,
to
take
a
laissez
-
faire
approach
.
the
question
for
we
then
be
whether
we
can
legislate
for
the
cost
of
fund
and
a
percentage
over
and
above
that
.
for
the
purpose
of
this
engagement
we
be
fairly
clear
at
this
juncture
that
there
be
two
course
of
action
open
to
we
in
term
of
we
seek
legal
advice
and
further
engagement
with
the
European
Central
Bank
,
ECB
,
on
this
matter
.
from
my
perspective
,
at
this
juncture
we
should
move
on
.
unless
any
other
senator
be
interested
in
contribute
,
I
thank
Mr.
Burgess
,
Mr.
Goor
and
Mr.
McNally
for
attend
and
assist
the
committee
.

not
at
this
juncture
.
on
that
issue
,
I
be
go
to
wait
to
make
a
intervention
on
that
point
at
a
late
stage
because
it
be
something
on
which
we
would
need
clarity
.
the
Bill
will
be
very
specific
in
regard
to
that
point
.
it
need
further
tease
out
.
that
be
the
point
I
be
make
.
without
be
too
pedantic
,
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
do
that
.
we
be
not
close
out
that
issue
at
this
juncture
.
I
appreciate
that
we
be
talk
about
principle
here
and
that
this
be
the
head
of
a
Bill
.
however
,
head
43
refer
to
the
conduct
of
investigation
.
however
,
subsection
(
4
)
provide
,
"
the
ombudsman
may
,
in
the
course
of
investigate
a
complaint
,
periodically
report
to
the
complainant
on
the
progress
of
the
investigation
and
,
in
so
do
,
may
make
such
comment
to
the
complainant
on
the
investigation
and
its
consequence
and
implication
as
that
ombudsman
think
fit
.
"
what
be
mean
by
"
think
fit
"
or
deem
appropriate
perhaps
need
to
be
examine
.
will
the
minister
give
we
a
sense
of
the
guide
principle
?
we
can
compare
this
with
head
44
.
if
the
ombudsman
embark
on
a
process
of
mediation
and
the
complainant
or
the
ombudsman
feel
that
the
organisation
,
intermediary
or
institution
against
whom
the
complaint
be
be
make
be
merely
go
through
a
box
-
tick
exercise
to
be
see
to
be
go
along
with
a
process
,
what
kind
of
recourse
do
the
ombudsman
have
?
what
level
of
discretion
do
the
ombudsman
have
in
determine
that
the
financial
institution
be
not
play
ball
and
,
therefore
,
that
a
sanction
will
be
issue
?
if
the
document
be
prepare
for
the
purpose
of
the
mediation
,
some
of
it
may
not
be
deem
to
be
admissible
if
it
have
go
through
a
mediation
process
.
the
question
then
be
how
much
power
in
real
term
do
the
ombudsman
have
to
ensure
the
financial
institution
go
along
with
the
process
or
,
at
least
,
be
a
honest
party
to
the
process
.
yes
.
I
put
he
on
notice
by
ask
the
question

that
be
okay

will
Mr.
McLoughlin
throw
in
a
few
ticket
for
the
all
Black
game
while
he
be
at
it
?
there
be
nobody
here
to
do
that
.
with
all
due
respect
,
he
be
chair
the
meeting
.
I
want
to
refer
to
lending
to
small
and
medium
enterprise
,
sme
,
in
particular
.
Mr.
Boucher
will
be
aware
of
Horizon
2020
,
the
€80
billion
European
Union
research
and
innovation
programme
which
have
give
rise
to
the
InnovFin
fund
from
which
Bank
of
Ireland
,
in
partnership
with
the
European
investment
Fund
,
EIF
,
have
a
opportunity
to
avail
of
€
100
million
.
how
much
of
that
€
100
million
have
be
divest
for
new
lending
since
October
2015
when
Bank
of
Ireland
do
the
deal
with
the
EIF
?
I
ask
the
question
because
I
have
a
sense
that
at
branch
or
regional
level
-
I
do
not
know
if
agriculture
come
into
that
component
-
there
be
a
lot
of
new
lending
to
sme
in
gear
up
for
the
position
post
-
milk
quota
.
there
be
a
lot
of
investment
in
agricultural
lending
also
,
but
I
have
not
see
any
documentation
or
publication
from
Bank
of
Ireland
on
lending
in
the
technology
sector
.
if
Bank
of
Ireland
be
not
lend
in
the
technology
sector
,
a
elemental
part
of
the
InnovFin
fund
,
be
it
because
there
be
reticence
on
the
part
of
bank
-
I
believe
Bank
of
Ireland
be
the
only
bank
that
have
draw
down
funding
from
the
InnovFin
fund
-
to
lend
in
the
technology
sector
as
the
risk
profile
might
be
too
high
?
I
be
try
to
gain
a
understanding
of
where
Bank
of
Ireland
sit
on
lending
in
sector
other
than
,
for
instance
,
agriculture
or
traditional
sme
.
be
Mr.
McLoughlin
tell
I
that
Bank
of
Ireland
be
lend
in
that
sector
?
it
be
actively
engage
in
lending
.
would
it
be
possible
for
somebody
to
contact
I
or
come
back
to
the
committee
on
the
way
that
lending
which
be
vital
be
emerge
?
if
the
economy
be
expect
to
grow
and
we
be
talk
about
the
traditional
lending
profile
,
we
will
have
to
start
look
at
other
area
such
as
the
technology
sector
and
start
-
up
,
in
particular
.
to
finish
the
point
,
Bank
of
Ireland
will
have
to
carry
risk
and
the
question
be
whether
it
be
overly
conservative
about
carry
some
of
it
.
we
be
all
watch
closely
to
see
how
the
fund
of
€
100
million
will
be
divest
.
Mr.
Boucher
mention
Kernel
Capital
.
I
be
familiar
with
Kernel
Capital
in
Cork
which
be
part
of
its
footprint
.
how
many
job
be
create
or
what
be
the
level
of
economic
output
as
a
result
of
investment
by
company
such
as
Kernel
Capital
,
for
instance
?
I
be
try
to
gain
a
understanding
of
the
matter
.
I
do
not
expect
Mr.
Boucher
to
have
the
answer
to
that
question
now
,
but
if
somebody
could
revert
to
I
on
it
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
.
how
much
new
business
do
the
bank
generate
from
the
national
enterprise
week
?
it
have
be
firmly
in
the
mix
for
quite
a
number
of
year
and
it
be
good
profiling
at
local
level
for
business
,
but
do
it
generate
new
business
for
the
bank
or
be
it
just
a
marketing
tool
?
we
be
under
the
cosh
time
-
wise
.
I
know
Mr.
Boucher
have
be
here
for
a
few
hour
and
I
be
grateful
for
that
.
be
there
definitive
metric
in
term
of
the
national
enterprise
week
?
I
know
he
bolster
he
troops
to
go
out
and
generate
new
business
.
that
be
part
of
he
modus
operandi
.
what
I
be
try
to
understand
be
whether
it
generate
new
lending
and
new
business
and
whether
it
work
as
a
tool
.
I
want
to
ask
about
lending
to
the
agricultural
sector
.
I
come
from
Cork
and
represent
a
dairy
production
area
.
where
be
the
bank
of
Ireland
with
respect
to
the
other
bank
in
term
of
compete
for
new
business
in
that
space
?
be
it
highly
competitive
or
behind
the
curve
?
regard
the
Caherdavin
example
,
it
be
not
that
we
believe
old
people
be
not
engage
with
technology
.
it
would
be
futile
for
anybody
to
suggest
that
because
we
be
probably
the
close
to
the
people
on
the
ground
in
that
we
represent
they
every
day
of
the
week
.
the
angst
in
regard
to
the
branch
and
how
they
be
evolve
relate
to
the
deficit
in
the
personal
relationship
.
while
people
of
all
age
can
engage
with
the
bank
's
365
online
model
-
and
that
can
lead
to
subsequent
phone
call
with
a
person
-
the
concern
be
about
the
one
-
to
-
one
banking
relationship
.
it
be
in
that
context
that
we
be
to
articulate
the
point
regard
place
,
such
as
Caherdavin
,
where
the
bank
have
flashpoint
.
it
be
not
a
ageism
issue
.
I
be
a
customer
of
the
excellent
branch
in
Mallow
.
I
have
a
relationship
with
the
people
there
.
over
the
year
,
however
,
there
have
be
a
diminution
of
the
traditional
relationship
,
particularly
in
respect
of
people
go
into
the
branch
to
discuss
new
lending
or
borrowing
for
day
-
to
-
day
service
.
that
be
the
point
we
be
try
to
articulate
.
traditionally
,
the
pillar
bank
always
have
that
relationship
with
the
person
on
the
street
.
we
recognise
that
the
bank
of
Ireland
must
evolve
and
move
to
a
certain
point
and
that
there
be
cost
element
involve
,
but
it
should
not
throw
the
baby
out
with
the
bathwater
and
move
completely
to
a
online
process
.
if
it
be
to
do
that
,
customer
might
leave
.
customer
need
to
know
they
be
be
listen
to
and
they
need
to
have
eye
contact
with
a
official
in
the
bank
if
they
be
transact
new
business
or
even
deal
with
daily
transaction
.
do
Mr.
Boucher
understand
the
point
I
be
make
?
the
bank
have
take
a
big
stake
in
rugby
sponsorship
.
I
be
a
Munster
supporter
.
it
be
welcome
that
the
bank
have
a
large
footprint
in
the
province
.
be
it
possible
for
Mr.
Boucher
to
answer
how
much
that
sponsorship
be
cost
the
bank
and
whether
a
proportion
of
that
be
filter
down
into
encourage
young
people
,
male
and
female
,
into
the
game
?
my
thinking
here
be
from
a
CSR
perspective
,
as
oppose
to
mere
sponsorship
and
get
the
name
out
there
.
Mr.
Boucher
mention
flag
and
Leinster
.
we
be
talk
about
corporate
sponsorship
and
we
be
all
interested
in
the
growth
of
the
game
.
I
be
interested
in
discover
whether
parcel
of
that
funding
go
into
the
development
of
the
game
among
young
people
in
particular
.
Mr.
Farrell
be
nod
he
head
.
be
there
a
message
that
Mr.
Boucher
want
to
impart
about
how
he
be
concerned
about
the
future
of
the
game
and
that
this
be
not
merely
corporate
sponsorship
and
about
flag
?
what
I
be
try
to
tease
out
be
whether
that
sponsorship
actually
enhance
the
game
.

which
ask
the
number
of
btl

report
as
in

great
than
90

as
of
30

since
2013
,
when
the
bank
cite
a
figure
of
5000
,
it
now
have
2112
btl
mortgage
more
than
90
day
in
arrears
.
what
be
the
mechanism
by
which
the
bank
arrive
at
that
number
?
when
consider
the
btl
long
-
term
solution
,
Mr.
O'Sullivan
refer
specifically
to
the
reduce
payment
great
than
the
interest
rate
.
in
fairness
to
the
bank
,
it
have
provide
all
the
number
comprehensively
for
we
,
which
be
to
be
welcome

the
figure

if
there

1351
mortgage
holder
pay
a
reduce

that
be
great
than

,
wherein
lie
the
risk
?
this
committee
be
mindful
of
the
tenant
of
that
property
because
of
the
problem
of
homelessness
and
if
there
be
92
%
performance
on
the
loan
,
I
wonder
how
that
1351
will
play
out
.
be
there
security
of
tenure
?
while
the
bank
's
first
duty
be
to
the
mortgage
holder
,
do
it
feel
a
social
obligation
to
ensure
there
be
tenant
and
that
they
have
some
security
of
tenure
where
that
mortgage
fail
to
perform
?
specifically
on

Mr.
O'Sullivan
quote
the
figure
of
423
as
the
sum
total
of
rent
receiver
the
bank
have
in
place
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
sense
from
the
witness
of
the
fallout
from
Springboard
Mortgage
.
a
total
of
1372
customer
of
the
bank
be
in
line
for
substantial
refund
.
I
know
this
be
last
year
,
but
I
would
like
to
get
a
sense
of
whether
the
issue
have
resolve
itself
and
whether
the
bank
be
give
due
recognition
to
its
own
failing
in
regard
to
Springboard
,
where
people
lose
property
as
a
result
of
the
issue
.
to
give
a
context
,
it
be
just
the
learning
from
it
to
ensure
non-repetition
of
such
incident
in
the
banking
sector
.
do
Mr.
Mitchell
agree
a
certain
number
of
this
people
fall
into
arrears
and
lose
they
home
and
be
subsequently
compensate
?
how
be
the
bank
deal
with
this
people
?
do
it
have
a
protocol
in
place
to
recognise
they
loss
as
a
result
?
what
do
that
mean
?
it
sound
wonderful
but
what
do
it
mean
in
real
term
,
if
I
may
ask
?
they
have
not
actually
be
rehouse
in
some
instance
as
of
yet
.
they
have
not
benefit

-----
I
would
have
close
it
out
at
Mr.
Mitchell
's
last
intervention
,
but
Mr.
Masding
have
come
back
in
.
to
be
quite
frank
about
it
,
I
know
he
must
defend
he
own
realm
but
a
great
injury
be
inflict
upon
people
by
the
entity
before
we
which
we
be
question
today
.
I
ask
what
be
the
lesson
learn
in
order
that
we
can
move
on

that
bring
we
to

what
I
would
like
to
know
be
whether
the
Mason
Hayes
&
Curran
report
be
in
the
public
domain
.
could
that
be
publish
or
make
available
to
this
committee
?
there
be
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
a
process
in
which
Royal
Bank
of
Scotland
provide
€400
million
to
compensate
small
business
customer
.
there
be
a
question
mark
as
to
whether
or
not
,
as
a
result
of
the
GRG
process
,
there
be
business
in
this
state
that
could
be
eligible
for
compensation
among
the
2000
odd
business
we
have
discuss
.
this
committee
will
have
to
explore
this
matter
further
and
it
will
endeavour
to
bring
in
people
whose
business
have
be
directly
affect
by
this
GRG
process
.
do
Mr.
Blair
foresee
that
compensation
will
be
pay
out
to
customer
in
this
State
?
we
should
not
be
pedantic
at
this
stage
,
although
perhaps
Mr.
Blair
be
not
be
deliberately
pedantic
on
this
one
.
have
Mr.
Blair
make
provision
on
the
book
for
compensation
to
small
business
operator
in
this
State
?
do
Mr.
Blair
foresee
make
such
provision
?
I
thank
Mr.
Blair
.
that
be
it
on
GRG
,
but
I
would
like
to
come
back
in
late
.
I
will
lighten
the
load
somewhat
for
Mr.
Mallon
.
I
ask
Mr.
Mallon
to
give
the
perspective
of
Ulster
Bank
and
that
of
its
parent
on
Brexit
from
a
macroeconomic
viewpoint
.
he
speak
about
some
headwind
come
down
the
track
regard
Brexit
.
he
speak
about
Ulster
Bank
's
strategic
position
vis-à
-
vis
the
parent
company
,
which
have
inoculate
it
,
for
want
of
a
good
word
.
this
committee
and
the
House
in
general
be
try
to
get
as
many
perspective
as
possible
on
the
outworking
of
Brexit
.
it
would
be
interesting
to
get
Mr.
Mallon
's
perspective
on
the
significance
of
Brexit
.
I
do
not
necessarily
expect
he
to
go
into
the
political
realm
,
but
there
be
the
permutation
of
the
trigger
of
article
50
and
the
permutation
of
a
hard
Brexit
.
be
Ulster
bank
do
any
forward
planning
for
a
hard
Brexit
or
a
soft
Brexit
with
access
to
the
European
market
?
be
there
significant
variance
on
that
point
?
be
the
witness
go
into
the
Treasury
lobbying
on
issue
like
this
or
make
they
view
know
or
express
concern
along
that
line
in
regard
to
access
to
the
single
Market
and
the
tariff
issue
?
I
thank
the
witness
for
appear
before
the
committee
.
I
wish
to
echo
what
be

I
thank
the
witness
for
attend
.
this
be
quite
a
complex
proposal
.
I
do
not
doubt
there
be
not
a
politician
across
Europe
who
will
have
question
about
the
modality
of
the
commission
's
proposal
.
one
point
the
commission
raise
with
the
committee
concern
the
treatment
of
research
and
development
.
it
state
the
2011
proposal
for
full
deductibility
of
research
and
development
cost
be
a
one
-
off
.
there
be
no
capitalisation
depreciation
of
research
and
development
over
several
year
.
this
regime
have
be
retain
under
the
relaunch
proposal
with
the
exception
of
immovable
property
.
what
be
the
immovable
property
element
?
over
the
past
several
year
,
this
country
have
focus
on
the
knowledge
box
and
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
.
there
be
a
80:20
split
between
the
domestic
and
foreign
direct
investment
sector
.
what
would
be
the
effect
of
the
commission
's
proposal
on
domestic
company
?
scientist
do
not
like
to
be
call
"
white
coat
"
at
all
.
I
appreciate
that
.
the
fear
we
have
in
this
committee
be
that
the
work
Ms
O'Brien
just
describe
in
regard
to
create
the
research
and
development
regime
,
if
one
like
,
in
term
of
attract
foreign
direct
investment
be
undermine
in
any
way
by
virtue
of
the
proposal
people
would
have
serious
issue
with
that
,
while
wish
to
continue
work
with
the
proposal
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
understanding
of
the
arbitrary
figure
of
€750
million
in
relation
to
the
turnover
and
the
common
base
.
there
be
a
80:20
split
between
the
domestic
and
non-domestic
sector
.
my
instinct
tell
I
that
loophole
could
be
create
to
circumvent
that
.
perhaps
I
be
wrong
.
do
Ms
O'Brien
have
a
perspective
on
that
also
?
how
do
one
calculate
the
€
750
million
threshold
?
it
be
conceivable
that
people
might
not
come
up
to
that
base
for
all
sort
of
reason
or
they
could
be
very
creative
in
ensure
that
they
do
not
come
up
to
that
base
so
as
not
to
hit
the
threshold
,
so
to
speak
.
that
be
fair
enough
.
I
ask
just
to
get
a
perspective
and
I
thank
Ms
O’Brien
for
that
.
that
be
all
I
have
to
say
for
now
.
I
appreciate
that
.
there
be
a
long
way
to
go
on
this
proposal
but
it
important
that
we
have
perspective
on
the
tax
implication
for
R&D
in
particular
.
be
other
taxation
institute
across
the
27
or
28
member
state
flag
this
concern
and
be
there
collaboration
between
the
Irish
Tax
Institute
and
other
on
this
bespoke
issue
?
I
appreciate
the
Vice
Chairman
's
invitation
.
I
have
not
yet
get
a
chance
to
ask
Mr.
Coffey
any
question
.
I
will
be
just
a
few
moment
.
I
wish
to
hear
Mr.
Coffey
's
view
on
one
issue
I
zone
in
on
in
he
submission
,
and
perhaps
he
will
have
to
repeat
himself
.
the
document
state
that
the
European
Commission
study
do
not
have
datum
on
sale
by
destination
and
that
in
this
instance
,
rather
than
try
to
impute
the
location
of
sale
,
the
study
proxy
sale
with
output
.
could
Mr.
Coffey
give
we
a
layman
's
view
on
what
he
mean
by
this
,
particularly
for
people
watch
the
proceedings
of
the
meeting
who
be
very
interested
in
this
subject
?
Mr.
Coffey
refer
specifically
to
the
pharma
sector
and
the
€
15
billion
impact
it
have
on
payroll
,
supply
and
so
on
.
he
seem
to
critique
the
proposal
by
the
commission
on
the
basis
that
it
only
use
company
financial
datum
.
I
do
not
want
to
put
word
into
he
mouth
,
but
my
ear
be
tell
I
that
the
commission
's
fundamental
proposal
be
quite
flawed
,
or
at
the
very
minimum
can
be
seriously
critique
,
because
it
do
not
delve
into
the
very
factor
to
which
Mr.
Coffey
refer
.
a
country
such
as
Ireland
have
a
huge
dependence
on
foreign
direct
investment
and
notwithstand
global
tax
justice
,
all
this
be
issue
that
be
sometimes
raise
,
include
the
BEPS
process
under
way
through
the
OECD
.
to
be
fair
,
Ms
O'Brien
be
right
that
we
must
give
that
process
a
fair
wind
and
a
chance
to
settle
.
however
,
there
could
be
serious
permutation
for
Ireland
's
ability
to
continue
to
attract
FDI
and
maintain
it
.
the
pharmaceutical
sector
,
for
instance
,
have
a
regional
importance
in
the
south
,
east
,
west
,
north
and
north
west
.
I
be
not
be
too
parochial
;
it
span
the
whole
country
.
if
I
be
in
the
pharmaceutical
sector
consider
this
proposal
and
if
I
be
a
lead
on
a
site
make
strategic
decision
from
a
corporate
point
of
view
,
I
would
be
potentially
quite
worried
by
this
proposal
as
they
stand
.
Ceteris
paribus
,
as
they
say
in
economic
term
,
if
the
proposal
be
take
as
they
be
present
to
we
and
if
they
be
give
effect
in
law
that
could
have
serious
consequence
for
we
ability
to
maintain
foreign
direct
investment
.
it
could
have
a
big
impact
on
payroll
.
I
thank
the
witness
today
because
if
we
can
parse
or
delve
deep
into
they
submission
and
use
they
as
part
of
we
response
to
the
commission
before
the
20
December
deadline
it
would
be
very
useful
for
this
committee
.
to
conclude
,
it
will
be
costly
and
unpredictable
,
it
will
result
in
a
loss
of
sovereignty
,
it
will
be
difficult
and
complex
to
introduce
and
,
ultimately
,
it
will
put
a
huge
hole
in
the
Exchequer
finances
if
it
be
implement
in
anything
like
the
way
that
be
suggest
.
be
that
a
fair
comment
on
both
side
?
on
that
basis
,
if
no
other
member
be
offer
to
come
in
again
,
I
thank
Ms
Cora
O'Brien
,
Mr.
Aidan
Lucey
and
Mr.
Seamus
Coffey
for
they
open
statement
,
they
contribution
and
they
interaction
with
all
of
the
member

afternoon

I
welcome
the
Commissioner
,
Mr.
Moscovici
,
to
we
committee
.
I
will
start
by
make
a
political
point
.
as
a
former
member
of
Parliament
and
a
former
minister
,
the
Commissioner
will
take
a
reading
from
this
meeting
of
the
Irish
Parliament
's
Joint
Committee
on
Finance
,
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
and
Taoiseach
today
.
the
mood
thus
far
be
one
of
a
degree
of
scepticism
about
this
proposal
because
too
many
question
be
leave
unanswered
on
how
it
will
affect
we
ability
,
for
instance
,
to
attract
foreign
and
direct
investment
.
we
take
the
commissioner
's
intervention
in
good
faith
and
the
proposal
be
that
there
would
be
a
1.2
%
rise
in
growth
across
the
European
Union
and
€
90
billion
in
extra
investment
.
if
we
be
inhabit
a
political
space
in
which
there
be
the
rise
of
the
extreme
right
and
of
populism
,
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
would
say
that
if
there
be
a
proposal
that
seek
to
undermine
sovereignty
or
even
the
perception
of
sovereignty
-
I
note
the
Commissioner
's
colleague
be
nod
she
head
-
and
there
be
a
perception
of
a
diminution
of
Ireland
's
ability
to
maintain
its
sovereignty
as
it
relate
to
taxation
measure
,
I
would
suggest
it
be
ill
-
time
.
the
focus
of
the
commission
's
agenda
or
policy
outcome
should
not
be
to
examine
the
consolidate
tax
base
but
to
examine
the
stability
and
growth
pact
.
if
a
country
like
Ireland
have
the
sword
of
Damocles
in
term
of
Brexit
hand
over
it
,
where
there
be
a
degree
of
uncertainty
and
nobody
can
definitively
answer
question
from
a
macro-economic
point
of
view
on
how
Brexit
will
affect
small
country
like
Ireland
because
the
negotiation
de
facto
have
not
be
conclude
,
and
if
there
be
a
proposal
on
top
of
that
which
create
the
perception
that
Irish
people
's
sovereignty
as
it
relate
to
they
tax
affair
be
undermine
in
any
way
,
then
the
commission
be
add
to
a
degree
of
euroscepticism
,
notwithstand
the
EUROSTAT
poll
number
on
Ireland
's
relationship
with
the
European
Union
.
it
should
be
concentrate
on
matter
such
as
the
stability
and
growth
pact
instead
.
if
we
consider
rule
such
as
the
excessive
deficit
procedure
,
the
balance
budget
rule
and
the
six
pack
,
what
Europe
need
if
we
be
to
have
a
1.2
%
rise
in
growth
be
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
with
respect
to
the
stability
and
growth
pact
as
it
relate
to
country
like
Ireland
,
which
be
currently
very
constrain
and
be
seek
change
to
the
rule
to
ensure
that
it
can
start
make
investment
in
infrastructure
and
the
capital
investment
that
will
add
to
and
fuel
growth
in
the
economy
.
we
be
not
a
eurosceptic
country
.
I
inhabit
the
centre
leave
.
my
group
within
the
European
Parliament
have
put
forward
proposal
for
a
relaxation
of
stability
and
Growth
pact
rule
.
we
want
to
see
growth
happen
.
if
that
of
we
who
champion
the
EU
want
to
see
it
sustain
against
the
rise
euroscepticism
and
increase
populism
that
we
see
,
we
have
to
see
reform
.
I
put
it
to
the
commissioner
that
reform
come
in
allow
for
great
flexibility
with
respect
to
the
stability
and
growth
pact
.
that
be
my
main
point
.
I
hope
that
as
a
former
member
of
Parliament
and
a
former
minister
,
the
commissioner
will
be
able
to
give
we
some
insight
from
that
perspective
.
he
will
have
to
wear
he
commissioner
hat
at
the
same
time
but
I
put
it
to
he
that
growth
in
Europe
be
predicate
on
a
great
relaxation
of
the
stability
and
growth
pact
rule
.
okay
,
because
-----
I
have
only
make
one
or
two
point
.
the
Commissioner
's
answer
be
quite
comprehensive
,
too
.
a
very
senior
politician
in
France
,
the
Commissioner
's
own
country
,
constantly
refer
to
we
tax
base
.
I
will
say
to
the
Commissioner
again
,
despite
the
opposition
there
appear
to
be
to
this
matter
,
there
be
far
more
important
thing
to
focus
on
in
Europe
.
we
can
have
a
conversation
about
it
,
but
I
would
like
to
see
that
issue
be
address
with
the
ordinary
people
,
we
citizen
who
we
represent
,
at
the

all
that

I

on
19
December
we
Department
of
Finance
issue
a
statement
set
out
some
clear
and
unambiguous
view
relate
to
the
ruling
or
interpretation
of
the
commission
.
I
will
quote
from
the
statement
in
the
context
of
the
various
entity
,
include
Apple
Inc.
,
Apple
sale
International
and
Apple
Operation
Europe
.
I
be
try
to
distil
this
for
people
who
may
not
have
technical
knowledge
,
for
example
,
ordinary
citizen
who
be
watch
the
proceedings
.
on
19
December
the
Department
of
Finance
state
that
the
commission
's
decision
:
the
decision
also
mischaracterise
the
activity
and
responsibility
of
the
Irish
branch
of
ASI
and
AOE
.
this
branch
carry
out
routine
function
,
but
all
important
decision
within
ASI
and
AOE
be
make
in
the
USA
,
and
the
profit
derive
from
this
decision
be
not
properly
attributable
to
the
Irish
branch
of
ASI
and
AOE
.
how
do
the
commissioner
respond
to
that
contention
from
we
Department
of
Finance
?
okay
.
in
the
commission
's
contention
,
where
be
the
intellectual
property
generate
?
how
do
the
commissioner
respond
to
the
view
that
Apple
's
intellectual
property
licence
to
the
Irish
branch
of
Apple
Operation
Europe
and
Apple
sale
International
be
not
consistent
with
Irish
law
?
that
be
the
view
of
we
Department
of
Finance
.
I
would
like
to
return
to
the
issue
of
tax
liability
.
the
commission
have
not
be
silent
on
the
question
of
whether
other
member
state
or
other
country
have
a
call
on
the
magical
figure
of
€
13
billion
.
what
be
the
modality
the
commission
be
propose
for
Ireland
to
set
up
a
system
for
other
country
to
come
call
for
that
€
13
billion
or
a
portion
of
it
?
I
would
like
to
examine
the
statement
the
commissioner
make
to
this
effect
-
if
I
understand
she
correctly
-
when
she
say
other
country
might
have
a
call
on
the
€
13
billion
.
I
have
listen
carefully
to
what
she
have
say
as
a
commissioner
of
the
European
Union
about
the
importance
of
the
single
Market
.
my
view
be
that
if
the
commission
be
to
make
such
a
statement
,
it
must
also
have
a
view
on
how
other
member
state
be
to
collect
this
money
,
if
that
be
what
will
transpire
in
the
final
analysis
.
she
be
too
good
for
deputy
Murphy
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
at
the
joint
committee
meeting
she
attend
recently
,
the
Commissioner
state
:
I
can
say
how
it
look
from
my
side
.
we
do
not
investigate
how
Apple
organised
its
operation
.
we
do
not
investigate
the
cost
-
share
agreement
.
we
do
not
investigate
the
fact
that
Apple
record
its
profit
in
Cork
,
Ireland
.
we
be
look
at
whether
the
allocation
of
profit
be
record
in
the
branch
and
whether
,
therefore
,
it
have
to
be
tax
in
Ireland
,
or
record
in
the
stateless
headquarters
and
,
therefore
,
not
to
be
tax
in
Ireland
.
we
find
that
the
recording
by
Apple
,
which
we
do
not
question
,
could
not
be
support
by
economic
activity
.
that
be
why
they
ought
to
be
record
in
the
branch
of
the
company
that
be
taxable
in
Ireland
.
I
be
try
to
reconcile
,
in
my
own
mind
,
the
statement
make
by
the
Department
of
Finance
on
the
Irish
branch
of
Apple
sale
International
and
Apple
Operation
Europe
.
can
the
minister
give
we
a
opinion
on
the
Commissioner
's
statement
,
particularly
on
the
stateless
headquarters
and
the
activity
level
she
say
be
not
support
by
economic
activity
?
the
Commissioner
go
on
to
say
,
"
we
do
not
investigate
or
value
the
intellectual
property
.
"
if
I
interpret
it
correctly
,
in
deal
with
activity
level
in
Ireland
,
they
be
actually
put
a
value
on
the
intellectual
property
,
or
they
be
at
least
state
it
to
be
economic
activity
.
be
I
wrong
in
this
contention
?
the
kernel
of
the
case
will
be
in
tax
sovereignty
for
the
Irish
people
.
the
base
erosion
and
profit
shift
,
BEPS
,
process
speak
to
that
.
I
also
welcome
the
Revenue
commissioner
.
I
be
try
to
distil
this
.
in
respect
of
the
theme
around
the
methodology
,
the
commission
have
state
that
the
decision
of
30
August
assert
that
the
two
opinion
give
in
1991
and
2007
by
Revenue
renounce
tax
revenue
that
Ireland
would
otherwise
have
be
entitle
to
collect
from
the
Irish
branch
of
Apple
sale
International
,
ASI
,
and
Apple
Operation
Europe
,
AOE
.
Mr.
Cody
speak
of
a
mis-characterisation
.
I
think
that
be
the
word
he
use
in
the
document
we
have
.
will
he
explain
what
he
mean
?
what
be
mean
by
"
renounce
"
in
this
instance
?
correct
I
if
my
mathematics
be
wrong
,
if
the
tax
liability
be
€
13
billion
and
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
the
tax
rate
be
10
%
,
the
economic
activity
be
€
130
billion
,
if
I
be
correct
.
what
the
commission
be
say
be
that
in
this
instance
,
there
be
€
130
billion
worth
of
economic
activity
conduct
on
the
island
of
Ireland
through
two
entity
.
be
that
correct
base
on
that
model
?
that
be
what
it
be
say
.
I
return
to
the
Commissioner
's
comment
when
she
appear
before
the
committee
the
other
day
.
she
say
:
we
be
look
at
whether
the
allocation
of
profit
be
record
in
the
branch
and
whether
,
therefore
,
it
have
to
be
tax
in
Ireland
,
or
record
in
the
stateless
headquarters
and
,
therefore
,
not
to
be
tax
in
Ireland
.
we
find
that
the
recording
by
Apple
,
which
we
do
not
question
,
could
not
be
support
by
economic
activity
.
that
be
why
they
ought
to
be
record
in
the
branch
of
the
company
that
be
taxable
in
Ireland
.
she
go
on
to
state
:
we
do
not
investigate
or
value
the
intellectual
property
.
we
have
not
do
that
here
.
we
have
see
that
Apple
have
organised
itself
with
what
it
refer
to
as
a
cost
-
share
agreement
.
this
mean
that
most
of
the
research
and
development
take
place
at
the
Apple
Inc.
facility
in
Cupertino
.
I
be
try
to
get
my
head
around
this
.
in
Mr.
Cody
's
line
of
argument
,
he
state
that
the
commission
's
attribution
of
Apple
's
intellectual
property
licence
to
the
Irish
branch
of
AOE
and
ASI
be
not
consistent
with
Irish
law
and
,
moreover
,
be
inconsistent
with
the
principle
it
claim
to
apply
,
as
be
its
state
refusal
to
take
into
account
the
activity
of
Apple
Inc
.
there
be
no
reconciliation
between
that
two
statement
.
I
be
try
to
distil
the
contradiction
in
layperson
's
term
.
in
respect
of
the
intellectual
property
piece
,
the
minister
ask
we
to
refer
to
the
phone
and
so
on
be
make
in
China
and
the
intellectual
property
in
Cupertino
.
can
somebody
distill
that
for
I
in
bare
simple
term
?
where
do
the
intellectual
property
piece
fit
into
all
this
if
the
commissioner
be
say
that
the
commission
do
not
investigate
or
value
the
intellectual
property
?
Mr.
Cody
be
say
that
the
intellectual
property
be
not
generate
in
Ireland
.
if
I
be
interpret
the
commissioner
correctly
,
she
be
say
that
the
commission
be
not
investigate
the
intellectual
property
so
,
therefore
,
it
be
not
investigate
a
Irish
operation
in
that
sense
.
how
do
we
reconcile
that
?
how
do
we
get
a
good
understanding
of
that
dynamic
?
do
the
two
opinion
of
1991
and
2007
speak
to
the
issue
of
intellectual
property
?
if
I
understand
Mr.
Cody
's
interaction
with
deputy
Michael
McGrath
correctly
,
the
Revenue
commissioner
would
have
kick
the
tyre
on
the
two
opinion
give
.
do
Revenue
look
at
the
issue
of
intellectual
property
in
that
?
I
have
two
very
simple
technical
question
.
what
be
the
arm
's
-
length
principle
?
why
have
the
commission
apply
it
incorrectly
,
in
Mr.
Cody
's
view
?
who
know
?
I
thank
Mr.
Cody
and
he
colleague
for

I
welcome
both
Mr.
Deering
and
Ms
Cassidy
to
the
committee
.
Mr.
Deering
state
that
the
FSO
be
deal
with
400
complaint
on
tracker
mortgage
.
be
that
the
cumulative
number
of
complaint
or
be
there
more
?
I
have
a
figure
of
600
for
tracker
mortgage
specifically
.
be
that
correct
?
if
I
understand
the
figure
correctly
,
the
FSO
have
carry
out
a
review
of
600
complaint
regard
tracker
mortgage
in
2015
.
it
be
quite
a
volume
nonetheless
.
Mr.
Deering
state
that
two
appeal
relate
to
tracker
mortgage
be
list
for
hearing
on
16
February
2015
and
when
they
come
for
mention
,
they
be
withdraw
by
the
bank
.
why
be
they
withdraw
?
do
the
bank
possibly
settle
with
the
complainant
at
that
stage
?
on
the
FSO
's
interaction
with
the
Central
Bank
,
I
will
try
to
go
back
to
what
Mr.
Deering
say
.
the
FSO
state
that
two
of
the
complaint
be
remit
to
it
for
further
consideration
,
while
the
bank
be
unsuccessful
in
the
remain
two
appeal
.
Mr
Deering
state
that
the
FSO
be
wait
for
the
Central
Bank
to
come
back
to
it
.
he
state
:
we
be
currently
deal
with
approximately
400
complaint
relate
to
tracker
mortgage
.
in
the
vast
majority
of
this
,
the
mediation
or
investigation
and
adjudication
of
the
complaint
have
be
put
on
hold
pend
the
outcome
of
the
Central
Bank
examination
statement
here
.
what
be
the
FSO
's
interaction
with
the
Central
Bank
at
present
in
respect
of
this
process
?
how
long
will
it
take
?
be
that
400
case
de
facto
in
limbo
?
presumably
,
that
complainant
be
communicate
with
and
be
fully
au
fait
with
the
process
in
hand
.
how
many
complaint
have
the
FSO
upheld
?
I
be
ask
specifically
about
tracker
mortgage
.
what
percentage
of
the
number
of
complaint
pertain
to
tracker
?
what
be
the
FSO
's
success
rate
?
we
accept
that
.
what
have
be
the
large
payment
of
compensation
make
to
date
?
I
understand
.
it
be
just

one
do
not

to
see
any
case
slip
through
the
crack
,
particularly
someone
of

I
welcome
the
representative
group
and
thank
they
for
they
time
.
I
be
try
to
reconcile
the
gap
between
the
Central
Bank
,
the
Department
of
Finance
and
the
individual
member
of
a
credit
union
,
as
represent
by
this
group
today
.
if
I
start
with
Consultation
Paper
76
-
or
CP76
-
my
understanding
be
that
the
representative
organisation
make
specific
proposal
on
tiered
regulation
.
I
note
the
point
make
by
Mr.
Tim
Molan
of
CUMA
early
:
Tiered
regulation
,
proportionate
to
the
scale
and
risk
in
each
credit
union
,
have
not
be
deliver
.
this
be
a
key
deliverable
of
the
commission
report
.
consultation
and
engagement
have
be
less
consistent
and
transparent
than
be
originally
envisage
…
where
consultation
have
be
trigger
,
sector
view
have
often
be
ignore
,
as
be
the
case
with
CP88
.
I
want
to
drill
further
into
that
dynamic
.
I
read
the
speech
by
the
registrar
of
credit
union
to
the
CUMA
spring
conference
.
objectively
,
one
would
think
that
,
from
a
regulatory
point
of
view
,
the
issue
raise
by
she
in
that
speech
seem
to
apply
to
many
credit
union
.
if
there
be
still
outlier
in
the
system
that
be
not
tick
all
the
regulatory
box
from
a
legislative
point
of
view
,
should
they
be
deal
in
one
parcel
,
while
that
credit
union
,
whether
they
be
large
or
involved
in
the
hub
-
and
-
speak
model
,
be
allow
to
progress
into
area
such
as
payment
account
,
debit
card
,
long
term
lending
and
investment
in
social
housing
?
be
it
the
case
that
the
Central
Bank
be
try
to
apply
a
one
-
size
-
fit
-
all
approach
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
will
that
hamper
the
ability
of
the
credit
union
movement
to
progress
in
lending
for
productive
,
social
and
other
purpose
?
do
that
involve
a
change
to
one
of
the
section
of
the
legislation
or
do
it
involve
a
change
in
the
culture
within
the
Central
Bank
regard
how
it
view
credit
union
?
that
be
a
question
which
should
be
pose
to
the
registrar
as
one
of
the
working
of
this
interaction
when
she
be
before
the
committee
on
Thursday
.
I
read
she
speech
to
the
CUMA
conference
in
which
she
address
issue
such
as
everyday
payment
account
.
she
state
:
[
T
]
he
market
be
not
large
enough
to
support
multiple
offering
of
the
same
product
and
service
,
but
that
limit
be
not
one
confine
to
one
service
model
.
so
far
,
we
have
not
receive
any
formal
application
beyond
MPCAS
,
although
we
sectoral
engagement
suggest
that
this
be
a
area
of
active
interest
.
if
the
credit
union
movement
be
talk
about
innovate
and
the
potential
for
payment
account
,
how
do
that
work
its
way
through
the
system
?
what
do
that
mean
from
the
credit
union
movement
's
perspective
?
Mr.
McCrory
have
move
on
to
agm
.
on
that
issue
,
I
understand
that
quite
a
few
agm
have
not
take
place
and
that
sanction
be
need
for
a
agm
to
take
place
.
why
be
this
the
case
?
I
wish
to
broaden
the
perspective
on
this
issue
with
Mr.
Johnson
,
Mr.
Molan
and
even
Ms
O'Connor
who
should
forgive
I
as
we
have
not
include
she
in
the
interaction
yet
.
we
be
try
to
get
a
good
understanding
of
this
.
as
I
say
,
it
be
still
about
the
gap
that
exist
.
Mr.
McCrory
have
already
articulate
a
gap
in
respect
of
CP88
and
speak
about
the
indefinite
delay
in
the
hold
of
agm
.
what
the
average
member
want
to
know
be
why
this
be
the
case
.
how
do
we
close
this
gap
?
the
theme
of
the
registrar
's
speech
be
"
mind
the
Gap
"
.
she
refer
to
:
-
you
current
v.
you
need
level
of
regulatory
compliance
.
give
some
of
the
issue
we
have
find
in
recent
supervisory
engagement
,
I
could
characterize
this
as
"
mind

and
the
ambitious
propose
or
evolve
business
model
,
which
often
carry
very
much
different
risk
and
capability
.
there
be
then
still
a
massive
gap
between
how
the
registrar
perceive
the
credit
Union
manager
Association
and
how
the
organisation
perceive
itself
.
somewhere
in
between
,
we
be
try
to
see
if
we
can
broker

mediate
that
gap
,
and
in
broad
term
there
seem
to
be
a
long
way
to
go
.
on
the
face
of
it
,
the
registrar
seem
,
if
I
be
read
the
speech
correctly
,
to
put
a
major
limit
on
the
issue
of
the
payment
account

she
seem
to
suggest
a
major
curb

,
for

of
a

,
in

she
be
very
reticent
,
if
I
interpret
she
correctly
-
and
she
will
have
a
chance
to
respond
to
this
comment
on
Thursday
-
on
the
investment
in
social

.
in
addition
,
I
have
a
difficulty
understand
the

again
,
the
question
on
my
mind
be
whether
it
take
a
legislative

to
amend
this
or
whether
a
cultural

I

that

do

anyone
else

Tiered

be
what
be

.
that
be
the
message
we
need
to
hear
in
a
very
unambiguous
way
,
and
it
be
come
across
clearly
.
in
other
word
,
if
there
be
a
outlier
who
do
not
fit

the
criterion

vis
regulation
,
in
a
one
-
tier
system
of
regulation
one
cannot
develop
new
business
model
or
innovate
.
I
think
that
be
the
core
message
we
be
get
from
the
witness
.

Mr.
Carville
describe
credit
union
as
diverse
and
state
they
mode
of
operation
present
challenge
in
that
there
be
283
different
board
and
entity
.
he
also
refer
to
the
need
for
flexibility
and
proportionality
in
policy
and
regulation
to
support
the
credit
union
framework
.
do
this
involve
have
a
process
of
tiered
regulation
and
,
if
so
,
when
will
such
a
process
be
in
place
?
I
ask
Mr.
Carville
to
provide
brief
,
concise
answer
because
I
have
only
a
short
time
to
question
he
.
I
would
prefer
the
view
of
the
Department
of
Finance
.
the
credit
union
representative
organisation
appear
before
the
joint
committee
on
Tuesday
last
.
Tiered
regulation
do
not
appear
to
feature
in
the
model
be
pursue
from
a
policy
perspective
,
that
be
,
by
the
Department
,
or
by
the
Central
Bank
.
accord
to
one
school
of
thought
,
a
rural
credit
union
cannot
be
assess
in
the
same
way
as
a
industrial
credit
union
,
to
use
Mr.
Carville
's
term
,
or
any
other
type
of
sectoral
credit
union
.
member
need
to
find
out
whether
there
will
be
movement
towards
tiered
regulation
.
the
question
require
a
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
answer
.
when
will
it
report
?
I
be
fail
to
grasp
something
here
.
we
all
offer
platitude
on
the
importance
of
the
credit
union
sector
.
how
long
have
the
CUAC
report
be
in
existence
?
time
be
pass
.
we
need
a
definitive
answer
as
to
when
tiered
regulation
will
take
place
.
Mr.
Carville
say
the
implementation
group
be
meet
.
can
we
have
a
expectation
that
it
will
be
in
the
first
,
second
,
third
or
fourth
quarter
in
2017
or
the
first
quarter
in
2018
?
we
need
definitive
timeline
.
the
Department
will
have
oversight
of
that
process
.
this
be
what
I
do
not
understand
.
as
parliamentarian
,
we
be
aware
of
the
restructuring
that
have
take
place
because
it
have
happen
within
we
community
.
however
,
there
be
a
clear
message
on
Tuesday
that
the
regulation
do
not
reflect
the
reality
.
the
witness
say
that
once
the
ReBo
process
be
complete
,
the
tiered
regulation
will
follow
,
if
I
interpret
she
correctly
.
what
do
business
model
development
mean
from
the
Department
's
perspective
?
I
ask
the
witness
to
give
I
definitive
answer
.
what
do
that
mean
?
what
do
that
mean
?
what
be
the
Department
of
Finance
's
position
on
that
,
give
that
there
be
a
clear
programme
for
government
commitment
around
social
housing
and
there
have
be
engagement
with
the
Minister
for
Housing
,
Planning
,
Community
and
local
Government
on
include
the
credit
union
movement
?
why
have
that
not
move
on
?
the
credit
union
representative
tell
we
on
Tuesday
that
they
have
be
go
around
in
circle
.
I
be
sure
the
witness
have
read
what
they
say
.
the
witness
sit
on
the
implementation
committee
and
I
be
try
to
understand
the
position
of
the
Department
of
Finance
.
what
be
its
position
regard
the
potential
of
the
credit
union
movement
,
which
be
sit
on
a
myriad
of
asset
?
many
of
the
credit
union
have
restructure
already
,
so
please
do
not
tell
we
that
there
be
a
further
process
to
be
undertake
.
the
bulk
of
the
large
credit
union
be
sit
on
massive
reserve
and
have
potential
.
they
say
they
be
go
around
in
circle
to
Department
and
the
regulator
but
nothing
be
move
on
this
matter
.
why
be
that
the
case
?
be
it
the
case
that
the
Department
and
the
Central
Bank
be
take
a
view
that
they
do
not
want
the
credit
union
movement
to
move
into
this
space
?
I
hear
word
such
as
"
innovation
"
.
I
be
formerly
a
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
innovation
.
what
do
it
mean
?
what
do
business
model
development
mean
?
many
credit
union
have
move
into
smart
payment
and
so
forth
.
they
be
try
to
innovate
in
the
product
and
service
they
be
provide
,
but
it
appear
that
they
be
constrain
in
do
that
.
I
cannot
understand
why
and
I
be
not
get
answer
here
either
.
the
witness
be
tell
I
that
I
have
to
ask
this
question
of
the
Central
Bank
.
what
be
the
current
state
of
the
€250
million
restructuring
fund
and
the
€
250
million
resolution
fund
?
on
Tuesday
,
the
league
of
credit
union
raise
the
over
-
collection
of
levy
.
how
do
the
witness
respond
to
its
assertion
that
there
be
a
over
-
collection
of
levy
?
if
any
party
refuse
to
implement
any
element
of
the
commission
report
,
will
the
Department
report
that
refusal
to
this
committee
and
to
the
minister
?
I
mean
any
party
that
be
a
party
to
that
,
include
the
Central
Bank
.
do
the
witness
agree
with
the
assertion
that
CUAC
have
identify
element
of
the
commission
report
that
be
outstanding
?
if
he
agree
with
that
assertion
and
if
that
element
of
the
commission
report
that
be
outstanding
have
not
be
implement
,
what
happen
?
Mr.
Carville
be
part
of
the
implementation
team
.
what
will
the
Department
do
if
part
of
the
CUAC
report
be
not
implement
?
that
be
not
a
hypothetical
question
.
this
committee
be
in
something
of
a
vacuum
.
we
want
to
hear
what
the
stakeholder
have
to
say
and
we
want
to
ensure
that
there
be
a
vibrant
credit
union
movement
into
the
future
.
I
be
not
convinced
that
a
sunset
be
be
put
on
action
or
key
deliverable
within
definitive
and
clearly
define
timeline
.
it
seem
from
what
Mr.
Carville
be
say
that
the
Department
be
not
a
million
mile
away
from
understand
the
need
of
the
credit
union
movement
and
realise
the
potential
of
the
movement
.
however
,
there
be
still
a
logjam
.
this
be
why
we
be
try
to
go
hard
on
the
question
here
.
I
suggest
that
tiered
regulation
be
the
nut
that
need
to
be
crack
.
the
impression
I
get
from
the
engagement
of
the
Department
and
the
Central
Bank
with
the
credit
union
movement
be
that
one
of
they
,
or
both
,
do
not
want
to
be
deal
with
283
entity
.
I
think
there
be
a
certain
attitude
that
regard
the
credit
union
as
somehow
amateurish
because
they
be
voluntary
and
non-paid
.
all
credit
union
have
go
through
the
rigour
in
recent
month
.
some
of
they
have
spend
hundred
of
thousand
of
euro
from
member
's
money
on
consultancy
fee
to
meet
the
need
and
requirement
of
the
Central
Bank
and
the
Department
of
Finance
.
they
be
not
see
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
.
they
need
to
see
that
happen
.
that
be
why
I
be
ask
about
clearly
define
timeline
for
the
full
implementation
of
the
CUAC
recommendation
.
we
be
depend
on
the
Department
of
Finance
as
a
stakeholder
in
that
process
.
if
we
do
not
see
progress
in
this
respect
within
clearly
define
timeline
,
that
will
not
bide
well
for
we
confidence
in
the
Department
of
Finance
or
the
Central
Bank
.
I
hope
that
make
sense
.
okay
.
do
the
witness
understand
the
frustration
of
the
credit
union
about
the
lack
of
progress
?
I
thank
Mr.
Carville
.
I
support
what
the
Chairman
say
about
Mr.
Corr
.
in
Mr.
Carville
's
presentation
he
state
that
the
credit
union
policy
within
he
division
be
well
resource
and
be
head
by
Brian
Corr
.
if
the
head
of
the
credit
union
policy
team
cannot
be
here
today
in
this
parliament
and
feel
that
Brussels
be
of
great
importance
that
be
a
bad
day
for
we
interaction
with
the
Department
I
wish
to
support
that
statement
if
I
may
.
at
the
start
of
the
crisis
,
we
be
inform
there
be
a
€
1
billion
hole
in
the
credit
union
.
the
Department
now
inform
we
the
sum
involve
be
€500
million
,
consist
of
€250
million
related
to
restructuring
and
a
further
€
250
million
related
to
resolution
.
of
the
€250
million
provide
for
one
of
this
two
purpose
,
only
€
20
million
be
use
as
bail
-
out
money
.
I
use
that
term
for
the
sake
of
argument
.
this
mean
the
extent
of
the
crisis
in
the
credit
union
movement
be
grossly
exaggerate
.
if
only
€
20
million
of
a
€
250
million
fund
have
be
require
,
the
amount
need
have
be
minuscule
when
compare
with
what
be
need
for
the
bank
.
it
be
certainly
minuscule
relative
to
the
€
1
billion
we
be
inform
would
be
need
for
restructuring
.
the
credit
union
be
now
be
levy
to
generate
funding
for
a
unspecified
purpose
.
it
do
not
seem
to
be
for
any
particular
reason
because
two
separate
fund
,
each
of
€250
million
,
be
already
in
place
.
this
be
akin
to
impose
a
highway
tax
on
the
credit
union
.
will
the
witness
explain
the
reason
for
this
in
simple
language
,
please
?
will
the
credit
union
have
they
money
return
to
they
?
put
another
way
,
will
the
money
be
return
to
we
because
we
be
all
credit
union
customer
?
this
be
taxpayer
's
money
.
there
be
a
restructuring
fund
and
resolution
fund
in
place
.
Mr.
Carville
should
not
try
to
stretch
he
credibility
on
this
issue
.
they
take
the
money
.
may
we
have
a
update
in
the
next
quarter
on
the
work
of
the
implementation
group
?
I
suggest
we
send
a
message
to
the
Department
of
Finance
and
the
Central
Bank
that
the
committee
will
monitor
the
work
of
the
bank
very
closely
on
behalf
of
the
people
we
represent
.
we
need
clear
,
identifiable
timeline
and
deadline
because
progress
have
slip
.
Contrary
to
what
Mr.
Carville
say
,
tiered
regulation
be
define
in
the
original
commission
's
report
.
there
be
to
be
three
process
for
tiered
regulation
.
I
do
not
understand
why
we
have
not
move
from
that
point
to
have
tiered
regulation
under
way
at
this
stage
in
the
first
quarter
of
2017
.
many
credit
union
have
do
the
necessary
hard
graft
and
pay
thousand
of
euro
in
consultancy
fee
to
go
through
the
process
.
the
hub
and
speak
model
be
develop
in
which
the
big
entity
take
on
the
small
one
.
we
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
to
ensure
there
will
be
a
proper
throughput
in
a
clearly
define
timeline
.
how
many
staff
do
Ms
McKiernan
have
in
she
office
?
some
70
staff
.
how
many
people
interface
with
the
individual
credit
union
on
a
daily
basis
?
that
be
35
staff
deal
with
281
credit
union
.
I
thank
Ms
McKiernan
.
that
be
fine
.
how
would
Ms
McKiernan
describe
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
she
staff
and
individual
credit
union
on
a
day
-
to
-
day
basis
?
would
she
describe
it
as
professional
and
courteous
?
be
there
time
when
voice
be
raise
between
she
staff
and
individual
staff
member
of
credit
union
?
have
there
be
occasion
?
go
back
to
the
regulation
-
make
power
,
Ms
McKiernan
speak
about
the
broad
class
of
investment
and
the
upcoming
consultation
.
she
also
refer
to
expectation
in
respect
of
develop
new
business
model
.
during
we
engagement
on
Tuesday
,
we
hear
from
credit
union
that
they
be
undertake
digital
and
social
media
base
marketing
on
a
share
basis
and
that
they
be
generate
new
business
successfully
.
we
have
hear
about
a
share
approach
to
the
mortgage
support
framework
,
notwithstand
the
view
articulate
today
.
my
understanding
be
the
body
do
this
without
necessarily
engage
with
the
Central
Bank
.
how
prescriptive
do
Ms
McKiernan
see
the
bank
's
role
in
the
development
of
new
business
model
?
she
indicate
that
the
bank
have
a
vision
of
a
particular
business
model
start
in
2014
but
which
do
not
progress
in
2017
.
I
be
try
to
gain
a
understanding
of
the
culture
within
the
bank
's
organisation
;
it
be
quite
difficult
to
understand
it
.
she
should
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
but
it
seem
that
if
I
be
to
come
to
the
bank
with
something
I
deem
to
be
progressive
for
a
credit
union
,
it
would
state
it
would
fly
or
it
would
not
.
it
be
a
case
of
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
.
be
I
right
in
discern
that
the
bank
will
not
come
up
with
a
business
model
or
idea
for
how
something
should
progress
?
what
be
the
process
involve
?
be
it
iterative
or
interactive
?
do
the
bank
engage
positively
?
it
seem
that
if
a
idea
do
not
fly
,
that
be
it
and
a
credit
union
must
go
back
to
the
draw
board
.
I
want
to
understand
the
Central
Bank
's
power
in
develop
new
business
model
and
how
deep
be
the
engagement
.
how
prescriptive
be
the
bank
in
develop
new
business
model
?
as
I
have
a
short
amount
of
time
,
can
we
keep
the
answer
short
,
if
that
be
okay
?
if
I
be
to
come
to
the
Central
Bank
with
a
proposal
,
it
would
kick
the
tyre
,
but
it
might
not
necessarily
come
back
to
I
say
it
could
be
tinker
with
here
or
there
.
its
role
,
remit
and
power
be
very
clear
when
it
come
to
new
proposal
.
I
appreciate
that
.
the
delegate
have
indicate
that
standard
of
regulatory
compliance
be
still
well
below
that
require
to
credibly
safeguard
member
's
fund
and
position
credit
union
to
tackle
business
model
development
.
they
be
still
see
a
unacceptable
number
of
credit
union
fail
to
display
a
strategic
understanding
and
good
governance
.
in
several
case
we
have
encounter
limited
financial
skill
set
and
weak
management
.
there
be
281
credit
union
within
the
Central
Bank
's
remit
,
but
how
many
be
still
weak
in
term
of
have
limited
financial
skill
and
weak
management
.
I
would
like
a
specific
number
.
that
be
say
in
a
early
intervention
,
but
I
need
number
.
be
there
"
several
"
outlier
?
do
they
amount
to
a
very
small
minority
,
less
than
10
or
20
of
the
281
credit
union
?
one
could
easily
create
the
impression
that
this
refer
to
the
majority
rather
than
be
the
exception
.
I
need
to
have
a
understanding
of
how
many
be
still
behind
the
door
in
get
they
governance
procedure
correct
.
we
all
understand
credit
union
go
through
a
very
difficult
restructuring
process
.
the
hub
and
speak
model
be
develop
and
it
be
probably
a
iterative
and
ongoing
process
.
they
spend
thousand
of
euro
on
consultant
fee
.
would
Ms
McKiernan
agree
that
many
credit
union
have
come
through
that
process
?
indeed
,
but
I
be
try
to
understand
how
many
still
have
a
way
to
go
in
ensure
risk
management
,
compliance
and
internal
audit
function
be
robust
.
if
the
number
be
at
the
"
high
end
"
,
Ms
McKiernan
should
have
a
figure
in
she
mind
.
what
be
the
number
today
,
23
March
?
Ms
McKiernan
have
already
say
that
three
time
and
do
not
need
to
repeat
the
point
.
I
want
to
come
to
the
issue
of
tiered
regulation
.
we
be
be
tell
that
there
be
no
tiered
regulation
,
but
if
I
understand
the
language
use
by
Ms
McKiernan
today
,
she
be
tell
we
in
couch
term
-
she
can
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
-
that
there
be
tiered
regulation
in
everything
but
name
.
be
that
correct
?
let
we
not
couch
we
language
.
as
politician
,
we
be
use
to
couch
language
.
be
Ms
McKiernan
say
there
be
de
facto
tiering
?
Ms
McKiernan
have
indicate
that
the
bank
have
see
"
no
investigation
of
short
-
term
or
medium
-
term
lending
proposal
.
"
when
do
it
become
necessary
for
a
credit
union
to
obtain
the
registrar
's
permission
for
such
proposal
?
Ms
McKiernan
have
also
state
the
Central
Bank
have
undertake
to
publish
enhance
guidance
on
what
it
expect
to
see
in
term
of
long
-
term
proposal
.
be
the
guideline
inadequate
or
fit
for
purpose
?
in
respect
of
sectoral
leadership
,
if
I
be
read
that
as
a
CUDA
,
CUMA
or
ILCU
member
and
if
Ms
McKiernan
be
tell
I
that
there
be
a
need
,
in
she
own
word
,
for
great
sectoral
leadership
and
a
full
understanding
of
risk
involve
to
develop
a
roadmap
of
business
model
development
,
I
might
take
issue
with
that
.
in
respect
of
we
interaction
with
the
sector
on
Tuesday
,
there
be
consistency
in
its
approach
with
no
outlier
.
CUMA
,
CUDA
and
ILCU
be
represent
.
they
would
argue
that
they
be
show
leadership
and
that
they
be
more
than
willing
to
engage
.
the
Chairman
have
use
the
merry
-
go
-
round
analogy
.
they
have
be
on
the
merry
-
go
-
round
with
the
Department
of
Finance
and
they
contend
with
the
Central
Bank
as
well
to
show
the
type
of
leadership
and
develop
the
innovation
and
business
model
Ms
McKiernan
be
speak
about
here
,
but
there
still
seem
to
be
a
resistance
to
that
.
it
would
be
my
contention
that
by
any
objective
analysis
,
they
have
show
leadership
because
they
have
go
through
the
rigour
of
restructuring
and
,
with
some
outlier
,
have
adhere
to
the
restructuring
process
as
regulate
by
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
.
to
use
Ms
McKiernan
's
language
,
they
now
want
to
move
into
that
multi-step
of
develop
the
sector
again
,
grow
the
business
model
and
encourage
new
lending
with
a
young
demographic
of
borrower
.
it
seem
that
neither
they
nor
Ms
McKiernan
be
a
million
mile
apart
but
there
be
something
within
the
chasm
and
vacuum
that
need
to
be
unblock
.
I
do
not
know
if
it
be
a
issue
of
perception
regard
how
the
Central
Bank
perceive
the
sector
and
how
the
sector
perceive
the
Central
Bank
.
somebody
need
to
do
a
bit
of
mediation
because
if
I
listen
to
Ms
McKiernan
and
the
intervention
of
the
representative
body
,
I
can
see
that
they
all
want
to
go
in
the
same
direction
but
there
be
some
blockage
in
the
way
that
need
to
be
work
through
because
they
have
already
go
through
the
rigour
of
the
regulatory
process
.
I
know
Ms
McKiernan
be
not
pay
lip
service
to
the
idea
of
recognise
the
importance
of
the
sector
,
but
there
be
some
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
Central
Bank
to
ensure
the
sector
progress
back
into
productive
lending
soon
rather
than
late
because
this
have
be
go
on
too
long
.
the
credit
Union
Advisory
Committee
report
have
be
in
existence
for
a
while
and
the
implementation
group
only
meet
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
so
we
need
to
see
progress
by
the
second
or
third
quarter
because
we
have
already
tell
the
Department
of
Finance
that
we
want
it
to
appear
again
before
this
committee
.
I
hope
the
Central
Bank
would
appear
before
the
committee
as
soon
as
possible
to
see
what
progress
be
be
make
on
this
issue
.
not
all
281
common
bond
credit
union
will
come
to
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
with
a
set
of
proposal
.
they
will
work
they
way
up
through
they
representative
organisation
.
I
presume
the
articulation
of
development
of
new
business
will
be
do
primarily
through
the
representative
body
,
with
which
Ms
McKiernan
engage
regularly
.
if
I
understand
it
correctly
,
in
a
nutshell
,
Ms
McKiernan
be
tell
I
that
more
work
need
to
be
do
on
the
business
model
development
piece
.

I
,
too
,
welcome
the
Governor
and
he
colleague
here
today
.
I
want
to
focus
on
the
tracker
mortgage
issue
.
the
update
of
the
Central
Bank
of
Ireland
's
Examination
of
Tracker
Mortgage
-
related
issue
2017
paper
be
quite
comprehensive
and
assist
we
in
get
a
deep
understanding
of
where
the
Central
Bank
be
in
term
of
examine
this
issue
.
however
,
where
individual
make
complaint
to
the
Financial
Service
Ombudsman
and
receive
a
negative
decision
,
I
be
fearful
that
the
Central
Bank
's
examination
will
not
adequately
cover
all
the
people
concerned
.
I
say
this
because
I
have
evidence
particularly
about
PTSB
.
I
will
refer
specifically
to
PTSB
because
the
Central
Bank
state
in
its
report
that
it
have
commence
enforcement
investigation
against
the
bank
.
I
know
of
sample
of
case
where
the
FSO
make
a
negative
decision
about
complaint
and
the
people
concerned
have
not
receive
notification
that
they
case
be
be
examine
,
neither
from
the
bank
nor
the
Central
Bank
.
will
the
governor
give
guarantee
or
assurance
to
that
people
that
they
will
receive
letter
?
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
the
Financial
Service
Ombudsman
be
very
proactive
on
this
issue
and
have
engage
with
we
on
this
.
I
want
to
look
at
one
of
the
thematic
area
,
namely
,
datum
protection
.
this
should
be
apparent
to
the
Central
Bank
at
this
stage
but
I
want
to
get
the
bank
's
assessment
of
this
.
in
the
bank
's
examination
to
date
,
have
it
find
that
there
be
glaring
gap
in
how
datum
protection
law
be
apply
to
individual
customer
when
they
seek
information
on
specific
telephone
call
,
date
of
engagement
or
correspondence
they
have
?
I
understand
that
when
complaint
be
make
or
when
people
seek
to
interact
with
they
bank
,
especially
on
the
option
issue
,
and
again
I
be
talk
about
PTSB
,
there
be
glaring
inaccuracy
in
some
instance
in
how
the
bank
interpret
that
engagement
.
also
,
the
bank
refuse
in
some
instance
to
acknowledge
that
telephone
call
have
take
place
or
that
particular
correspondence
be
enter
into
.
when
people
seek
to
have
record
furnish
,
they
be
not
furnish
or
,
if
they
be
,
they
might
have
be
furnish
inaccurately
or
less
than
adequately
.
I
want
to
ensure
that
from
a
consumer
protection
point
of
view
into
the
future
,
where
people
have
issue
with
they
mortgage
,
a
robust
system
be
in
place
to
ensure
the
datum
protection
element
provide
protection
to
the
consumer
.
I
hope
the
Central
Bank
will
address
that
matter
.
when
look
at
this
matter
,
one
's
instinct
be
to
think
that
there
should
be
a
robust
consumer
protection
entity
that
be
separate
from
the
Central
Bank
.
in
other
word
,
it
should
be
decouple
because
there
be
a
resource
issue
.
if
it
be
necessary
to
examine
2
million
account
,
presumably
microscopically
,
that
give
rise
to
question
as
to
whether
there
should
be
a
separate
entity
to
speak
for
the
consumer
in
this
instance
.
Professor
Lane
will
understand
if
there
be
a
certain
degree
of
scepticism
in
respect
of
the
idea
that
the
bank
appoint
they
own
independent
adviser
to
oversee
the
conduct
of
the
investigation
and
then
liaise
with
the
Central
Bank
in
the
process
.
for
all
sort
of
historical
reason
,
he
will
understand
that
there
would
be
some
scepticism
about
whether
the
Central
Bank
can
adequately
and
robustly
protect
the
consumer
.
on
the
issue
of
criminal
prosecution
,
to
which
reference
be
make
in
the
comprehensive
review
to
which
I
refer
early
,
there
be
specific
power
in
respect
of
the
bank
's
obligation
under
section
33
ak
of
the
Central
Bank
Act
1942
.
have
the
bank
refer
or
report
to
the
Garda
any
aspect
of
its
examination
of
tracker
mortgage
?
finally
,
to
close
the
loop
,
while
the
Central
Bank
state
that
all
mortgage
be
be
examine
,
I
seek
reassurance
that
that
who
have
not
receive
correspondence
who
be
the
subject
of
FSO
complaint
and
who
receive
negative
decision
will
not
be
outlier
.
essentially
,
I
be
ask
for
that
assurance
because
we
do
not
want
to
come
back
to
this
again
in
the
future
when
another
raft
of
borrower
who
have
potentially
be
forget
about
will
have
a
legitimate
case
to
be
hear
.

I
wish
to
question
Mr.
Sunderland
on
he
submission
.
if
I
be
read
between
the
line
correctly
,
there
be
a
sense
that
there
be
a
great
deal
more
work
to
be
do
on
the
Bill
before
the
Office
of
the
data
Commissioner
be
satisfied
that
it
pass
muster
.
be
Mr.
Sunderland
confident
that
the
issue
he
flag
be
be
deal
with
at
present
?
if
so
,
how
and
what
be
the
level
of
engagement
around
the
issue
he
be
talk
about
?
in
the
course
of
he
address
Mr.
Sunderland
state
,
"
it
be
we
understanding
that
the
Bill
be
not
intend
to
provide
a
legal
basis
for
large
structural
government
project
which
would
still
need
specific
primary
legislation
provision
for
any
datum
-
share
that
would
be
require
"
.
will
he
elaborate
on
this
?
he
also
state
,
"
we
would
also
expect
to
see
significantly
more
detail
to
provide
clarity
in
term
of
how
the
governance
...
and
security
arrangement
...
be
to
be
deal
with
"
.
will
he
also
elaborate
on
this
and
give
we
a
sense
of
where
or
how
he
concern
or
flag
issue
be
be
deal
with
?
be
Mr.
Sunderland
get
traction
for
that
argument
?
it
be
interesting
that
Mr.
Sunderland
have
articulate
this
point
.
I
speak
from
the
research
perspective
and
specifically
in
the
health
space
to
which
Mr.
Sunderland
refer
.
I
be
go
a
little
bit
off
kilter
and
be
not
speak
directly
to
the
legislation
here
,
but
I
be
a
great
believer
in
the
idea
that
if
we
be
talk
about
longitudinal
study
and
anonymise
datum
and
so
on
,
there
be
a
mine
of
information
that
could
be
use
effectively
for
positive
societal
outcome
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
health
.
I
be
try
to
understand
at
present
if
there
be
a
move
or
a
initiative
that
would
allow
for
that
.
we
have
the
unique
patient
identifier
but
be
there
a
mechanism
that
we
can
drive
in
a
country
that
be
open
and
have
a
very
strong
research
infrastructure
,
where
we
can
begin
to
look
at
datum
and
analyse
it
and
drive
positive
outcome
?
I
appreciate
that
.
the
Bill
provide
for
what
Mr.
Sunderland
describe
as
a
unambiguous
legal
basis
for
datum
share
between
public
body
.
can
any
of
the
three
witness
articulate
exactly
what
be
mean
by
that
?
what
be
the
underpin
condition
for
a
unambiguous
legal
basis
?
I
have
not
yet
read
the
legislation
as
we
have
not
have
sight
of
it
.
I
be
take
that
on
trust
.
I
presume
that
in
order
to
derive
a
unambiguous
legal
basis
,
one
will
have
to
be
very
prescriptive
as
to
how
that
be
do
.
in
other
word
,
he
will
be
kick
the
tyre
to
ensure
the
consumer
,
whose
datum
be
be
use
,
will
have
the
requisite
protection
build
in
.
therefore
,
the
underpin
will
be
in
the
statutory
instrument
,
if
I
understand
Mr.
Sunderland
correctly
.
not
necessarily
.
Mr.
Sunderland
should
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
.
when
Mr.
Sunderland
speak
about
the
statutory
instrument
,
will
he
articulate
in
simple
language
what
it
mean
for
each
public
body
?
to
be
honest
,
I
be
unclear
in
my
mind
.
where
do
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
and
Mr.
Lowry
stand
on
that
issue
?
if
I
be
read
Mr.
Carroll
's
intervention
in
a
particular
way
,
there
be
perhaps
a
suggestion
that
there
be
already
robust
legal
mechanism
in
place
.
from
we
perspective
as
the
tribune
of
the
people
,
we
want
to
ensure
-
as
do
Mr.
Carroll
,
I
be
sure
-
that
the
individual
consumer
,
citizen
or
client
will
have
the
protection
that
be
vital
and
that
there
will
be
a
strong
legal
basis
underpin
they
.
it
seem
,
therefore
,
that
there
be
still
a
little
bit
of
work
to
be
do
in
underpin
the
robustness
of
the
legislation
to
protect
the
consumer
,
which
be
fair
enough
.
this
meeting
have
be
useful
for
I
personally
in
understand
the
dynamic
.
I
want
to
ask
one
last
question
about
complaint
that
might
be
make
a
consumer
,
client
or
citizen
.
what
protection
be
build
in
?
Mr.
Lowry
might
wish
to
answer
that
question
.
I

too
nosy
.
I
thank
the
delegate
for
they
attendance
.
I
be
sorry
that
I
miss
the
presentation
,
but
I
be
attend
a
conference
on
how
to
make
presentation
to
various
Oireachtas
committee
.
I
will
not
delay
the
delegate
any
long
.
I
would
like
to
see
the
application
of
common
sense
and
experience
in
this
country
in
how
legislation
be
construct
.
I
would
not
necessarily
be
lead
by
the
European
Union
which
be
too
nosy
.
I
thank
the
delegate
for
they
attendance
.
I
be
sorry
that
I
miss
the
presentation
,
but
I
be
attend
a
conference
on
how
to
make
presentation
to
various
Oireachtas
committee
.
they
be
very
industrious
up
around
the
Border
.
thus
far
this
have
be
a
very
useful
exercise
for
we
in
term
of
the
degree
of
enlightenment
on
the
dynamic
at
play
vis
-à
-
vis
the
custom
union
,
tariff
,
the
tax
code
and
so
on
.
however
,
we
need
to
look
at
the
matter
in
the
context
of
the
ongoing
political
discussion
which
be
a
iterative
process
,
notwithstand
the
rhetoric
and
the
fact
that
there
be
a
general
election
under
way
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
this
be
a
very
useful
exercise
for
we
,
particularly
in
glean
the
level
of
readiness
of
individual
business
or
sector
for
Brexit
.
follow
on
from
the
submission
make
by
Mr.
Keegan
and
Ms
Lynch
,
it
appear
that
the
level
of
readiness
be
poor
.
Ms
Lynch
have
say
4
%
of
Irish
company
have
seek
external
advice
and
support
in
meet
the
implication
of
Brexit
and
that
only
one
in
20
firm
have
a
plan
in
place
to
deal
with
a
potential
custom
border
with
the
North
follow
Brexit
.
be
it
possible
for
business
to
do
more
?
we
do
not
yet
know
what
the
final
outcome
of
the
political
negotiation
will
be
and
so
there
be
all
sort
of
scenario
in
that
regard
.
for
example
,
there
could
be
a
hard
Brexit
,
for
which
every
business
have
to
prepare
,
but
we
could
also
have
a
political
solution
,
comprise
outcome
of
a
less
degree
,
include
European
economic
area
status
and
so
on
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
of
what
business
need
to
do
to
be
more
ready
.
be
there
more
state
organisation
such
as
Enterprise
Ireland
,
IDA
Ireland
,
Revenue
,
Department
and
local
enterprise
office
,
leo
,
could
do
?
in
other
word
,
be
there
more
that
need
to
be
do
from
the
State
's
point
of
view
to
assist
business
to
be
ready
for
what
be
inevitable
?
in
essence
,
if
company
be
trade
into
the
Unite
Kingdom
,
they
will
have
to
go
through
a
mindset
change
,
a
psychological
shift
.
they
will
have
to
consider
the
United
Kingdom
as
a
third
country
.
I
want
to
look
at
the
challenge
and
opportunity
.
on
the
point
that
only
4
%
of
Irish
company
have
seek
external
advice
,
what
methodology
be
use
to
glean
that
information
?
what
be
the
survey
range
and
so
on
?
can
Ms
Lynch
give
I
a
sense
of
the
sector
in
which
the
company
in
question
be
operate
?
I
be
just
try
to
understand
the
online
shopping
dynamic
.
Mr.
Cody
refer
to
the
postman
come
to
the
door
.
again
,
be
we
talk
in
theoretical
term
pend
the
outcome
of
a
final
political
negotiation
?
until
that
be
determine
,
the
position
be
effectively
the
status
quo
.
I
will
put
it
another
way
.
read
between
the
line
of
the
Revenue
commissioner
's
submission
,
I
believe
it
provide
we
with
some
sort
of
framework
of
understanding
regard
the
challenge
that
present
themselves
.
however
,
the
Revenue
commissioner
's
planning
,
as
Mr.
Cody
say
,
"
be
base
on
the
full
range
of
possibility
,
include
the
possibility
that
custom
control
or
process
will
apply
between
Ireland
and
the
UK
"
.
have
Mr.
Cody
give
we
a
insight
into
the
full
range
of
possibility
right
down
to
the
individual
consumer
?
be
the
Revenue
commissioner
scenario-
plan
for
the
individual
consumer
,
to
go
back
to
the
postman
knock
at
the
door
,
right
up
to
the
multinational
company
?
that
be
what
we
want
to
get
a
sense
of
from
today
's
engagement
.
however
,
a
transitional
arrangement
would
presumably
be
put
in
place
post
-2019
,
would
it
not
?
I
just
wish
to
be
clear
about
that
.
if
I
,
for
instance
,
have
a
eBay
shop
and
be
a
online
trader
operate
out
of
Cork
,
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
or
anywhere
else
in
Ireland
,
do
Mr.
Cody
anticipate
that
I
would
have
to
get
authorise
economic
operator
,
AEO
,
status
,
or
be
I
misunderstanding
the
mechanism
by
which
aeo
operate
?
Mr.
Cody
say
there
will
have
to
be
a
increase
in
the
number
of
AEOs
.
would
I
be
subject
to
this
?
more
and
more
business
be
move
online
now
.
perhaps
I
be
misunderstanding
the
nature
of
AEOs
.
do
Mr.
Keegan
have
a
perspective
on
this
?
I

I
welcome
the
three
speaker
.
it
have
be
quite
informative
and
it
be
interesting
to
get
they
perspective
.
I
will
start
with
the
political
-
economic
element
of
this
.
I
want
to
kick
the
tyre
a
little
bit
.
I
do
not
think
it
follow
that
the
direction
of
travel
will
be
close
to
European
integration
.
the
Franco
-
German
alliance
have
be
quite
strong
since
the
end
of
the
second
World
War
.
it
may
have
be
under
threat
but
the
election
of
Macron
have
settle
it
.
I
agree
with
deputy
Michael
McGrath
on
the
veto
.
the
veto
still
exist
and
there
be
very
clear
,
unambiguous
messaging
about
Ireland
's
position
on
the
veto
.
there
be
other
small
country
that
potentially
have
similar
position
to
ours
.
it
be
not
just
one
country
on
the
western
periphery
set
its
face
against
the
26
.
there
will
be
other
country
as
well
.
the
dutch
,
the
Danes
and
other
might
be
in
a
similar
position
to
we
.
I
want
to
get
the
witness
's
perspective
on
it
briefly
because
it
be
5.04
p.m
.
we
have
until
5.30
p.m.
but
deputy
Tóibín
want
to
get
in
as
well
.
the
briefer
the
answer
,
the
more
we
can
get
through
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
of
the
BEPS
and
OECD
process
.
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
,
it
be
a
transparent
,
open
and
clear
process
we
have
subscribe
to
as
a
country
.
will
the
witness
discuss
it
?
this
be
dead
in
the
water
.
what
be
the
position
if
there
be
no
political
willingness
,
unanimity
or
treaty
change
any
time
soon
?
my
opinion
be
woe
betide
any
nation
that
try
to
propose
a
referendum
on
any
change
to
the
CCCTB
or
any
matter
of
tax
competency
in
the
EU
treaty
.
it
would
find
it
quite
difficult
.
I
will
park
it
for
a
second
.
I
just
want
to
make
the
point
that
I
do
not
think
the
so
-
call
new
paradigm
be
necessarily
a
new
paradigm
.
the
Irish
position
be
unambiguous
.
it
depend
on
who
be
in
government
at
a
particular
point
in
time
.
we
will
not
be
presumptuous
.
I
want
to
talk
about
prudential
supervision
.
do
Mr.
Pat
Lardner
or
Mr.
Marc
Coleman
know
how
many
new
authorisation
have
be
grant
by
the
Central
Bank
across
financial
service
in
the
past
six
or
12
month
?
be
that
as
a
result
of
the
IDA
strategy
of
go
out
and
win
the
business
or
because
of
corporate
decision
?
do
we
know
how
many
change
there
have
be
to
exist
operation
in
term
of
new
authorisation
?
there
be
a
authorisation
for
a
very
specific
activity
.
if
one
want
to
change
that
activity
they
have
to
seek
a
change
to
the
authorisation
.
I
be
aware
of
that
but
I
just
want
to
get
a
perspective
from
the
guy
who
be
at
the
coalface
of
the
industry
.
I
be
ask
because
if
the
authorisation
be
change
it
could
change
the
type
of
activity
.
it
could
have
a
impact
on
the
type
of
job
whether
they
be
front
of
house
or
back
office
.
in
fairness
to
Mr.
Coleman
,
he
refer
to
FinTech
early
.
that
have
the
potential
to
be
a
game
-
changer
around
how
business
be
done
.
this
lead
I
then
to
seek
a
perspective
from
the
witness
on
the
existence
of
the
European
supervisory
authority
,
the
single
Supervisory
mechanism
for
instance
.
if
a
company
in
the
UK
be
think
of
move
outside
of
the
City
of
London
for
instance
,
and
I
do
not
confine
that
to
a
geographical
space
but
rather
the
City
of
London
as
we
know
it
,
and
be
think
of
move
to
Dublin
,
it
presumably
still
have
to
subscribe
to
that
rule
and
adhere
to
that
two
regulatory
mechanism
.
I
put
it
to
the
witness
that
the
decision
to
locate
in
Dublin
be
a
marginal
call
.
it
be
a
competition
between
Dublin
,
Paris
,
anywhere
in
Switzerland
or
effectively
anywhere
across
Europe
.
the
decision
to
move
to
Ireland
may
not
necessarily
be
predicate
only
on
the
skill
-
set
.
I
have
work
in
banking
myself
and
anyone
smart
can
be
train
within
a
short
eight
-
week
window
.
there
be
not
necessarily
a
need
for
a
long
apprenticeship
;
anybody
can
be
train
in
any
country
with
the
right
type
of
approach
.
my
point
be
that
the
call
to
move
to
Dublin
could
be
predicate
on
quality
of
life
indicator
as
much
as
regulatory
or
prudential
supervisory
one
.
there
be
no
certainty
about
this
whatsoever
,
we
be
still
in
a
nebulous
space
because
the
political
negotiation
be
nowhere
near
get
down
into
the
nitty
-
gritty
yet
.
if
we
be
talk
about
win
job
post
-
Brexit
,
however
,
the
decision
to
move
to
Dublin
would
not
necessarily
be
predicate
on
the
financial
culture
but
more
on
the
follow
question
:
can
my
employee
live
,
work
and
exist
in
this
city
?
that
be
as
much
a
decision
on
the
call
to
move
here
as
anything
else
.
I
be
conscious
of
time
so-----
be
deliberately
parochial
here
,
I
suggest
to
Dr.
Regan
that
a
IDA
Ireland
strategy
for
that
kind
of
win
do
not
have
to
be
cent
on
Dublin
.
it
can
be
cent
on
Limerick
or
Cork
if
we
be
talk
about
quality
of
life
indicator
,
because
the
technology
allow
for
it
now
.
I
will
be
brief
,
as
I
be
under
time
constraint
,
so
I
apologise
in
advance
.
I
welcome
the
submission
.
be
we
seek
the
Central
Bank
's
state
of
play
in
the
context
of
what
be
still
arguably
a
nebulous
process
in
term
of
the
politics
of
Brexit
and
the
negotiation
therein
,
this
would
be
a
good
one
.
I
will
ask
a
simple
question
to
seek
a
good
understanding
of
the
nature
of
authorisation
.
Mr.
Sibley
refer
to
"
currently
authorise
firm
that
be
consider
change
to
exist
operation
and
that
that
be
consider
seek
entirely
new
authorisation
"
.
will
he
give
we
a
brief
sense
of
what
that
mean
in
real
term
?
what
type
of
change
to
that
authorisation
and
new
authorisation
be
be
discuss
?
will
he
break
they
down
by
sector
?
do
they
relate
to
bank
,
fund
manager
,
financial
service
and
so
on
?
that
make
sense
.

I
would
like
to
return
to
the
tracker
mortgage
issue
.
under
the
Central

review
,
as
I
understand
it
,
where
customer
make

where
that
complaint
be
actually
upheld
in

the

become
part
of
this
review
.
even
where
the
FSO
find
against
the
customer
,
that
customer
be
still
to
be
contact
.
I
listen
carefully
to
Mr.
Mitchell
's
description
of
try
and
fail
to
contact
certain
customer
,
but
be
permanent
TSB
satisfied
that
it
have
contact
all
customer
?
I
ask
that
question
because
I
have
a
specific
case
that
could
be
representative
of
a
sample
of
case
where
the
individual
have
not
be
contact
at
all
.
this
individual
be
still
at
the
same
address
as
before
and
continue
to
be
a
permanent
tsb
customer
.
I
worry
that
perhaps
not
everybody
have
be
include
in
this
investigation
.
that
be
interesting
.
what
do
Mr.
Mitchell
mean
when
he
say
that
they
"
be
in
the
process
of
be
contact
"
?
that
suggest
to
I
that
not
everybody
have
be
contact
.
forgive
I
,
I
do
not
want
to
be
too
pedantic
but
I
just
want
to
really
understand
this
.
the
very
specific
case
that
I
have
be
the
subject
of
a
FSO
complaint
.
the
individual
in
question
should
prima
facie
have
be
contact
but
have
not
be
.
could
I
correspond
with
the
bank
with
regard
to
this
specific
case
?
I
be
worried
that
it
could
perhaps
represent
a
sample
of
case
.
that
be
my
central
point
here
.
be
Mr.
Masding
satisfied
that
permanent
TSB
be
fulfil
its
legal
obligation
under
datum
protection
law
?
let
I
be
more
specific
.
I
assume
the
witness
be
aware
that
bank
be
legally
oblige
to
retain
all
communication
for
six
year
after
the
ending
of
a
product
.
a
30
-
year
mortgage
,
for
example
,
would
result
in
a
bank
retain
record
for
36
year
.
be
Mr.
Masding
satisfied
that
permanent
TSB
be
retain
all
of
that
record
with
regard
to
correspondence
with
the
customer
,
even
where
the
customer
make
a
complaint
?
this
might
include
phone
record
,
email
or
any
kind
of
electronic
communication
with
that
customer
.
the
witness
acknowledge
,
then
,
that
there
be
a
lapse
.
how
systemic
be
that
lapse
and
how
many
customer
be
affect
by
it
?
I
ask
the
witness
to
be
specific
.
absolutely
.
again
,
one
suspect
that
this
be
symptomatic
.
it
go
back
to
the
tracker
mortgage
issue
where
complaint
where
make
to
the
FSO
,
where
somebody
seek
record
and
be
unable
to
obtain
they
from
permanent
TSB
.
this
weaken
that
individual
's
case
and
,
indeed
,
rights
.
the
bank
be
clearly
in
breach
of
the
legislation
in
not
retain
fully
the
record
as
per
its
obligation
.
the
witness
have
acknowledge
that
in
one
case
,
but
I
would
suggest
,
as
with
the
one
case
I
be
refer
to
,
there
be
probably
more
than
one
.
the
bank
have
acknowledge
it
will
gladly
accept
correspondence
from
I
relate
to
that
,
if
I
understand
the
witness
correctly
.
I
put
it
to
the
witness
that
the
datum
protection
law
be
the
one
protection
the
customer
have
when
it
hit
the
fan
.
if
institution
such
as
permanent
TSB
do
not
protect
customer
's
rights
in
that
respect
,
it
be
a
serious
fail
.
how
often
do
the
bank
correspond
with
or
meet
the
regulatory
authority
regard
its
obligation
under
the
data
Protection
Act
?
if
the
person
to
whom
I
be
refer
request
they
record
tomorrow
,
can
they
be
satisfied
that
that
record
be
retain
?
pretend
I
be
a
ordinary
customer
.
can
every
customer
be
satisfied
that
they
record

I
thank
the
three
witness
for
they
very
comprehensive
opening
statement
.
I
also
thank
deputy
Michael
McGrath
for
bring
the
Bill
forward
,
which
the
Labour
Party
will
be
support
.
I
hail
from
the
town
of
Mallow
.
it
would
not
be
fair
to
say
that
I
be
bear
in
the
flood
but
I
be
certainly
baptise
in
the
flood
.
I
live
less
than
100
pace
from
the
River
Blackwater
.
if
I
throw
a
stone
from
my
house
,
it
would
pretty
much
land
in
the
Blackwater
.
I
have
first
-
hand
experience
of
flooding
incidence
on
the
Munster
Blackwater
and
I
know
that
the
scheme
that
have
be
put
in
place
in
Mallow
and
Fermoy
demonstrably
work
.
there
be
clear
evidence
that
they
work
.
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
that
whatsoever
.
the
system
of
demountable
that
have
be
put
in
place
have
be
extremely
successful
.
I
know
of
only
one
breach
,
which
be
in
a
very
particular
location
and
be
due
to
a
electrical
fault
on
a
pump
,
in
the
past
ten
year
,
and
it
have
since
be
fix
.
I
,
therefore
,
see
no
reason
whatsoever
for
any
entity
or
party
to
hold
back
flood
insurance
from
any
premise
or
business
within
the
floodplain
of
Fermoy
and
Mallow
.
I
concur
with
deputy
McGrath
that
we
should
not
have
to
seek
a
legislative
solution
to
this
issue
.
what
be
the
perception
of
the
three
witness
of
the
memorandum
of
understanding
and
how
it
be
operate
as
it
relate
to
the
OPW
and
Insurance
Ireland
?
it
appear
to
I
that
it
merely
seek
to
share
information
and
do
not
go
beyond
that
.
there
do
not
appear
to
be
any
statement
of
principle
.
for
instance
,
when
the
OPW
kick
the
tyre
on
a
successful
flood
alleviation
project
,
the
OPW
's
word
do
not
seem
sufficient
within
that
memorandum
of
understanding
,
MOU
,
to
give
assurance
to
any
constituent
member
of
Insurance
Ireland
that
it
can
proceed
to
provide
insurance
in
any
area
cover
by
flood
alleviation
work
.
there
seem
to
be
a
complete
flaw
in
that
regard
.
that
be
my
first
point
and
my
first
question
.
my
second
point
-
I
would
like
the
witness
's
perception
of
this
-
concern
something
I
find
incongruous
and
contradictory
about
the
involvement
of
a
global
player
such
as
Arup
.
Arup
's
consulting
engineer
be
engage
to
assess
the
flood
relief
scheme
in
Mallow
.
the
Lagan
Group
provide
the
consulting
engineer
on
the
second
phase
.
Arup
be
a
globally
recognise
company
.
it
do
not
come
to
Mallow
and
carry
out
the
work
it
do
without
itself
have
insurance
.
there
be
more
than
100
name
,
include
some
very
big
one
,
on
the
list
of
Insurance
Ireland
's
member
.
starting
with
the
as
,
there
be
Accenture
,
American
International
Group
,
AIG
,
and
Alliance
;
go
down
the
list
,
there
be
Lloyds
and
Banco
Bilbao
Vizcaya
Argentaria
,
BBVA
.
it
be
fair
to
assume
that
any
one
of
this
member
of
Insurance
Ireland
probably
provide
arup
with
some
degree
of
cover
for
the
work
it
carry
out
.
therefore
,
it
seem
to
I
a
contradiction
that
Insurance
Ireland
be
happy
to
provide
cover
for
consulting
engineer
who
might
provide
work
and
kick
the
tyre
on
the
work
carry
out
,
which
then
pass
muster
,
and
do
not
then
provide
cover
after
the
fact
,
after
the
work
have
be
successful
-
it
be
incontrovertible
that
they
have
be
successful
-
for
the
people
who
benefit
from
the
very
scheme
provide
by
company
such
as
Lagan
and
Arup
.
there
be
a
inherent
contradiction
here
.
furthermore
,
we
be
at
a
disadvantage
here
because
Insurance
Ireland
always
come
before
the
Oireachtas
with
one
person
as
the
representative
of
all
of
this
insurance
house
.
I
contend
that
we
need
to
hear
from
individual
voice
who
have
provide
insurance
cover
in
the
past
but
who
do
not
have
the
gut
,
quite
frankly
,
to
come
before
we
and
give
a
account
of
they
action
.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
the
witness
how
they
perceive
the
contradiction
I
have
just
outline
.
I
want
to
ask
another
,
more
specific
question
.
it
be
a
very
simple
question
.
forgive
I
if
it
be
a
stupid
one
.
I
have
always
think
that
the
principle
of
insurance
cover
be
such
that
a
insurance
house
or
company
be
legally
oblige
to
provide
a
quote
and
therefore
have
to
provide
cover
.
Mr.
Kavanagh
speak
about
the
issue
of
excess
but
,
regard
instance
of
people
I
know
and
people
he
know
not
be
able
to
get
insurance
,
I
always
think
there
be
a
provision
govern
the
principle
of
provide
insurance
that
one
have
to
at
least
provide
a
quote
for
cover
.
perhaps
the
witness
could
provide
I
with
some
information
on
that
.
I
will
leave
it
at
that
for
now
.
with
the
Chairman
's
indulgence
,
I
might
come
back
in
for
one
more
bite
of
the
cherry
.
the
mou
be
not
work
-----
I
have
one
final
question
.
Mr.
Kavanagh
refer
early
to
the
risk
profile
.
the
risk
profile
,
as
I
understand
it
,
have
become
so
low
.
be
there
something
that
need
to
be
do
from
a
opw
point
of
view
regard
mapping
?
I
be
aware
of
mapping
that
have
be
use
by
insurance
company
.
they
sit
at
the
desk
,
a
customer
phone
they
,
they
look
at
the
map
and
they
say
the
customer
have
be
kick
out
of
the
system
because
the
map
in
the
first
instance
be
the
guide
they
use
.
could
we
do
something
to
address
the
mapping
issue
beyond
the
mere
desktop
?
in
other
word
,
if
we
start
drill
down
into
the
history
,
the
amount
of
money
that
have
be
spend
on
demountable
,
flood
alleviation
work
,
arterial
drainage
and
so
on
,
we
could
start
to
create
a
more
accurate
picture
of
what
be
actually
happen
in
reality
.
I
contend
,
and
I
would
like
to
hear
the
witness
's
perception
and
opinion
on
this
,
that
the
OPW
probably
have
to
push
hard
against
Insurance
Ireland
,
in
term
of
how
the
memorandum
of
understanding
actually
operate
.
Mr.
Kavanagh
mention
Cork
County
Council
.
historically
,
very
clear
protocol
be
set
in
place
,
whereby
early
warning
system
in
place
for
local
authority
staff
be
in
town
such
as
Mallow
and
Fermoy
.
it
be
pertinent
we
be
speak
about
Mallow
and
Fermoy
because
they
will
have
a
bear
on
what
happen
in
Cork
city
down
the
line
,
in
term
of
they
early
warning
system
,
which
be
now
so
robust
that
the
response
time
of
staff
in
local
authority
be
extraordinary
.
they
be
par
excellence
.
this
be
because
of
the
historical
nature
of
flooding
event
.
what
I
be
try
to
glean
,
and
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
ask
the
minister
,
be
where
the
local
authority
actually
feed
into
the
opw
process
on
early
warning
system
and
that
exchange
of
information
.
what
Mr.
Kavanagh
have
articulate
be
that
there
be
still
a
gap
between
Insurance
Ireland
and
the
OPW
on
a
raft
of
issue
that
need
to
be
articulate
and
highlight
.
it
be
robust
.
I
will
return
to
the
demountable
defence
for
a
second
.
Mr.
Thompson
give
clear
example
,
four
in
total
,
which
be
all
from
the
UK
.
let
we
work
through
the
example
.
in
2007
in
Upton
-
upon
-
Severn
"
the
demountable
defence
be
not
deploy
in
time
due
to
severe
disruption
to
the
transport
infrastructure
cause
by
flooding
.
"
what
do
that
mean
?
that
be
fine
.
in
Hereford
"
a
faulty
sensor
cause
the
failure
of
a
demountable
defence
"
.
what
happen
there
?
and
"
the
Foss
barrier
fail
after
its
pump
station
flood
.
"
in
Wales
,
"
a
temporary
steel
defence
be
not
erect
in
time
"
.
I
be
look
at
that
four
example
and
Mr.
Thompson
also
mention
example
on
the
Dodder
in
2011
and
in
Limerick
.
I
do
not
know
in
what
year
the
Limerick
example
occur
.
what
happen
exactly
in
that
two
example
?
do
the
witness
attribute
that
two
example
to
human
intervention
,
or
the
lack
of
such
intervention
?
Mr.
Thompson
speak
about
protocol
for
deployment
.
to
what
extent
be
Insurance
Ireland
and
its
constituent
member
drill
down
into
the
deployment
protocol
in
respect
of
pend
or
rise
flood
water
?
take
,
for
example
,
the
Blackwater
flow
through
Mallow
and
Fermoy
,
where
there
be
demountable
defence
.
to
what
extent
have
insurance
Ireland
's
constituent
member
see
at
first
hand
or
examine
the
protocol
which
exist
in
respect
of
that
two
town
's
defence
?
as
I
say
in
the
previous
session
,
I
live
in
Mallow
.
I
know
Mallow
and
Fermoy
intimately
.
I
know
that
there
be
incontrovertible
evidence
that
there
be
currently
no
risk
in
Mallow
.
it
be
a
similar
case
in
Fermoy
.
I
be
a
little
bit
worried
that
insurance
Ireland
be
depend
on
the
opw
,
and
on
the
information
which
flow
up
directly
from
local
authority
to
the
OPW
,
to
make
decision
.
I
be
worried
that
insurer
be
not
actually
go
out
on
the
ground
when
flooding
event
occur
.
I
contend
that
Insurance
Ireland
's
flood
working
group
depend
solely
on
what
come
through
from
the
local
authority
,
via
the
OPW
and
into
this
forum
which
Insurance
Ireland
have
with
the
OPW
.
Mr.
Thompson
use
the
word
"
anecdotally
"
.
I
do
not
want
to
up
the
ante
on
the
rhetoric
but
"
anecdotally
"
do
not
cut
the
mustard
.
I
hope
the
witness
will
bear
with
I
.
it
be
easy
to
deploy
resource
when
there
be
a
flood
pend
.
it
do
not
involve
a
big
cost
.
it
be
a
matter
of
send
somebody
down
to
observe
.
insurance
Ireland
's
member
need
to
be
on
the
ground
observe
what
be
happen
in
real
time
for
themselves
.
insurance
Ireland
's
member
hold
95
%
of
the
domestic
insurance
market
and
85
%
of
the
international
life
insurance
market
in
this
country
.
I
do
not
see
why
they
cannot
go
down
to
place
such
as
Fermoy
,
Mallow
and
other
area
which
have
be
cover
by
capital
work
carry
out
by
organisation
such
as
the
Lagan
Group
and
Arup
.
Arup
be
a
global
leader
.
it
carry
out
the
flood
alleviation
work
in
Mallow
.
Arup
recently
conduct
a
study
with
Lloyds
of
London
on
offset
or
mitigating
against
risk
for
catastrophe
owe
to
climate
change
in
global
city
.
Lloyds
be
a
member
of
Insurance
Ireland
.
I
acknowledge
Mr.
Thompson
will
not
be
able
to
respond
to
this
but
when
Arup
be
do
the
flood
alleviation
work
as
consulting
engineer
,
its
cover
for
insurance
be
be
provide
by
one
of
the
witness
's
constituent
group
.
I
find
it
incongruous
that
Arup
could
be
cover
by
one
of
Insurance
Ireland
's
constituent
group
and
the
work
could
be
stand
over
but
that
after
the
fact
,
the
people
who
rely
on
that
work
could
not
be
cover
by
one
of
he
constituent
group
.
can
Mr.
Thompson
understand
the
level
of
anger
that
exist
in
this
regard
?
I
believe
some
member
of
Insurance
Ireland
have
already
decide
they
absolutely
and
utterly
will
not
provide
flood
cover
regardless
of
what
protocol
Insurance
Ireland
put
in
place
or
be
cover
by
the
memorandum
of
understanding
,
MOU
.
they
have
just
take
a
corporate
decision
.
Mr.
Thompson
himself
mention
the
profitability
and
risk
profile
early
and
because
of
that
,
they
be
just
not
go
to
get
into
or
be
withdraw
entirely
from
this
market
.
be
that
a
formal
structure
?
or
be
it
informal
or
anecdotal
?
that
be
okay
.
I
will
come
at
this
another
way
.
Mallow
and
Fermoy
be
classical
example
of
where
the
State
have
expend
vast
taxpayer
resource
to
ensure
that
flood
plain
and
the
people
in
that
area
be
protect
.
they
have
work
.
do
Mr.
Thompson
agree
they
have
work
?
they
have
work
to
date
.
Mr.
Thompson
be
qualify
it
.
he
remain
to
be
convince
about
the
very
protocol
that
have
be
try
and
test
in
town
like
Mallow
over
decade
,
not
year
.
this
constitute
decade
of
corporate
memory
of
the
local
authority
where
staff
intergenerationally
have
clear
system
put
in
place
in
both
that
town
.
they
be
typical
of
example
throughout
the
country
where
flood
work
have
be
carry
out
.
Mr.
Thompson
still
appear
to
be
doubt
that
very
protocol
because
he
say
that
Insurance
Ireland
deploy
staff
in
Storm
Ophelia
.
I
defy
anybody
to
have
go
out
on
the
Monday
of
Storm
Ophelia
because
one
would
not
put
anyone
outside
the
door
on
that
day
.
he
be
refer
to
deploy
after
the
fact
and
not
before
the
fact
.
there
must
be
a
great
degree
of
willingness
on
the
part
of
Insurance
Ireland
to
drill
down
further
and
to
start
talk
to
local
authority
official
.
as
somebody
who
live
in
the
town
,
the
process
by
which
one
would
do
that
be
not
as
formal
,
as
formulaic
or
as
systematic
as
I
would
like
.
I
live
100
pace
from
the
Blackwater
River
and
I
still
have
not
see
the
evidence
of
this
happen
in
real
time
.
Mr.
Thompson
have
state
there
be
two
process
,
one
be
Insurance
Ireland
's
own
working
group
and
the
other
be
through
the
OPW
process
.
I
would
bet
any
money
that
the
next
time
there
be
a
pend
flood
in
Mallow
,
one
will
not
see
any
constituent
member
of
Insurance
Ireland
go
down
there
to
talk
to
local
authority
official
or
take
note
on
whether
the
demountable
be
work
.
incidentally
,
they
clearly
be
work
but
I
guarantee
there
be
no
process
in
place
for
that
.
Mr.
Thompson
might
give
I
a
straight
answer
;
he
do
not
have
to
qualify
it
.
let
I
put
it
in
another
way
.
be
it
true
that
Mr.
Thompson
will
know
when
the
next
flooding
incident
will
occur
on
the
Munster
Blackwater
?
no
,
I
do
not
mean
not
after
the
fact
.
I
refer
to
Insurance
Ireland
be
serious
about
increase
coverage
from
83
%
-
the
figure
Mr.
Thompson
mention
early
-
as
there
be
still
17
%
to
go
.
the
member
of
Insurance
Ireland
cover
95
%
of
the
market
.
Mr.
Thompson
have
tell
we
that
he
want
to
extend
and
grow
the
coverage
.
however
,
everything
he
be
say
point
to
there
still
be
many
hoop
to
be
jump
.
can
Insurance
Ireland
or
its
constituent
member
give
we
a
undertaking
?
in
he
own
submission
,
Mr.
Thompson
have
pour
doubt
over
whether
the
legislation
will
work
and
over
the
flood
re
example
in
the
UK
.
he
be
say
that
the
mou
be
everything
.
it
be
the
ship
on
which
the
insurance
industry
will
sail
.
we
have
kick
the
tyre
on
the
mou
and
no
one
here
be
absolutely
convinced
that
the
mou
be
work
.
what
we
be
try
to
do
,
piecemeal
,
be
work
through
a
system
whereby
insurance
Ireland
's
member
can
be
absolutely
and
utterly
convinced
that
they
have
witness
at
first
hand
how
the
demountable
be
work
because
the
witness
be
throw
doubt
over
the
demountable
.
that
be
the
evidence
Mr.
Thompson
be
give
here
and
he
have
cite
two
Irish
example
.
I
want
to
ensure
that
insurance
Ireland
and
its
member
will
be
confident
that
the
human
error
protocol
that
be
put
in
place
,
for
instance
,
by
Cork
County
Council
be
so
robust
as
to
ensure
the
risk
be
absolutely
and
utterly
mitigate
.
the
only
way
I
can
be
convinced
of
that
be
if
people
from
the
insurance
industry
be
deploy
on
the
ground
when
the
early
warning
system
kick
in
and
that
there
be
a
transparent
protocol
,
to
speak
to
Dr.
Surminski
's
point
,
whereby
we
can
all
see
that
the
insurance
industry
have
be
down
there
and
be
satisfied
that
the
system
have
work
.
what
do
that
mean
?
chairman
,
I
want
to
be
very
clear
here
.
there
be
nobody
talk
about
discard
the
mou
here
.
however
,
all
the
mou
provide
for
be
a
exchange
of
information
.
there
be
no
obligation
inherent
within
the
mou
.
would
Mr.
Thompson
agree
?
that
be
all
it
be
about
.
consider
for
instance
the
UK
model
,
in
which
there
be
eight
guide
principle
.
I
be
not
go
to
articulate
what
the
principle
be
,
but
it
could
be
contend
that
some
of
they
could
,
in
principle
,
be
incorporate
into
the
mou
as
well
.
we
would
not
be
distort
competition
.
this
would
allow
for
pricing
that
reflect
risk
,
which
would
deal
with
the
excess
issue
.
this
would
allow
investment
in
flood
risk
-
management
activity
and
sustainable
long
-
term
approach
to
flooding
insurance
.
we
have
to
kick
the
tyre
on
the
mou
,
because
that
be
the
only
avenue
that
we
have
,
as
individual
member
of
the
Oireachtas
,
to
advocate
for
that
who
do
not
have
flood
insurance
at
the
moment
.
insurance
Ireland
need
to
come
a
little
bit
further
more
quickly
.
some
of
Mr.
Thompson
's
language
be
encourage
,
I
will
say
that
.
he
talk
about
a
rate
of
coverage
of
83
%
and
effort
to
increase
that
rate
.
we
need
to
see
the
evidence
of
that
much
soon
.
that
be
why
my
final
question
to
he
be
this
:
have
he
receive
any
correspondence
,
or
have
any
discussion
,
with
any
of
Insurance
Ireland
's
member
who
state
absolutely
and
utterly
that
all
the
demountable
in
the
world
would
not
change
they
position
of
not
provide
insurance
cover
?
have
any
of
Insurance
Ireland
's
member
ever
come
to
Mr.
Thompson
and
say
that
they
would
not
provide
cover
,
regardless
of
how
much
be
spend
and
no
matter
what
be
do
on
river
,
river
basin
,
arterial
drainage
scheme
or
whatever
?
have
any
of
he
member
say
that
they
be
get
out
of
that
market
and
coverage
be
not
go
to
happen
?
no
?
be
Mr.
Thompson
absolutely
sure
about
that
?
none
of
Insurance
Ireland
's
member
have
say
to
Mr
Thompson
,
definitively
,
that
they
be
not
go
to
cover
flood
insurance
where
demountable
have
be
put
in
place
.
this
refer
to
Mr.
Thompson
's
OPW
working
group
.
not
all
of
the
100
member
be
on
the
OPW
working
group
.

I
apologise
for
not
be
here
for
all
the
interaction
.
many
of
my
question
have
be
address
,
so
I
will
be
very
brief
.
I
be
very
interested
to
hear
Mr.
Boland
's
and
Mr.
Maye
's
commentary
.
if
I
understand
they
statement
correctly
,
they
be
say
the
Sparkasse
model
would
fill
a
gap
in
respect
of
lending
.
could
I
get
a
understanding
as
to
whether
there
be
a
geographical
bias
in
this
regard
,
so
to
speak
?
be
we
talk
about
the
midland
,
the
north
west
,
the
south
west
or
the
south
east
?
if
I
understand
Mr.
Boland
correctly
,
if
there
be
a
good
lending
model
,
there
would
be
no
need
for
another
banking
system
.
do
I
understand
he
correctly
,
first
,
on
the
geographical
consideration
?
it
do
.
I
take
some
comfort
from
the
representative
organisation
's
intervention
today
.
if
I
read
they
correctly
,
they
be
state
they
be
open
for
business
and
ready
to
adopt
new
mechanism
to
enhance
they
offering
and
try
to
move
into
the
very
space
refer
to
where
there
be
a
gap
.
the
proof
of
this
be
,
for
instance
,
in
CUMA
and
Mr.
Molan
's
intervention
on
the
2016
regulation
,
in
which
he
state
that
in
March
commercial
loan
account
for
1.9
%
of
the
€
4.5
billion
credit
union
have
out
on
loan
,
equivalent
to
0.51
%
of
they
asset
.
do
the
delegate
take
some
comfort
from
this
proceedings
that
there
be
scope
,
subject
to
a
move
by
the
Central
Bank
,
the
Department
of
Finance
and
,
one
hope
,
this
house
,
for
the
credit
union
movement
to
step
in
and
plug
that
gap
?
that
be
understand
.
Mr.
Boland
can
take
it
that
that
be
understand
.
move
along
very
quickly
,
this
be
more
of
a
general
question
which
concern
the
perception
I
would
have
have
perhaps
a
year
or
so
ago
that
the
public
perception
be
that
credit
union
be
be
put
through
the
wringer
by
the
Central
Bank
in
term
of
regulation
.
there
be
much
discussion
at
this
committee
about
that
process
.
if
I
read
the
tone
of
the
delegate
's
intervention
today
correctly
,
one
sense
that
there
have
be
some
improvement
in
that
relationship
,
or
else
they
be
couch
they
language
in
very
careful
term
.
I
do
not
know
,
but
I
would
like
to
hear
from
the
representative
organisation
about
they
perception
of
the
relationship
with
the
Central
Bank
in
respect
of
regulation
and
the
future
of
credit
union
.
short
intervention
or
answer
will
suffice
.
I
will
start
with
Mr.
Johnson
.
in
the
context
of
regulation
,
what
be
the
state
of
the
relationship
between
the
Central
Bank
and

I

.
this
be
a
important
model
for
the
future
.
I
welcome
the
visit
of
Mr.
Verhofstadt
.
his
engagement
with
the
people
of
Northern
Ireland
,
particularly
that
in
the
Border
region
,
and
he
comment
on
enable
Northern
Ireland
to
retain
access
to
the
single
market
and
custom
union
be
warmly
welcome
.
I
concur
with
my
fellow
speaker
who
have
say
that
by
any
objective
analysis
,
as
co-ordinator
Mr.
Verhofstadt
have
display
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
dynamic
at
play
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
he
be
right
when
he
say
that
responsibility
for
find
a
solution
to
the
Irish
Border
question
lie
with
the
UK
and
no
realistic
proposal
have
yet
emerge
from
that
quarter
.
my
first
question
be
very
simple
.
will
Mr.
Verhofstadt
and
he
colleague
,
Mr.
Brok
and
Mr.
Gualtieri
,
consider
include
within
the
wording
of
any
final
European
Parliament
resolution
a
clause
that
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
be
maintain
and
the
principle
of
parity
of
esteem
and
human
rights
protection
be
upheld
,
especially
give
that
56
%
of
the
population
in
Northern
Ireland
vote
to
remain
within
the
EU
?
if
no
such
protection
be
forthcoming
from
the
UK
,
will
the
European
Parliament
veto
any
outcome
that
do
not
satisfy
that
fundamental
rights
?
my
second
question
relate
to
a
very
good
article
by
Mr.
Verhofstadt
that
be
publish
in
the
Observer
on
9
July
last
,
in
which
he
write
very
rationally
about
the
UK
position
on
citizen
's
rights
.
he
refer
particularly
to
third
country
national
,
the
new
status
that
will
pertain
in
the
UK
,
the
need
for
separate
application
for
settle
status
and
the
five
-
year
residence
requirement
.
this
be
another
simple
question
.
how
seriously
be
the
European
Parliament
take
the
UK
's
negotiating
position
,
which
be
grossly
insulting
to
any
Irish
person
live
in
the
UK
who
have
settle
there
for
year
and
have
a
intergenerational
relationship
and
which
will
set
back
the
cause
of
Anglo
-
Irish
relation
by
year
?
I
would
like
to
know
Mr.
Verhofstadt
's
opinion
on
that
.
thank
you
very
much
,
a
Chathaoirligh
.
I
apologise
for
come
late
to
the
meeting
.
I
thank
the
Chairman
for
allow
I
in
and
forgive
I
if
some
of
my
point
have
already
be
cover
.
in
regard
to
the
constituency
I
represent
,
Cork
East
,
there
be
a
deep
sense
that
there
be
not
a
policy
in
respect
of
the
delivery
of
home
care
package
.
I
know
of
nobody
who
be
in
receipt
of
a
specific
home
care
package
,
particularly
in
the
north
Cork
area
.
the
sense
I
have
of
the
situation
as
it
relate
to
north
Cork
be
such
that
the
policy
be
ad
hoc
and
that
it
be
a
little
arbitrary
in
that
there
be
no
consistency
for
each
individual
.
one
rely
on
the
service
but
one
cannot
be
guarantee
that
it
will
be
deliver
to
a
particular
person
in
he
or
she
home
at
a
give
time
and
it
can
be
cut
at
a
give
time
also
.
we
want
a
national
policy
or
guideline
that
ensure
each
person
have
a
minimum
right
.
I
realise
Mr.
Mulvihill
may
have
address
that
point
already
and
if
he
have
,
I
apologise
but
I
want
to
record
it
anyway
.
I
thank
the
delegate
for
they
presentation
and
for
deal
so
comprehensively
with
the
question
.
I
ask
member
to
remain
while
the
delegate
leave
to
deal
with
minute
and
some
housekeeping
item
.
I
want
to
speak
specifically
on
the
reconfiguration
process
in
so
far
as
it
relate
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
I
will
be
brief
because
I
realise
there
be
many
question
to
be
answer
today
.
I
raise
this
issue
on
the
Adjournment
last
week
and
be
give
a
undertaking
by
the
Minister
for
Community
,
Equality
and
Gaeltacht
affair
,
deputy
Carey
,
that
official
would
be
in
touch
with
I
to
organise
a
meeting
to
discuss
the
acute
service
and
the
reconfiguration
process
as
it
pertain
to
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
I
be
concerned
about
the
document
that
be
be
discuss
internally
.
it
relate
to
ceiling
of
care
,
certain
protocol
and
modelling
system
that
may
be
put
in
place
by
the
HSE
.
as
a
member
of
the
Mallow
General
Hospital
action
committee
and
a
representative
of
the
people
of
Cork
East
,
I
believe
this
will
have
a
adverse
effect
on
the
ability
of
the
hospital
to
deliver
acute
service
.
Professor
John
Higgins
state
the
reconfiguration
process
be
about
change
management
.
we
be
all
in
favour
of
the
change
that
be
necessary
.
we
be
give
undertaking
that
there
would
be
no
change
to
acute
medical
service
and
that
they
would
be
increase
.
we
be
tell
there
may
be
change
with
regard
to
the
delivery
of
accident
and
emergency
service
and
acute
surgical
service
.
the
document
I
put
into
the
public
domain
last
week
clearly
contradict
that
.
trust
have
break
down
.
we
buy
into
a
process
with
Professor
Higgins
whereby
we
accept
there
would
be
ongoing
negotiation
with
people
such
as
the
group
I
represent
.
when
the
document
come
into
my
possession
last
week
,
it
throw
that
process
out
the
window
.
trust
must
be
regain
because
it
have
be
lose
under
Professor
Higgins
and
the
HSE
with
regard
to
the
reconfiguration
process
.
some
member
may
feel
the
advisory
group
comprise
a
wonderful
approach
that
espouse
lateral
thinking
.
however
,
when
a
secret
advisory
group
be
put
in
place
and
people
who
have
buy
into
the
reconfiguration
process
and
who
be
try
to
manage
change
,
such
as
the
people
I
represent
,
be
not
be
consult
on
that
process
or
the
internal
document
,
it
make
a
mockery
of
the
whole
process
.
I
seek
a
meeting
with
the
head
of
the
HSE
and
the
people
who
be
in
charge
of
reconfiguration
at
national
and
local
level
.
that
be
all
I
want
.
on
behalf
of
the
member
I
thank
Professor
Drumm
for
he
five
year
of
service
.
at
that
time
he
take
on
what
look
like
be
probably
the
most
challenging
position
in
the
Irish
public
service
.
that
take
courage
and
it
probably
take
more
courage
to
stay
with
the
position
over
the
past
five
year
.
it
have
be
very
turbulent
.
I
think
history
will
record
that
he
lead
the
service
through
significant
positive
change
and
the
nation
owe
he
a
large
debt
of
gratitude
.
his
successor
will
have
big
shoe
to
fill
.
we
wish
he
well
but
we
wish
Professor
Drumm
success
in
whatever
course
he
decide

I
thank
he
for
he
courtesy
over
the
year
.
can
I
ask
the
chairman
for
some
guidance
?
I
be
not
a
member
of
this
committee
but
there
have
be
specific
reference
to
Cork
,
about
which
I
have
a
few
question
.
beg
the
indulgence
of
the
member
,
while
we
be
on
the
theme
of
Cork
and
the
governance
issue
,
I
ask
for
some
forbearance
to
ask
one
or
two
question
while
it
be
the
hot
topic
.
obviously
,
I
will
be
guide
by
the
member
and
the
chairman
on
that
matter
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
he
indulgence
and
the
committee
for
allow
I
,
as
a
non-member
,
to
pose
some
question
.
I
will
endeavour
to
be
very
brief
.
I
refer
specifically
to
the
issue
of
governance
,
particularly
as
it
relate
to
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
which
the
minister
visit
last
week
.
follow
the
visit
I
ask
a
parliamentary
question
about
the
engagement
with
clinician
at
the
hospital
.
I
be
particularly
delighted
that
Professor
Louise
Kenny
be
here
.
I
acknowledge
publicly
the
work
she
have
do
,
particularly
as
a
principal
investigator
and
a
Science
Foundation
Ireland
funding
awardee
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
work
be
do
at
the
infant
centre
at
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
where
the
research
conduct
be
world
class
.
to
get
down
to
brass
tack
,
my
parliamentary
question
be
related
specifically
to
the
issue
of
wait
list
for
gynecological
service
.
we
have
have
a
articulation
of
the
pressure
and
the
potential
for
the
presentation
of
cancer
case
in
the
absence
of
proper
and
timely
intervention
.
when
I
ask
the
minister
what
he
intention
be
on
wait
list
,
he
reply
:
I
be
assure
that
the
2017
NTPF
waiting
list
initiative
will
help
to
alleviate
some
of
the
difficulty
in
Cork
.
in
2017
,
the
NTPF
will
have
a
allocation
of
€
20
million
and
,
in
the
first
instance
,
in
the
region
of
€
5
million
will
be
target
at
day
case
procedure
.
the
NTPF
anticipate
that
2500
of
the
long
waiting
day
case
patient
,
include
patient
on
the
CUMH
waiting
list
,
will
be
treat
under
this
initiative
.
my
question
be
very
simple
.
be
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
the
proper
mechanism
under
which
woman
wait
to
be
see
at
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
should
be
deal
with
?
I
have
my
doubt
about
whether
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
be
the
correct
mechanism
or
the
most
appropriate
solution
to
this
problem
and
I
ask
Professor
Kenny
and
she
colleague
for
they
view
in
that
regard
.
there
be
two
theatre
in
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
,
but
I
understand
only
one
be
open
and
four
day
a
week
.
as
such
,
it
be
operate
at
a
sub-optimal
level
.
I
ask
for
the
perspective
of
Professor
Kenny
of
how
this
be
impact
on
service
and
whether
,
if
the
two
theatre
be
operate
at
the
optimum
level
,
that
would
be
the
good
use
of
resource
.
in
that
case
let
I
couch
it
in
the
language
of
the
national
maternity
strategy
.
if
we
be
to
have
a
fully
operational
national
maternity
strategy
,
there
be
a
governance
issue
,
to
which
the
delegate
have
refer
.
it
be
evident
by
any
objective
analysis
of
the
operation
of
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
under
the
umbrella
of
Cork
University
Hospital
have
be
to
the
detriment
of
health
service
for
woman
.
there
be
a
very
clear
,
linear
connection
.
I
be
try
to
ascertain
something
on
the
governance
issue
that
have
be
refer
to
and
relate
it
to
the
south
/
south
west
hospital
group
.
we
be
be
tell
that
the
HSE
's
national
woman
and
infant
health
programme
and
maternity
network
will
be
establish
across
hospital
group
,
if
it
have
not
already
be
do
.
my
question
be
whether
,
if
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
be
part
of
the
south
/
south
west
hospital
group
,
it
be
be
represent
adequately
within
the
group
such
that
there
be
transfer
of
funding
and
resource
from
the
parent
hospital
in
a
manner
which
ensure
service
be
deliver
for
woman
.
can
the
witness
respond
on
the
NTPF
issue
?
it
be
important
with
regard
to
the
waiting
list
.
there
be
a
element
of
risk
.
we
will
discuss
overcrowding
in
accident
and
emergency
department
at
we
next
meeting
.

.
that
be
it
in
a
nutshell
.
I
have
bring
forward
my
Bill
on
the
basis
that
I
believe
the
State
should
move
to
legislate
.
I
understand
the
government
state
its
intention
to
legislate
on
a
early
stage
.
on
second
Stage
of
the
Bill
such
a
commitment
be
make
.
I
have
not
have
sight
of
any
government
proposal
to
legislate
for
the
prohibition
of
microplastic
yet
.
I
be
hopeful
we
can
keep
this
issue
on
the
agenda
.
if
the
government
be
to
legislate
for
this
and
if
we
see
the
head
of
a
Bill
come
from
government
,
I
would
be
very
happy
to
withdraw
or
amend
my
legislation
.
until
such
time
as
that
happen
,
I
hope
to
keep
the
Bill
on
the
agenda
.
if
the
second
stage
debate
be
anything
to
go
by
,
it
be
something
on
which
there
be
a
willingness
across
party
political
line
to
legislate
for
and
to
be
see
as
take
leadership
on
globally
,
give
we
be
a
maritime
nation
.
the
scourge
of
microplastic
be
something
that
be
have
untold
health
consequence
for
sea
life
.
we
now
have
evidence
that
it
be
find
its
way
into
the
food
chain
.
it
be
quite
a
important
issue
.
I
be
hopeful
the
committee
will
retain
the
legislation
or
allow
for
safe
passage
of
the
legislation
.
there
may
be
a
defence
by
the
government
on
this
to
the
effect
that
there
be
single
market
implication
for
the
introduction
of
legislation
of
this
nature
.
I
appreciate
that
the
then
minister
communicate
with
Commissioner
Vella
.
I
be
not
sure
what
the
status
of
that
interaction
be
at
present
but
there
be
a
precedent
when
the
former
Minister
for
Health
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
,
introduce
the
smoking
ban
.
it
could
have
be
argue
at
that
time
that
it
could
have
run
contrary
to
some
of
the
treaty
provision
relate
to
the
single
Market
but
as
it
be
subsequently
deem
successful
as
a
measure
,
the
same
could
apply
here
.
the
important
point
be
that
a
number
of
country
have
sign
up
to
the
principle
of
ban
microplastic
.
this
go
as
far
back
as
December
2014
in
respect
of
the
Netherlands
,
Austria
,
Luxembourg
,
Belgium
and
Sweden
.
a
joint
press
statement
be
release
by
this
country
call
for
the
ban
and
the
political
willingness
be
there
.
regard
the
communication
from
the
commission
,
I
have
not
see
a
legislative
proposal
or
commission
proposal
as
of
yet
regard
this
issue
.
it
may
be
there
;
I
may
have
miss
it
.
however
,
I
believe
,
as
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
say
,
that
there
be
a
strong
willingness
within
the
community
for
Ireland
to
take
a
lead
on
that
and
that
be
the
main
purpose
of
the
legislation
.
I
do
not
have
any
specific
information
about
what
be
happen
in
other
country
throughout
the
EU
.
I
be
base
my
legislation
very
much
on
policy
and
principle
and
be
seek
to
find
a
mechanism
through
the
Irish
Legislature
as
to
how
we
can
design
robust
legislation
for
this
issue
.
I
have
a
very
open
mind
about
this
.
I
would
be
quite
happy
be
the
government
to
decide
to
take
my
legislation
and
to
amend
it
significantly
to
allow
for
legislative
passage
of
the
Bill
.
I
would
very
much
welcome
a
further
deliberation
,
if
necessary
,
by
this
committee
on
some
of
that
question
.
if
the
committee
decide
that
it
be
necessary
to
have
further
deliberation
with
outside
person
such
as
expert
in
the
field
,
I
would
be
very
happy
to
take
part
in
that
.
this
Bill
seek
to
strengthen
the
Green
Party
Bill
because
the
rebuttal
by
government
of
that
Bill
be
on
the
basis
that
it
could
run
contrary
to
single
market
or
treaty
provision
.
we
have
build
into
the
legislation
what
we
hope
be
a
strengthening
of
that
.
a
research
report
commission
by
the
Commission
in
January
2016
state
it
be
unclear
as
to
whether
any
of
the
exist
directive
or
regulation
that
have
be
identify
would
be
suitable
.
the
EU
be
in
a
space
at
present
where
it
have
not
come
to
a
definitive
position
on
this
.
it
seem
to
be
a
iterative
process
.
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
say
that
the
Canadian
and
US
legislation
may
not
necessarily
be
transferable
to
a
EU
scenario
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
there
be
challenge
to
pass
this
legislation
but
if
we
can
move
to
the
principle
of
the
legislation
and
if
this
House
decide
that
it
want
to
legislate
for
this
,
we
can
find
way
of
do
so
.
I
thank
deputy
Sean
Sherlock
for
attend
and
engage
with
the
committee
.
the
committee
will
meet
official
from
the
Department

it
be

I
have

question
but
I
be
conscious
that
I
be
a
guest
of
the
committee
.
I
thank
the
member
.
I
thank
the
official
and
the
academic
for
they
attendance
today
because
I
believe
that
have
this
opportunity
to
interact
with
they
be
a
crucial
part
of
the
legislative
process
.
I
view
it
as
a
free
tutorial
,
for
which
I
be
very
grateful
.
I
also
thank
the
chair
and
the
member
of
the
committee
for
facilitate
the
discussion
this
morning
.
the
key
point
that
emerge
from
the
evidence
before
we
be
that
there
be
no
doubt
but
that
there
be
clear
evidence
of
the
presence
of
microfibre
and
microbead
in
sea
life
and
on
land
,
have
be
wash
ashore
.
the
witness
have
present
clear
evidence
of
that
today
.
the
Dublin
Bay
prawn
present
be
a
very
distinct
piece
of
evidence
to
that
effect
.
I
believe
this
make
the
legislation
all
the
more
worthwhile
in
that
sense
.
I
appreciate
the
point
be
make
about
the
legislation
I
have
introduce
.
it
deal
specifically
with
microbead
that
,
accord
to
the
presentation
,
represent
a
small
fraction
in
sea
life
and
flora
and
fauna
.
however
,
my
Bill
be
a
first
or
a
second
cut
.
this
be
a
iterative
process
and
I
be
not
tie
to
the
fact
that
it
should
deal
only
with
microbead
.
I
be
quite
happy
for
it
to
be
amend
in
any
way
to
reflect
the
reality
of
the
science
present
before
we
.
if
that
mean
deal
with
microfibre
or
any
other
particle
present
that
fall
into
the
general
microplastic
group
,
then
I
have
no
qualm
about
that
whatsoever
.
the
key
thing
be
that
we
be
at
a
juncture
where
we
be
acknowledge
there
be
a
need
to
legislate
on
this
issue
.
it
need
to
be
do
post
-
haste
.
my
first
question
be
to
the
official
,
namely
,
Mr.
Harrington
and
Mr.
O'Connor
.
they
mention
that
the
head
of
a
Bill
will
come
before
we
or
that
a
Bill
be
be
work
on
.
can
they
be
more
specific
on
when
that
government
Bill
will
come
before
the
House
?
I
appreciate
that
and
that
be
clear
evidence
of
action
by
the
government
in
this
regard
.
while
this
not
a
remark
direct
at
the
official
per
se
but
be
more
a
political
statement
,
I
must
state
that
this
legislation
have
be
in
gestation
since
2016
.
I
have
hope
we
would
be
further
along
the
line
at
this
stage
because
I
have
always
express
my
willingness
to
withdraw
my
Bill
be
more
robust
legislation
to
come
along
.
this
be
a
non-partisan
and
a
non-political
issue
.
I
want
to
take
a
bipartisan
approach
to
this
matter
.
I
still
feel
the
need
to
ensure
my
legislation
be
keep
on
the
book
until
such
time
as
I
see
evidence
from
the
government
as
to
the
seriousness
of
its
intention
.
that
be
notwithstand
the
additional
resource
which
have
be
allocate
to
this
.
I
refer
back
to
the
originator
of
the
legislation
,
who
be
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
.
we
be
only
take
up
the
cudgel
on
this
.
however
,
we
do
need
to
see
this
government
legislation
soon
rather
than
late
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
Mr.
Harrington
be
seek
permission
within
a
month
to
draw
up
head
of
a
Bill
.
I
be
anxious
that
the
clock
might
tick
down
on
the
lifetime
of
the
government
or
that
its
mandate
may
expire
.
it
be
a
private
Member
's
Bill
.
I
be
conscious
that
if
Mr.
Harrington
be
talk
about
the
summer
month
for
this
,
it
then
will
not
be
long
until
we
be
into
the
autumn
and
then
into
2019
.
we
do
not
know
what
be
go
to
happen
then
.
as
I
understand
it
,
my
private
Member
's
Bill
fall
on
the
ending
of
that
mandate
.
in
2018
?
I
appreciate
that
comment
.
I
recognise
Mr.
Harrington
be
speak
for
the
minister
here
.
however
,
we
will
have
a
opportunity
to
talk
to
the
minister
directly
about
this
as
well
and
kick
the
tyre
on
he
commitment
.
I
will
return
briefly
to
the
science
again
,
just
for
a
moment
.
the
scientific
rigour
that
have
be
apply
here
show
we
that
the
research
in
a
Irish
context
be
nascent
in
the
grand
narrative
of
thing
.
it
be
from
2014
I
think
.
I
acknowledge
the
witness
probably
have
all
be
work
in
this
area
prior
to
this
.
can
I
get
a
sense
from
the
witness
as
to
where
the
Legislature
need
to
go
on
this
issue
?
that
be
pull
they
from
the
realm
of
pure
academic
research
into
the
realm
of
politics
.
I
be
direct
this
at
Dr.
Nash
.
if
she
be
design
legislation
or
a
response
to
the
scourge
of
microplastic
and
microbead
,
this
plastic
pollution
that
be
kill
we
flora
and
fauna
and
be
ingest
by
human
being
,
where
would
she
go
,
where
would
she
start
or
what
would
she
do
?
it
be
a
tough
one
but
I
just
want
to
get
the
perspective
of
the
witness
on
it
because
I
think
it
be
vital
.
forgive
I
,
do
that
mean
more
time
be
need
to
design
the
legislation
?
if
the
legislation
be
to
be
design
in
a
robust
way
,
do
it
need
a
strong
scientific
and
research
basis
?
be
Dr.
Nash
state
that
industry
need
to
be
involve
because
the
generator
of
this
plastic
need
to
be
involve
?
be
she
talk
about
a
more
holistic
approach
?
just
-----
to
be
helpful
,
I
recognise
that
Dr.
Nash
be
say
that
it
be
too
narrow
and
that
microbead
,
base
on
the
evidence
put
forward
from
Nephrops
norvegicus
,
be
only
something
like
2
%
of
the
content
and
75
%
be
microfibre
.
that
make
the
legislative
proposal
before
we
here
quite
narrow
.
we
could
legislate
for
microbead
,
but
the
point
be
we
need
legislation
with
much
broad
scope
because
,
base
on
the
evidence
before
we
,
microbead
only
represent
a
portion
of
the
plastic
use
.
in
that
sense
,
the
legislation
be
quite
narrow
.
as
I
be
conscious
of
time
and
the
format
be
use
,
I
be
happy
to
stop
and
come
back
in
at
the
end
of
the
process
,
with
the
chairman
's
permission
.
be
Cuala
the
GAA
-----
as
the
originator
of
the
Bill
,
the
deputy
be
correct
in
the
sense
that
the
initial
mood
of
the
government
and
the
speech
that
be
distribute
to
we
on
the
night
of
the
second
stage
debate
be
in
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
there
have
be
some
discussion
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Coveney
,
to
he
credit
and
he
decide
subsequently
to
come
on
board
.
I
think
deputy
Barry
be
correct
in
that
sense
.
I
be
again
conscious
of
time
.
my
Bill
be
very
simple
and
it
deal
with
a
bespoke
element
of
the
entirety
of
the
challenge
-
microbead
.
I
be
very
happy
to
change
the
title
of
my
Bill
to
call
it
the
prohibition
of
microbead
Bill
2016
or
such
.
this
be
where
the
scientific
research
have
be
invaluable
to
we
.
it
really
explain
to
we
just
how
large
the
scope
be
and
the
methodology
that
one
need
to
underpin
all
of
the
research
,
and
that
work
be
ongoing
.
the
wording
of
my
Bill
be
"
any
cosmetic
contain
micro-
plastic
be
guilty
of
a
offence
"
.
I
allow
for
summary
offence
.
it
call
for
penalty
if
one
manufacture
,
sell
or
import
.
I
also
set
out
what
would
be
actually
ban
.
this
be
all
what
I
would
call
product
of
conspicuous
consumption
.
they
be
not
necessity
.
they
include
a
"
personal
care
product
include
but
not
limit
to
a
facial
scrub
,
soap
,
lotion
,
shower
gel
,
sunscreen
,
make
-
up
,
deodorant
or
toothpaste
"
.
we
be
not
ban
that
product
but
we
be
ban
product
of
that
nature
that
contain
microbead
.
we
have
a
scientific
definition
of
microbead
.
my
Bill
be
very
simple
.
notwithstanding
the
government
's
intention
,
I
cannot
see
what
it
be
that
the
committee
will
produce
that
be
more
robust
or
comprehensive
than
this
if
we
be
deal
specifically
and
only
with
the
issue
of
microbead
.
that
be
the
point
I
really
want
to
make
.
I
welcome
this
interaction
and
the
bona
fide
of
the
Department
official
.
I
recognise
the
challenge
.
maybe
the
wording
of
my
Bill
need
work
and
I
acknowledge
that
.
one
could
amend
my
Bill
to
say
that
microbead
or
microplastic
mean
plastic
particle
of
less
than
5
mm
in
diameter
,
for
instance
.
in
one
fall
swoop
,
the
legislation
would
remove
a
array
of
product
for
which
there
be
incontrovertible
proof
that
they
find
they
way
into
watercourse
.
that
could
be
do
in
a
very
short
time
.
that
be
also
the
intention
of
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
's
Bill
before
it
be
oppose
.
I
do
not
see
why
that
could
not
be
do
at
a
early
juncture
while
work
on
the
wide
issue
of
marine
litter
in
parallel
.
the
witness
come
here
with
the
issue
of
marine
litter
very
firmly
in
they
sight
.
finally
,
I
return
to
Senator
Grace
O'Sullivan
's
point
that
the
funding
for
research
on
this
be
something
that
need
to
be
look
at
.
I
will
go
to
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
will
speak
to
the
Minister
and
the
Marine
Institute
to
see
if
there
be
a
mechanism
.
it
may
be
that
there
be
a
mechanism
for
research
this
area
in
term
of
societal
challenge
through
Horizon
2020
.
I
be
at
the
negotiating
table
for
Horizon
2020
and
recall
that
this
be
look
at
as
one
of
the
societal
challenge
and
that
there
should
be
fund
available
for
this
.
it
would
not
take
a
lot
of
money
to
buttress
the
research
that
the
witness
be
do
which
be
vital
if
we
be
look
at
the
entirety
of
the
coastline
of
Ireland
.
we
can
also
keep
eat
the
Dublin
Bay
prawn
.
it
do
not
go
into
the
part
that
be
consume
.
it
be
important
to
state
that
for
the
record
.
as
no

anything
further

we

this

as

a

I
shall
comment
further
on
Horizon

-
the
Framework

2020
.
in
the
context
of
the
negotiation
on
Horizon

,
the
EU

next
funding
programme

the

propose
a

text
of

for
approval
by
the
Council
of
Minister
.
as
the
proposal
require
co-decision
with
the
European
Parliament
,
I
expect
trilogue
negotiation
between
the
Council
,
Parliament
and
Commission
to
be
commence
under
Ireland
's
Presidency
.
it
will
be
a
priority
for
I
to
complete
this
trilogue
negotiation
and
secure
agreement
on
Horizon
2020
during
the
Presidency
.
with
regard
to
European
research
area
or
era
,
the
European
Commission
will
make
a
presentation
on
a
reinforce
European
research
area
partnership
for
excellence
and
growth
.
the
overarching
objective
of
the
European
Commission
be
to
open
up
and
connect
EU
research
system
,
thus
lead
to
a
significant
improvement
in
Europe
's
research
performance
to
promote
growth
and
job
creation
.
more
join
up
and
smart
specialisation
across
member
state
will
be
a
significant
milestone
en
route
to
a
fully
develop
European
research
area
and
will
avoid
costly
overlap
and
unnecessary
duplication
of
activity
.
the
Irish
Presidency
will
highlight
the
importance
of
joint
programming
in
address
the
fragmentation
of
research
in
Europe
and
its
role
in
contribute
to
the
achievement
of
the
European
research
area
.
on
research
career
,
the
Irish
Presidency
will
provide
a
opportunity
to
assess
progress
and
map
out
outstanding
issue
in
the
area
.
with
regard
to
good
access
to
scientific
information
,
the
concept
of
open
access
to
publicly
-
fund
scientific
datum
have
be
around
for
some
time
,
have
first
be
put
forward
by
the
commission
and
endorse
by
the
Council
.
progress
on
open
access
to
scientific
datum
have
be
slow
due
to
a
number
of
barrier
identify
in
the
commission
communication
.
in
brief
,
this
be
:
the
potential
of
the
Internet
for
improve
access
to
scientific
information
have
not
be
fully
exploit
;
the
low
level
of
investment
in
the
scientific
dissemination
system
;
the
uneven
and
unco-ordinated
action
by
the
different
member
state
;
the
cost
associate
with
the
process
of
select
,
review
and
publish
article
;
and
the
lack
of
financing
for
rapidly
emerge
e-infrastruce
and
thematic
datum
infrastructure
for
store
and
provide
access
to
datum
.
in
addition
,
funding
have
tend
to
be
short
live
and
fragmented
.
it
be
often
related
to
specific
project
only
and
have
not
provide
long
-
term
solution
.
the
commission
communication
encourage
all
member
state
to
intensify
they
effort
to
implement
open
access
and
follow
up
the
communication
with
a
recommendation
for
endorsement
by
the
European
Parliament
and
the
Council
.
it
call
on
the
member
state
to
implement
open
access
and
to
report
back
to
the
Council
on
progress
18
month
after
the
recommendation
and
every
two
year
,
thereafter
.
in
order
to
give
effect
to
this
,
each
member
state
be
instruct
to
designate
by
the
end
of
2012
a
national
point
of
reference
whose
task
will
be
as
follow
:
to
co-ordinate
the
measure
list
in
the
recommendation
;
to
act
as
interlocutor
with
the
European
Commission
on
question
pertain
to
access
to
and
preservation
of
scientific
information
;
and
to
report
on
the
follow
-
up
to
the
recommendation
.
Ireland
be
supportive
of
the
proposal
to
implement
open
access
to
scientific
information
and
allow
for
the
protection
of
legitimate
commercial
interest
.
we
be
conscious
that
there
may
be
significant
cost
factor
involve
in
establish
the
necessary
e-infrastruce
for
datum
storage
.
there
may
also
be
legal
barrier
to
implementation
across
the
EU
which
must
be
address
.
there
be
a
small
number
of
"
any
other
business
"
item
on
the
agenda
.
of
significance
be
the
item
that
relate
to
communication
on
enhance
and
focus
international
co-operation
in
research
and
the
single
Market
Act
ii
,
as
mention
early
.
I
shall
comment
on
the
communication
on
enhance
and
focus
international
co-operation
in
research
.
the
European
Commission
will
present
its
communication
date
14
September
entitle
enhance
EU
International
Co-operation
in
Research
and
Innovation
.
the
communication
set
out
a
new
strategy
to
help
the
European
Union
maximise
the
opportunity
present
by
globalisation
of
research
and
innovation
.
obviously
the
single
Market
Act
ii
be
the
second
phase
of
the
single
Market
Act
and
comprise
a
new
set
of
12
priority
action
.
the
single
Market
Act
ii
will
be
present
in
the
form
of
a
commission
communication
by
Commissioner
Barnier
,
as
indicate
early
.
I
shall
now
discuss
the
Department
's
priority
for
the
EU
Presidency
2013
.
my
Department
will
play
a
central
role
in
drive
the
EU
policy
agenda
embody
in
the
overarching
policy
theme
of
''
promote
sustainable
economic
growth
and
job
and
building
Europe
's
competitive
advantage
"
.
with
the
permission
of
the
chair
,
I
will
call
on
my
official
,
Mr.
Tommy
Murray
and
Mr.
Pat
Kelly
,
on
some
of
the
technical
issue
.
I
be
not
aware
of
the
sunset
clause
to
which
Senator
Quinn
refer
,
but
I
will
defer
to
Mr.
Murray
to
answer
that
specific
question
.
the
issue
relate
to
food
be
in
the
health
silo
but
we
have
a
prioritisation
action
group
which
be
a
research
prioritisation
exercise
.
we
have
streamline
what
must
be
do
.
the
country
need
to
engage
in
14
key
area
of
research
,
and
food
be
one
of
that
area
.
Teagasc
would
be
one
of
the
stakeholder
in
the
prioritisation
action
group
because
we
be
try
to
set
out
a
new
stall
that
do
not
put
its
eye
on
basic
research
or
blue
sky
research
but
move
to
a
area
where
we
get
a
close
alignment
with
industry
.
it
be
the
collaboration
between
academia
and
industry
that
will
drive
job
growth
.
on
the
announcement
by
Teagasc
that
it
be
trial
potato
crop
in
certain
part
of
the
country
,
I
would
have
no
problem
on
the
basis
that
there
be
a
inherent
trust
in
the
work
that
Teagasc
do
and
there
be
a
grow
realisation
that
the
exponential
increase
in
global
population
deem
it
that
we
as
a
country
must
engage
in
new
technology
to
ensure
the
people
on
this
planet
can
feed
themselves
.
that
be
the
high
level
view
but
if
one
be
drill
down
into
a
more
granular
level
that
should
present
opportunity
for
Ireland
.
I
take
Senator
Quinn
's
point
on
innovation
in
that
regard
.
I
have
a
open
mind
but
it
be
within
the
health
remit
.
that
be
not
to
kick
the
issue
to
touch
.
I
be
always
happy
to
engage
further
on
that
agenda
if
need
be
because
I
firmly
believe
we
must
grapple
with
it
at
some
stage
.
Senator
Quinn
make
the
point
that
the
State
should
create
the
environment
for
the
entrepreneur
.
the
architecture
of
the
action
plan
for
job
be
base
on
engage
with
industry
,
employer
,
business
group
and
so
on
.
the
Minister
for
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Richard
Bruton
,
issue
a
invitation
to
that
group
to
come
up
with
idea
.
the
State
have
a
clear
role
.
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
2012
be
be
drive
directly
by
the
Taoiseach
through
the
cabinet
sub
-committee
on
economic
recovery
and
job
.
in
my
area
of
responsibility
,
research
and
innovation
,
there
be
a
very
clear
sense
of
drive
new
message
to
academia
in
term
of
try
to
foster
great
collaboration
with
industry
through
the
prioritisation
action
group
.
we
do
a
great
deal
of
work
on
the
foreign
direct
investment
side
of
the
house
but
the
clear
challenge
be
to
try
to
create
more
indigenous
company
arise
from
that
.
there
be
a
great
role
for
the
State
to
play
in
facilitate
innovation
.
the
State
agency
be
feed
into
the
action
plan
for
job
.
the
cabinet

on
economic

and
job
have
a
result
-
drive
agenda
.
deputy
Seán
Kyne
raise
the
issue
of
raw

.
we
may
have
a
traditional
view
of
they
in

of
what
can
be

from
the

.
for
example
,
at
the

in

,
house
near

,
material
science
be
become
ever
more
important
as

subject
in

when

to

most
basic
level
,

be
how
we
be

,
datum
production
and
so
on
in
term
of
the
use
of
raw
material
to
drive
new
technological
advance
.
the
partnership
will
target
non-energy
and
non-agricultural

,
include
but
not
limit
to
the
European

list
of
critical
raw

it
cover
metallic
industrial
and
construction
material
,
as
well
as
other
industrial
raw

such
as

many
of
this
material
be
vital

for
innovative

that
offer
environmentally

tech
application
.
they
be
also
essential
for
the
manufacture
of

require
by
modern

.
that
be
the
commission
's
definition
in
its
own
word
.
on
the
issue
of
open

,
we
have
a
intellectual

which
be

on
this
year

academia
and
industry
,
there
be
a
need
to
set
out
some
rule
of
engagement
because
if
there
be
private
capital
for
research
,
one
must
ensure
there
be
a
protocol
in
place
for
how
that
funding
be
use
.
however
,
where
there
be
publicly
fund
research
,
a
protocol
be
in
place
in
term
of
the
interaction
involve
.
if
we
be
to
examine
the
issue
of
open
access
from
a
global
perspective
and
the
European
Union
be
to
compete
globally
with
other
hegemonic
area
of
the
globe
such
as
the
US
or
Asia
,
the
great
the
degree
of
co-ordination
on
strategy
to
enable
open
access
the
great
the
level
of
competitiveness
that
can
be
drive
on
a
pan-European
basis
.
if
Ireland
be
ahead
of
the
curve
on
a
EU
-
wide
basis
,
that
put
it
in
the
early
mover
stage
which
will
allow
we
to
benefit
from
potential
financial
package
arise
from
EU
programme
.
for
example
,
the
government
will
deal
with
open
datum
system
as
one
of
the
disrupter
technology
and
see
how
we
can
secure
a
great
degree
of
co-ordination
across
Department
and
between
industry
and
government
in
respect
of
how
we
can
mind
more
of
the
information
derive
in
every
day
life
in
order
that
we
become
a
first
mover
in
that
space
.
I
hope
that
deal
adequately
with
the
question
put
by
deputy
Seán
Kyne
.
I
will
refer
the
question
on
the
consumer
agenda
,
the
single
Market
Act
and
the
progress
make
on
smart
regulation
to
Mr.
Murray
.
on
my
own
agenda
,
we
have
set
target
in
regard
to
access
to
finance
.
the
next
Horizon
2020
framework
programme
for
which
I
will
have
specific
responsibility
could
"
potentially
"
be
a
€
80
billion
package
,
subject
to
the
multiannual
financial
framework
.
if
it
be
a
€
80
billion
package
,
we
hope
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
in
which
we
be
engage
in
14
key
priority
area
that
we
be
go
to
fund
will
align
with
the
Horizon
2020
framework
programme
priority
.
arise
from
this
,
the
target
figure
would
be
uppe
from
15
%
to
20
%
in
term
of
sme
engagement
.
we
need
to
ensure
great
engagement
by
sme
.
in
Ireland
I
understand
work
on
the
foreign
direct
investment
aspect
of
the
puzzle
be
progress
well
in
term
of
that
engagement
with
the
research
community
,
but
we
need
to
do
more
to
ensure
more
indigenous
company
thrive
.
I
will
refer
the
overall
arching
issue
of
access
to
finance
to
Mr.
Murray
.
I
shall
try
to
answer
the
acting
chairman
and
give
the
Irish
position
because
he
ask
a
question
on
the
single
Market
Act
.
to
be
fair
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
regard
he
interaction
with
Commissioner
Barnier
,
there
be
a
determination
to
distil
the
act
into
area
where
Ireland
have
a
interest
.
in
term
of
the
Presidency
we
be
talk
about
the
propose
establishment
of
a
high
level
group
on
service
to
business
and
progress
the
digital
single
market
agenda
,
especially
build
confidence
measure
in
cross
-
border
transaction
.
with
regard
to
the
cloud
computing
sector
,
there
be
the
language
of
the
sme
access
to
capital
market
,
access
to
banking
service
,
a
professional
qualification
directive
and
issue
around
public
procurement
.
I
agree
with
the
Acting
chairman
that
the
language
use
be
arcane
and
do
not
reflect
the
vernacular
or
everyday
usage
.
in
term
of
a
engagement
with
27
member
state
,
it
be
a
language
that
people
subscribe
to
but
I
take
he
point
.
by
way
of
example
,
the
Department
be
determined
to
ensure
that
when
Council
meeting
take
place
,
we
can
distil
the
language
of
the
commission
's
proposal
or
Council
regulation
into
a
language
that
can
be
disseminate
in
a
way
that
every
person
,
include
minister
,
can
grapple
with
.
I
wish
to
reinforce
the
idea
that
the
government
be
prioritise
smart
regulation
through
the
entrepreneurship
agenda
and
reduce
the
regulatory
burden
.
hence
,
the
communication
between
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
and
Commissioner
Barnier
.
there
will
be
a
impetus
during
the
first
six
month
of
the
Presidency
to
drive
result
and
reduce
regulation
in
the
SME
sector
.
over-regulation
be
a
key
impediment
to
sme
competitiveness
.
today
,
the
Department
want
to
disseminate
the
message
that
reduce
regulation
be
one
of
the
key
theme
of
the
Irish
Presidency
.
we
wish
to
assist
small
business
that
the
Acting
Chairman
talk
about
.
I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
I
thank
the
delegation
for
they
attendance
.
I
thank
the
delegation
for
they
attendance
.
I
thank
the
delegation
for
they
attendance
.
I
thank
the
delegation
for
they
attendance
.
I
thank
the
delegation
for
they
attendance
.
I
thank
Deputy
and
Senator
for
they
kind
remark
on
the
Presidency
.
I
concur
that
we
department
be
not
see
as
a
shine
light
relative
to
other
in
respect
of
what
we
have
deliver
.
I
add
to
the
comment
of
the
minister
by
say
that
many
of
we
official
have
to
up
tent
and
peg
to
Brussels
for
six
month
,
leave
they
family
and
significant
other
behind
,
to
chair
working
group
and
participate
in
hundred
of
meeting
.
they
have
to
chair
trilogue
with
a
gargantuan
effort
.
perhaps
it
be
easy
for
we
to
walk
into
a
chamber
of
minister
and
other
colleague
and
just
take
the
plaudit
,
so
I
also
officially
record
my
gratitude
to
the
official
for
the
work
they
have
do
.
Horizon
2020
be
a
win
for
Ireland
as
we
successfully
conclude
a
package
which
be
worth
€
70
billion
,
and
within
that
there
be
potential
for
Ireland
to
surpass
the
framework
programme
target
of
€600
million
.
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
reach
a
target
of
€
1
billion
of
a
drawdown
during
the
lifetime
of
the
next
programme
.
it
be
fortuitous
that
the
co-decision
procedure
allow
we
to
conclude
that
negotiation
,
which
I
chair
.
they
be
conclude
with
Commissioner
Geoghegan
-
Quinn
and
the
rapporteur
within
the
European
Parliament
.
the
research
part
of
the
Competitiveness
Council
will
deal
with
the
follow
-
on
from
that
negotiation
,
deal
with
issue
related
to
the
next
EU
framework
for
research
and
innovation
,
Horizon
2020
,
the
innovation
union
and
the
European
research
area
.
during
we
Presidency
,
Ireland
successfully
negotiate
a
political
agreement
on
the
proposal
for
the
EU
's
€
70
billion
research
and
innovation
programme
,
Horizon
2020
.
research
and
innovation
be
key
driver
of
growth
and
job
creation
.
the
strategic
approach
to
research
and
innovation
contain
in
Horizon
2020
will
develop
,
diffuse
and
drive
research
across
the
European
Union
.
the
Competitiveness
Council
will
receive
presentation
from
the
European
Commission
on
proposal
for
a
investment
package
of
more
than
€
22
billion
under
Horizon
2020
over
the
next
seven
year
in
innovation
for
sector
that
deliver
high
quality
job
.
most
of
the
investment
will
go
to
five
public
private
partnership
in
innovative
medicine
,
aeronautics
,
bio
-
base
industry
,
fuel
cell
and
hydrogen
,
as
well
as
electronics
.
this
research
partnership
will
boost
the
competitiveness
of
EU
industry
in
sector
that
already
provide
more
than
4
million
job
and
also
find
solution
to
major
challenge
for
society
that
be
not
be
solve
quickly
enough
by
the
market
alone
,
such
as
reduce
carbon
emission
or
provide
the
next
generation
of
antibiotic
.
the
package
also
include
four
public
public
partnership
,
so
-
call
,
between
the
European
Commission
and
EU
member
state
on
new
treatment
against
poverty
related
disease
,
measurement
technology
for
industrial
competitiveness
,
support
for
high
tech
small
and
medium
enterprise
and
solution
for
the
elderly
and
disabled
to
live
safely
in
they
home
.
the
council
will
also
receive
presentation
from
the
European
Commission
on
its
communication
on
the
State
of
the
Innovation
Union
2012
-
accelerate
change
and
on
measure
innovation
output
in
Europe
:
towards
a
New
Indicator
,
and
on
progress
on
the
European
research
area
.
the
communication
on
the
State
of
the
Innovation
Union
2012
note
significant
progress
towards
set
the
policy
framework
for
a
innovation
union
in
various
area
accelerate
the
development
and
uptake
of
innovation
to
address
societal
challenge
.
the
business
environment
in
Europe
will
become
more
innovation
-
friendly
with
single
market
measure
such
as
the
unitary
patent
,
fast
standard
-
setting
,
modernise
EU
procurement
rule
and
a
European
passport
for
venture
capital
fund
.
the
communication
also
note
progress
on
EU
financial
instrument
for
sme
through
Horizon
2020
and
the
programme
for
the
competitiveness
of
enterprise
and
sme
,
COSME
.
the
communication
state
that
the
global
position
of
Europe
be
still
relatively
strong
.
the
EU
be
one
of
the
world
's
good
performer
when
it
come
to
produce
high
quality
science
and
innovative
product
.
since
2008
,
the
EU
have
improve
its
innovation
performance
and
it
close
almost
half
of
the
innovation
gap
with
the
US
and
Japan
.
the
EU
be
also
keep
its
strong
innovation
lead
over
Brazil
,
India
,
Russia
and
China
,
although
the
last
be
catching
up
.
in
addition
,
South
Korea
have
almost
trip
its
innovation
lead
over
the
EU
since
2008
and
join
the
US
as
a
innovation
leader
.
also
,
while
public
research
and
development
spending
in
the
EU
grow
throughout
the
crisis
as
government
strive
to
keep
up
they
research
and
development
investment
and
incentivise
business
to
do
likewise
,
recent
datum
point
to
a
potential
reversal
of
this
trend
.
in
2011
,
for
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
the
crisis
,
the
total
public
research
and
development
budget
decrease
slightly
.
as
growth
disparity
between
some
European
region
be
increase
,
there
be
a
even
strong
need
to
implement
the
innovation
union
swiftly
,
particularly
in
the
area
crucial
to
innovation
,
such
as
high
education
,
innovation
-
base
entrepreneurship
and
demand
-
side
measure
.
a
new
indicator
of
innovation
output
have
be
develop
at
the
request
of
the
European
Council
to
benchmark
national
innovation
policy
and
monitor
the
EU
's
performance
against
its
main
trading
partner
.
the
new
indicator
classify
Ireland
in
the
high
category
of
top
performer
.
Ireland
's
performance
under
the
new
indicator
of
Innovation
output
be
highly
significant
as
it
measure
the
extent
to
which
idea
from
innovative
sector
be
able
to
reach
the
market
,
provide
good
job
and
make
Europe
more
competitive
.
this
be
a
very
positive
indication
of
improvement
in
Ireland
's
competitiveness
in
key
area
of
the
economy
.
the
top
performer
in
the
EU
owe
they
rank
to
do
well
on
several
or
all
of
the
follow
factor
:
a
economy
with
a
high
share
of
knowledge
-
intensive
sector
,
fast
-
grow
innovative
firm
,
high
level
of
patenting
,
and
competitive
export
.
the
novelty
of
the
new
indicator
be
that
it
focus
on
innovation
output
.
Sweden
,
Germany
,
that
be
fantastic
news
about
Kinsale
Community
College
.
it
be
a
testament
to
the
school
and
its
etho
.
it
be
also
a
testament
to
what
I
will
not
call
a
new
-
find
interest
in
STEM
but
a
grow
interest
in
engage
with
the
STEM
subject
-
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
.
there
be
a
fearlessness
among
student
now
at
post
-
primary
level
about
take
on
this
project
.
one
can
see
it
at
the
Young
Scientist
and
Technology
Exhibition
and
in
other
science
-
related
outreach
programme
that
be
take
place
with
industry
.
there
be
a
confidence
among
student
to
embrace
new
technology
.
they
be
digital
native
,
as
it
be
.
however
,
there
be
still
challenge
,
such
as
ensure
that
a
increase
number
of
student
will
engage
with
the
hard
science
such
as
physics
and
chemistry
.
we
must
try
to
ensure
there
will
be
a
throughput
so
this
people
will
have
the
necessary
skill
set
to
sloot
into
the
job
we
have
not
yet
even
imagine
,
as
deputy
Calleary
describe
they
.
I
join
in
the
congratulation
.
we
have
increase
the
target
for
engagement
by
sme
from
15
%
to
20
%
.
the
Horizon
2020
target
tally
with
the
current
policy
whereby
the
foreign
direct
investment
sector
and
SME
section
in
Ireland
very
much
have
a
opportunity
to
now
engage
with
the
research
infrastructure
.
where
a
challenge
be
present
by
a
sme
,
it
can
bring
that
challenge
to
a
research
entity
.
there
be
means
and
mechanism
for
funding
,
either
through
innovation
voucher
or
through
the
various
research
entity
to
bring
the
product
to
market
.
the
recent
announcement
of
the
€300
million
be
-
but
I
will
not
call
it
a
paradigm
shift
-
a
collaboration
that
involve
over
150
industry
partner
bring
a
€
100
million
in
cash
or
in
-
kind
contribution
that
be
match
with
a
€
200
million
state
investment
to
create
seven
new
SFI
research
centre
.
the
purpose
be
to
drive
innovation
and
allow
one
to
turn
good
idea
into
job
in
the
first
instance
.
also
,
one
can
ensure
that
we
will
have
a
throughput
,
focus
on
and
smartly
specialise
,
where
we
will
invest
for
the
next
five
to
ten
year
horizon
.
the
societal
challenge
contain
in
Horizon
2020
map
onto
we
own
priority
research
area
.
for
instance
,
we
have
identify
14
key
area
that
we
will
fund
.
then
industry
will
join
with
academia
to
create
the
new
research
entity
.
we
have
already
announce
quite
a
number
of
they
and
some
of
they
be
under
way
.
just
last
week
we
announce
the
enfant
centre
.
it
be
a
amalgamation
of
between
seven
to
ten
industry
partner
and
Cork
University
Maternity
Hospital
and
the
Royal
College
of
Surgeons
of
Ireland
.
some
of
its
work
will
be
the
development
of
perinatal
research
.
there
be
also
a
expectation
now
that
within
the
research
infrastructure
,
we
must
deliver
job
,
deliver
for
the
economy
and
deliver
new
innovation
for
society
.
a
clear
challenge
have
be
set
for
the
research
community
but
it
map
onto
the
same
challenge
inherent
in
Horizon
2020
.
a
specific
sme
target
have
be
set
for
research
but
the
challenge
be
how
to
get
the
sme
engage
.
let
we
say
one
have
a
traditional
sme
who
have
a
traditional
relationship
with
a
county
enterprise
board
,
for
example
,
or
soon
to
be
local
enterprise
office
.
how
do
we
get
they
to
start
engage
with
academia
in
a
way
to
get
leverage
from
research
innovation
on
the
product
?
how
do
we
convey
the
idea
that
the
SME
must
get
the
product
to
market
and
create
job
?
we
have
send
strong
signal
to
they
through
the
agency
such
as
Enterprise
Ireland
which
be
map
on
to
the
research
infrastructure
.
we
have
also
convey
the
message
through
the
various
research
entity
that
the
government
expect
to
have
a
more
proactive
engagement
with
sme
on
the
matter
.
I
hope
that
I
have
answer
the
question
.
its
not
easy
to
answer
and
I
can
only
focus
on
what
Ireland
be
do
.
Ireland
have
take
a
long
term
view
.
we
be
work
proactively
on
the
stem
side
and
education
.
the
latter
be
the
key
in
South
Korea
and
its
population
seem
to
be
natural
innovator
.
at
present
we
be
do
a
lot
of
work
on
,
for
instance
,
funding
out
-
of
-
field
mathematics
teacher
.
we
be
spend
a
considerable
amount
of
taxpayer
money
in
bring
the
out
-
of
-
field
math
teacher
and
upskil
they
with
a
professional
diploma
in
order
to
allow
they
to
teach
the
curriculum
and
so
on
.
we
be
now
talk
about
fund
continual
professional
development
at
primary
school
level
in
order
to
equip
teacher
to
teach
mathematics
.
sometimes
a
deficit
exist
.
sometimes
there
be
a
competition
in
primary
school
between
other
subject
and
mathematics
and
science
related
topic
.
there
be
outreach
project
such
as
the
Discover
Science
and
Engineering
programme
,
industry
engagement
and
Coder
Dojo
and
whatnot
.
we
must
start
think
long
term
.
we
must
analyse
how
we
train
teacher
to
teach
this
subject
and
find
out
whether
there
be
more
to
be
do
in
order
to
begin
challenge
other
region
like
Singapore
and
South
Korea
.
there
be
a
consciousness
around
that
goal
.
in
the
short
term
,
Ireland
be
not
in
a
position
to
fund
the
whole
gamut
of
research
.
we
must
be
smart
,
specialise
in
certain
area
and
ensure
that
we
do
not
leave
basic
research
out
of
the
loop
.
we
must
ensure
that
there
be
blue
sky
research
and
find
pocket
of
funding
to
invest
in
astrophysics
,
etc
.
I
be
not
say
that
we
be
put
all
of
we
egg
into
the
14
research
priority
area
because
one
must
include
the
humanity
,
social
science
,
digital
humanity
and
so
on
.
we
must
ensure
that
the
research
infrastructure
be
more
round
.
in
order
for
we
to
compete
with
region
like
Singapore
in
the
long
term
then
the
key
be
to
equip
the
teacher
of
science
and
mathematics
in
a
certain
way
.
the
output
be
student
who
be
drive
.
naturally
that
student
would
then
go
into
post
-
primary
education
and
then
on
to
course
at
tertiary
level
where
there
be
more
a
take
up
of
that
science
related
and
stem
related
subject
.
I
take
the
point
.
we
have
deliberately
set
out
target
and
increase
the
target
for
engagement
by
the
SME
sector
in
Horizon
2020
.
the
subject
of
today
's
committee
meeting
be
the
upcoming
Competitiveness
Council
.
the
challenge
,
as
deputy
Áine
Collins
say
,
be
to
engage
the
SME
sector
.
there
be
people
who
come
into
we
office
who
have
have
no
formal
engagement
,
who
have
great
idea
and
who
want
a
pathway
for
the
idea
so
that
they
can
monetise
it
,
commercialise
it
and
get
it
to
the
market
.
the
local
enterprise
office
should
present
a
opportunity
in
that
regard
.
more
outreach
must
be
do
by
academic
institution
.
there
must
be
great
flexibility
by
academic
institution
where
there
be
technology
transfer
office
or
centre
of
innovation
,
such
as
the
Rubicon
or
NIMBUS
centre
in
Cork
.
there
be
a
open
-
door
policy
in
that
centre
and
we
must
break
down
the
filtration
system
between
the
citizen
who
have
the
idea
and
the
academic
institution
.
there
should
be
a
more
flexible
approach
.
I
agree
with
the
deputy
in
that
regard
.
I
strongly
argue
that
it
can
be
do
once
the
local
enterprise
office
be
up
and
run
.
from
a
regional
perspective
,
the
local
enterprise
office
will
naturally
map
onto
the
exist
structure
because
of
the
service
level
agreement
within
Enterprise
Ireland
,
which
have
a
engagement
with
academic
institution
.
that
should
present
a
opportunity
to
people
so
that
they
do
not
get
bog
down
and
they
have
the
confidence
to
come
in
when
they
have
a
idea
.
tyre
can
be
kick
and
innovation
voucher
can
be
apply
to
the
idea
.
someone
from
the
research
community
can
engage
with
the
person
.
the
success
of
this
will
be
predicate
on
how
many
innovation
voucher
become
company
or
tradeable
or
commercialise
licence
.
we
have
some
way
to
go
in
this
country
.
I
take
the
point
be
make
.
deputy
Áine
Collins
refer
to
the
University
of
Maryland
.
Ireland
be
a
small
country
.
globally
speak
,
we
be
punch
above
we
weight
on
the
innovation
index
.
there
be
a
tendency
for
Irish
people
to
be
self
-
congratulatory
.
however
,
look
at
the
objective
metric
,
we
have
a
large
FDI
presence
,
with
parent
company
and
people
on
-
site
in
Ireland
.
invariably
,
the
leader
of
team
be
Irish
people
who
have
come
up
through
the
corporate
structure
.
that
Irish
people
be
allow
we
to
leverage
opportunity
with
academia
.
it
be
not
every
day
that
industry
will
come
up
with
€
100
million
in
hard
cash
or
contribution
in
kind
and
marry
it
with
a
investment
from
the
State
.
we
will
never
compete
with
the
Unite
State
because
it
can
fund
through
philanthropy
and
a
whole
realm
of
funding
mechanism
,
include
blue
-
sky
research
.
we
must
specialise
and
we
must
be
smart
about
where
we
invest
.
we
have
collaborate
with
industry
and
we
have
develop
a
set
of
area
we
can
fund
,
which
will
deliver
for
the
economy
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
.
on
that
point
,
every
institute
of
technology
in
this
country
have
a
technology
centre
,
which
be
base
on
the
same
philosophy
as
the
rto
to
which
deputy
Collins
refer
.
there
be
competency
centre
which
be
manage
through
Enterprise
Ireland
which
be
very
much
focus
on
commercialisation
of
research
and
there
be
also
the
large
Science
Foundation
Ireland
centre
.
it
might
not
be
any
harm
for
this
committee
to
invite
some
people
from
Enterprise
Ireland
in
to
map
out
exactly
where
the
research
centre
and
the
competency
centre
be
and
to
provide
a
overarching
picture
for
the
member
.
Enterprise
Ireland
could
also
give
member
a
overview
of
the
theme
and
how
the
research
be
be
fund
.
on
the
issue
of
innovation
voucher
,
one
must
remember
that
we
be
talk
about
taxpayer
money
.
deputy
Collins
do
make
the
point
that
probity
be
necessary
from
that
perspective
.
I
can
understand
the
point
make
about
the
bureaucratic
nature
of
the
process
.
ultimately
,
we
be
try
to
get
to
a
point
where
company
which
be
often
family
company
or
inter-generational
company
in
area
such
as
engineering
or
manufacturing
,
come
into
the
research
system
.
we
be
try
to
de
construct
the
filtration
system
that
exist
between
academia
and
business
so
that
there
be
a
confluence
between
the
two
.
it
work
very
well
in
some
part
of
the
country
but
not
so
well
in
other
part
.
it
be
about
create
a
open
-
door
policy
whereby
a
potential
entrepreneur
can
sit
down
with
a
researcher
and
if
there
be
a
new
widget
to
be
develop
,
for
example
,
the
process
can
be
seamless
.
we
be
aim
to
reach
a
point
where
the
facilitation
take
place
seamlessly
.
if
the
idea
do
not
fly
,
then
so
be
it
.
if
it
do
,
then
it
can
be
fund
in
a
flexible
way
to
get
it
to
the
next
stage
.
that
be
the
system
we
be
try
to
work
towards
.
this
be
a
co-decision
procedure
so
effectively
it
involve
negotiation
between
over
700
mep
and
,
at
the
time
,
27
member
state
and
the
commission
.
one
of
the
area
on
which
the
Commission
and
the
Council
of
Minister
,
represent
by
myself
,
have
a
very
stringent
view
be
on
the
need
for
simplification
.
the
process
have
to
be
simplify
.
the
manner
in
which
researcher
and
industry
engage
with
Horizon
2020
have
to
be
such
that
there
be
a
simplification
of
the
procedure
for
application
.
there
be
a
tendency
for
the
large
research
infrastructure
throughout
Europe
to
have
a
major
administrative
function
build
into
they
silo
,
for
want
of
a
good
term
,
such
that
they
have
a
comparative
advantage
over
other
.
they
be
already
well
equip
to
deal
with
the
bureaucracy
involve
in
the
funding
application
process
.
we
be
create
a
flat
structure
around
that
now
and
that
be
agree
politically
and
build
into
the
new
Horizon
2020
.
that
point
be
duly
note
.
I
will
relay
it
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
.
as
we
speak
,
new
innovation
be
be
create
by
the
Irish
Maritime
and
Energy
resource
cluster
as
part
of
its
work
with
Commodore
Mark
Mellett
and
the
entire
Naval
Service
,
which
be
fund
through
the
public
purse
and
have
its
headquarters
at
Haulbowline
,
and
its
engagement
with
University
College
Cork
and
Cork
Institute
of
Technology
.
there
be
a
role
for
think
about
how
the
Irish
Defence
Force
interact
with
the
SME
sector
.
a
number
of
company
be
be
scale
out
of
the
activity
of
the
Irish
Maritime
and
Energy
resource
cluster
at
Ringaskiddy
,
in
term
of
meet
the
need
of
the
navy
in
area
like
fishery
patrol
,
drone
and
earth
observation
through
the
European
Space
Agency
.
the
navy
interact
with
civilian
society
,
and
protect
civilian
society
,
in
all
sort
of
innovative
area
.
one
can
drive
new
innovation
from
that
activity
as
well
.
I
be
try
to
read
between
the
line
of
what
Senator
Cullinane
say
about
the
south
east
without
misinterpret
what
he
say
.
the
telecomumication
,
software
and
system
group
be
extremely
well
fund
not
because
it
be
base
in
Waterford
but
because
it
do
excellent
research
.
some
people
have
claim
that
there
be
a
regional
disparity
and
that
funding
go
into
the
university
but
not
into
the
region
.
I
would
contend
that
one
have
to
fund
first
and
foremost
on
the
basis
of
the
excellence
of
the
science
and
the
research
that
be
be
conduct
.
that
be
a
rule
of
thumb
in
research
funding
.
if
one
be
to
shift
the
balance
towards
the
provision
of
funding
in
this
area
on
the
basis
of
regional
disparity
,
one
would
be
go
down
a
very
narrow
cul
-
de-sac
.
Senator
Cullinane
refer
specifically
to
the
landscape
in
the
south
east
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
the
telecomumication
,
software
and
system
group
have
already
leverage
approximately
€
13
million
under
the
seventh
EU
framework
programme
.
that
be
a
testament
to
the
people
who
be
there
.
the
fact
that
they
be
in
Waterford
be
incidental
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
award
worth
€
7.47
million
have
be
make
in
the
south
east
.
it
be
a
strategic
research
cluster
,
as
the
Senator
will
know
.
a
infrastructure
award
of
€
1.9
million
be
make
in
2012
.
I
be
in
the
area
two
week
ago
.
I
maintain
a
close
working
relationship
with
the
principal
figure
in
all
the
research
entity
because
I
like
to
know
what
be
go
on
.
the
telecomumication
,
software
and
system
group
unquestionably
stand
out
as
a
beacon
.
I
be
conscious
of
the
need
to
ensure
the
group
continue
to
evolve
so
that
it
can
create
new
partnership
and
collaboration
with
industry
.
I
do
not
want
to
suggest
that
it
need
to
be
protect
.
I
think
the
deputy
answer
he
own
question
when
he
speak
about
the
group
's
engagement
with
sme
.
we
investment
in
research
be
predicate
on
that
model
of
innovation
,
which
be
take
place
throughout
the
country
.
I
would
like
to
respond
to
the
point
that
be
make
about
the
public
sector
by
say
that
research
scientist
be
invariably
public
sector
worker
.
many
of
the
fund
we
award
be
use
to
meet
the
cost
of
overhead
in
term
of
human
capital
.
I
be
go
to
come
to
that
point
in
term
of
the
overall
answer
.
it
go
back
to
the
point
deputy
Áine
Collins
be
make
early
.
many
sme
that
operate
in
the
technology
sector
be
already
well
verse
because
they
be
bear
out
of
academic
institution
.
Radisen
Diagnostics
in
Cork
have
develop
innovation
in
the
area
of
point
-
of
-
care
blood
testing
.
this
be
a
example
of
a
company
that
be
gradually
scaling
up
and
ramp
up
to
sme
level
.
as
it
be
bear
within
a
academic
institution
,
it
be
predicate
on
excellent
research
.
it
will
use
the
level
that
be
available
through
Horizon
2020
to
access
great
funding
.
as
the
OECD
have
point
out
,
it
be
a
big
challenge
to
get
more
traditional
type
of
sme
-
the
Momma
and
Poppa
intergenerational
company
in
the
more
traditional
sector
-
to
engage
.
I
acknowledge
it
be
a
challenge
.
I
be
confident
we
can
do
it
.
I
believe
the
local
enterprise
office
can
serve
as
a
mechanism
to
enable
we
to
do
so
.
if
one
examine
this
from
a
regional
perspective
,
one
will
reflect
on
the
role
play
by
the
county
enterprise
board
.
there
be
a
service
level
agreement
with
Enterprise
Ireland
.
the
chance
be
that
Enterprise
Ireland
be
fund
many
of
the
company
that
be
bear
out
of
the
research
landscape
.
Enterprise
Ireland
be
conscious
that
it
have
a
direct
mandate
and
a
mission
to
deal
with
the
sme
sector
and
the
indigenous
sector
.
I
think
we
will
address
that
dynamic
through
that
process
.
I
be
confident
about
that
.
most
of
the
great
innovation
we
know
about
have
come
from
investment
in
defence
.
we
constitutional
arrangement
govern
where
we
own
defence
infrastructure
sit
relative
to
the
world
and
relative
to
the
Unite
Nation
.
deputy
Áine
Collins
refer
to
Israel
early
.
the
great
innovation
that
have
come
from
Israel
be
predicate
on
that
country
's
massive
investment
in
its
defence
sector
.
the
same
thing
apply
to
the
Unite
State
of
America
.
we
have
a
clear
mandate
that
dictate
what
we
can
and
cannot
fund
.
there
be
no
question
about
that
.
we
be
not
fund
people
to
make
weapon
-
we
be
fund
innovation
in
microelectronic
.
it
may
be
the
case
that
a
piece
of
innovation
can
be
apply
to
defence
infrastructure
as
a
by
-
product
.
I
will
leave
it
hang
there
.
that
be
probably
wise
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
he
official
for
attend
this
meeting
.
I
wish
they
the
good
of
luck
at

the
Competitiveness
Council

will
defer
consideration
of
housekeeping
matter
until

I
be
very
pleased
to
have
the
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
member
of
the
joint
committee
on
the
research
and
development
landscape
in
Ireland
.
I
thank
they
for
invite
I
to
do
so
.
the
importance
of
investment
in
science
,
technology
and
innovation
to
Ireland
's
ongoing
and
future
economic
and
social
development
and
wellbeing
have
be
well
recognise
by
this
and
previous
government
.
we
focus
have
be
very
much
on
prioritise
public
investment
in
research
while
well
exploit
result
in
order
to
lead
to
a
acceleration
of
growth
and
job
creation
.
over
the
past
decade
we
have
expand
and
consolidate
we
research
and
innovation
system
considerably
and
investment
in
research
and
innovation
have
grow
substantially
.
this
investment
have
be
base
on
a
ambitious
strategy
of
invest
in
people
,
infrastructure
and
associate
facility
to
build
the
science
base
across
many
area
of
scientific
research
in
both
the
high
education
institution
and
other
public
research
organisation
,
notably
through
the
Programme
for
Research
in
third
Level
Institution
,
PRTLI
,
as
well
as
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
other
research
agency
.
this
investment
in
scientific
research
be
have
many
positive
impact
,
include
power
a
innovative
and
enterprising
economy
,
create
high
-
value
job
,
attract
,
develop
and
nurture
business
,
scientist
and
talented
people
and
ensure
Ireland
be
connect
and
respect
internationally
.
we
can
draw
much
encouragement
from
the
fact
that
Ireland
have
enhance
its
standing
in
global
research
by
steadily
build
a
very
credible
research
base
,
particularly
over
the
past
decade
or
so
.
we
publication
rate
have
double
,
for
example
,
with
Ireland
's
citation
rate
now
surpass
EU
and
US
average
.
Ireland
be
now
rank
in
the
global
top
20
in
all
scientific
field
and
,
specifically
,
by
way
of
example
we
be
rank
first
in
molecular
genetics
,
and
genomics
,
second
in
probiotic
,
third
in
immunology
,
sixth
in
nanotechnology
,
eighth
in
material
science
and
tenth
in
computer
science
.
across
the
EU
we
be
rank
third
,
accord
to
the
new
indication
of
innovation
output
,
which
measure
the
extent
to
which
idea
from
innovative
sector
be
able
to
reach
the
market
,
provide
good
job
and
make
Europe
more
competitive
.
this
prove
we
be
invest
smartly
in
this
area
and
that
we
investment
be
deliver

and

I
hope
that
I
have
touch
on
the
more
salient
point
.
the
government
recognise
that
research
,
development
and
innovation
form
a
major
plank
and
we
be
smartly
invest
in
and
prioritise
key
area
.
we
be
leverage
industry
involvement
,
bring
in
-
kind
benefit
and
cash
to
the
table
,
in
partnership
with
we
research
infrastructure
in
a
way
that
will
deliver
a
economic
impact
.
this
be
the
kernel
of
we
approach
.
I
will
do
my
good
to
answer
as
coherently
as
possible
.
if
I
miss
something
,
the
chairman
will
pull
I
up
on
it
.
the
central
aim
be
to
maximise
job
creation
.
the
investment
by
successive
government
in
research
,
development
and
innovation
be
recognise
.
less
than
20
year
ago
,
we
capacity
be
much
less
than
it
be
now
and
that
government
have
the
vision
to
build
it
.
we
be
now
at
a
juncture
.
we
have
a
highly
evolve
infrastructure
in
which
that
in
the
orient
,
basic
research
landscape
and
that
in
the
apply
space
co-exist
well
.
in
term
of
the
potential
for
maximise
job
creation
,
we
have
design
a
infrastructure
that
be
supra-institutional
.
traditionally
,
the
university
and
institute
of
technology
operate
inside
they
own
silo
and
collaborate
on
specific
programme
that
have
thematic
area
of
interest
,
for
example
,
pharma
.
we
have
put
together
a
fund
through
SFI
under
which
the
seven
new
centre
that
have
be
create
must
collaborate
outside
of
they
traditional
institutional
framework
.
we
have
identify
14
area
,
include
big
datum
and
datum
analytic
.
we
have
co-principal
investigator
,
co-pis
,
from
six
,
if
not
seven
,
institution
.
the
potential
for
job
creation
lie
in
the
industrial
engagement
.
I
cannot
give
the
deputy
a
exact
figure
of
the
number
of
industrial
partner
in
a
entity
,
but
the
investment
of
the
industry
's
money
in
this
new
infrastructure
be
be
do
with
a
view
to
deliver
a
economic
impact
,
by
which
I
mean
job
creation
.
the
philosophy
have
be
to
create
the
seven
new
infrastructure
with
more
to
come
this
year
,
to
accrue
in
-
kind
benefit
-
people
from
industry
or
cash
investment
-
and
to
get
the
scientific
community
to
act
above
its
traditional
institution
on
specific
theme
and
create
a
vital
economic
impact
.
the
Horizon
2020
target
investment
be
attainable
.
by
create
new
,
large
-
scale
infrastructure
that
supersede
individual
institution
and
by
attract
156
industry
partner
and
€
100

,
one
create
a

that
put
one
in
a
strong
position
vis-à
-
vis
the
€
80
billion
available
in
the
Horizon

pot
.
while

or
any
other
institution
that
the
deputy
care
to
mention
may
have
be

7
in
its
own
right
,

strengthen
one
's
leverage
position
.
therefore
,
one
's
ability
to
attain
the
target
become
more
realistic
.
the
investment
in
research
,
development
and
innovation
be
primarily
a
investment
in
human
capital
,
for
example
,
excellent
scientist
.
I
do
not
have
a
exact
breakdown
of
how
much
have
go
towards
brick
and
mortar
,
equipment
or
human
capacity
.
by
and
large
,
it
be
about
investment
in
the
very
good
people
in
the
world
in
order
to
create
impact
.
a
review
of
patent
be
currently
under
way
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
of
the
technology
transfer
strengthen
initiative
.
a
review
of
patent
under
that
initiative
be
currently
under
way
.
we
have
create
a
infrastructure
which
include
a
central
technology
transfer
officer
and
Enterprise
Ireland
support
technology
transfer
officer
,
tto
,
in
the
individual
institution
,
all
of
whom
be
task
with
pull
out
that
intellectual
property
and
create
from
it
the
economic
opportunity
arise
for
economic
or
societal
benefit
.
let
we
take
,
for
example
,
business
investment
in
research
and
development
.
during
period
of
economic
downturn
,
it
be
less
likely
that
company
will
engage
in
research
and
development
because
of
the
cost
element
.
in
other
word
,
during
period
of
retrenchment
company
will
engage
in
a
battening
down
of
the
hatch
.
there
be
a
direct
correlation
between
that
and
the
reduction
in
the
number
of
patent
.
this
be
be
address
through
the
national
research
prioritisation
exercise
.
let
we
imagine
we
have
all
of
the
research
funder
in
one
room
go
through
action
plan
for
each
of
the
priority
area
.
work
with
Forfás
,
we
have
set
out
metric
in
term
of
how
the
institution
should
perform
,
in
particular
that
fund
through
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
.
I
anticipate
a
behavioural
change
in
this
regard
from
the
institution
in
the
context
of
what
the
State
expect
from
they
in
term
of
job
creation
.
the
usual
measure
within
academia
be
the
number
of
publication
and
citation
.
we
be
drive
new
metric
in
relation
to
job
,
patent
and
licence
number
,
etc
.
there
be
a
clear
expectation
among
the
research
community
in
term
of
what
government
expect
of
it
.
a
review
of
the
patent
be
,
as
I
say
,
under
way
through
the
technology
transfer
strengthen
initiative
.
the
dip
in
economic
activity
-----
yes
,
it
be
.
I
apologise
if
I
do
not
answer
that
question
correctly
.
the
funding
be
tie
down
.
commitment
have
be
give
.
there
be
potential
for
further
industrial
engagement
.
for
instance
,
in
term
of
the
seven
centre
across
the
seven
seam
that
have
be
create
,
there
be
further
scope
for
industry
to
tack
on
to
that
.
we
have
create
a
type
of
hub
and
speak
model
.
in
term
of
the
current
landscape
,
we
be
move
into
the
apply
space
.
there
be
great
flexibility
be
create
in
term
of
how
industry
map
on
to
or
partner
with
academia
in
relation
to
create
spin-out
and
so
on
.
I
do
not
know
if
we
can
compare
ourselves
to
Israel
per
se
.
account
must
be
take
of
the
manner
in
which
Israel
do
its
business
through
government
investment
or
external
investment
,
which
be
quite
heavy
in
research
,
development
and
innovation
.
it
be
very
well
finance
and
resource
.
there
be
also
a
lot
more
freedom
inherent
within
that
system
for
individual
researcher
to
draw
down
pot
of
money
.
they
also
have
flexibility
in
term
of
how
that
money
be
use
.
we
do
not
have
that
freedom
because
of
the
economic
constraint
on
we
.
we
be
move
to
a
system
which
ensure
that
technology
transfer
be
not
carry
out
in
a
haphazard
manner
.
I
be
not
suggest
that
up
to
now
it
have
be
carry
out
in
that
way
.
however
,
sometimes
technology
transfer
within
individual
institution
could
be
a
matter
of
whether
I
,
as
the
technology
transfer
officer
,
have
a
positive
or
negative
relationship
with
a
individual
principal
investigator
.
we
be
try
to
disrupt
that
dynamic
positively
.
bring
in
the
156
industry
partner
mean
that
dynamic
cannot
but
be
positively
disrupt
.
this
be
because
the
industry
be
invest
its
own
money
in
thematic
area
such
as
,
for
instance
,
the
pharmaceutical
sector
,
particularly
in
Ireland
in
the
context
of
the
move
from
what
be
call
molecule
to
medicine
,
which
sector
be
partner
with
academia
to
sustain
job
already
in
the
system
while
create
new
innovation
in
relation
to
how
medicine
be
deliver
,
thus
send
the
message
from
Ireland
's
pharma
sector
to
parent
company
that
the
Irish
government
be
not
only
serious
about
maintain
investment
in
pharma
here
,
but
also
in
leverage
new
opportunity
to
strengthen
that
individual
entity
relative
to
the
mothership
.
that
be
part
of
the
philosophy
,
which
I
accept
do
not
necessarily
answer
the
deputy
's
question
.
by
set
clear
metric
we
be
set
clear
expectation
.
if
this
expectation
be
not
deliver
upon
,
the
State
agency
or
taxpayer
then
have
to
review
the
operation
of
each
of
the
centre
.
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
that
.
I
hope
I
have
answer
the
deputy
's
question
.
if
not
,
he
may
challenge
I
further
.
some
40
%
of
foreign
direct
investment
win
be
predicate
on
relationship
with
Science
Foundation
Ireland
.
by
any
standard
,
40
%
be
a
significant
amount
.
more
than
40
%
of
IDA
new
client
win
in
2012
have
direct
link
with
Science
Foundation
Ireland
fund
researcher
.
that
translate
into
4500
job
,
which
I
contend
be
not
insignificant
.
if
one
look
at
the
metric
-
I
refer
to
licence
,
option
or
assignment
agreement
-
and
at
the
trajectory
from
2006
to
2013
,
there
be
a
dip
between
2011
and
2012
but
we
be
now
back
up
.
in
2011
,
the
figure
be
118
,
in
2012
,
it
be
87
and
in
2013
,
although
this
be
only
a
provisional
figure
,
it
be
120
.
in
regard
to
spin-out
,
the
indicative
figure
for
2013
be
34
,
which
be
the
high
it
have
be
since
2006
.
there
be
a
dip
in
regard
to
invention
disclosure
and
in
patent
.
licensing
be
something
which
one
be
monetise
.
it
be
a
income
stream
.
I
agree
that
we
want
to
see
more
spin-out
come
from
the
investment
in
research
.
we
have
lay
down
very
clear
expectation
in
regard
to
the
investment
the
taxpayer
be
make
.
if
industry
make
investment
,
it
must
ensure
there
be
a
return
on
its
investment
.
I
agree
with
the
tenet
of
the
point
but
we
be
take
very
concrete
step
to
engage
.
I
probably
will
not
be
able
to
deal
with
all
of
they
,
but
the
committee
can
revert
to
I
.
on
the
question
of
target
,
the
commission
allow
member
state
to
set
they
target
in
line
with
condition
.
I
know
there
be
a
aspirational
target
set
for
2020
and
ideally
we
would
like
to
be
hit
it
,
but
current
condition
do
not
allow
we
to
do
that
.
small
country
have
to
be
smart
and
specialise
in
very
specific
area
of
opportunity
.
I
think
that
be
what
we
be
do
.
we
have
identify
14
core
area
,
and
food
be
identify
as
a
national
priority
.
already
one
of
the
new
SFI
centre
be
very
much
map
on
to
the
potential
for
food
.
the
Alimentary
Pharmabiotic
Centre
,
APC
,
be
a

by
Professor
Fergus

and

of

.
they
be
explore
the
next
wave
of
opportunity
in
the
area
of
food
,
probiotic
and
functional
food
.
they
be
currently
map
the
human
digestive
tract
at
microbial
level
with
a
view
to
distinguish
between
the
good
and
bad
bacterium
and
create
medicinal
product
that
will
be
vital
to
sustain
humanity
.
they
work
have
a
global
focus
.
the
researcher
from
Teagasc
,
the
dairy
and
pharma
industry
be
map
into
the
activity
.
we
be
focus
on
the
next
wave
of
potential
in
area
such
as
food
,
pharma
and
medical
device
.
this
be
we
inherent
core
strength
and
will
allow
we
to
compete
with
industry
in
other
country
,
such
as
New

.
we
be
lag
behind
Singapore
in
term
of
the
delivery
of
education
,
particularly
in
relation
to
stem
subject
,
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
.
we
have
programme
such
as
the
"
smart
Future
"
and
"
Discover
"
.
there
be
flexibility
in
the
new
junior

curriculum
to
introduce
stem

in
my
role
in
the
Department
of
Education

I
have
responsibility
for
the

all
STEM
activity
throughout
the
country
,
whether
it
be
industrial
engagement
,
the
National
Council
for
Curriculum
and
Assessment
,
NCCA
or
the
State
agency
deliver
education
.
if
we
can
collate
all
of
the
activity
,
we
can
then
create
a
impact
through
the
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
by
inculcate
a
even
great
sense
of
the
potential
of
education
in
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
in
term
of
the
job
that
need
to
be
create
downstream
.
I
have
a
real
personal
interest
in
pedagogical
research
.
the
primary
school
teacher
have
to
be
give
the
skill
set
and
have
the
tool
that
allow
they
to
have
complete
confidence
to
teach
mathematics
and
science
related
subject
.
teacher
at
primary
school
level
have
to
teach
across
a
myriad
of
subject
.
a
idea
emanate
from
the
STEM
committee
be
the
need
to
spend
more
on
research
to
assist
teacher
so
that
we
can
achieve
high
score
on
the
PISA
and
other
international
rank
test
and
to
adopt
the
methodology
that
be
inherent
in
place
such
as
Singapore
,
Finland
and
Estonia
.
that
will
allow
we
to
create
economic
opportunity
down
stream
and
enable
we
to
compete
with
other
centre
.
that
be
the
philosophy
that
be
guide
we
.
the
review
group
will
report
to
I
very
soon
.
I
will
now
respond
to
the
question
on
the
region
.
Senator
Cullinane
mention
TSSG
,
Telecommunications
Software
&
System
Group
.
one
only
have
to
look
at
how
many
successful
application
that
have
come
from
TSSG
,
a
company
form
as
part
of
the
Waterford
Institute
of
Technology
,
in
the
south
east
,
to
see
how
well
they
have
do
on
FP7
.
they
have
do
very
well
because
there
be
excellent
people
in
TSSG
.
what
must
drive
research
and
development
be
excellence
and
not
regional
consideration
.
I
take
the
point
that
have
be
make
about
baseline
funding
.
the
call
from
SFI
be
open
to
any
institution
and
be
base
on
the
ability
of
the
institution
to
attract
the
right
personnel
.
I
be
very
familiar
with
the
work
that
be
go
on
in
Cork
Institute
of
Technology
,
CIT
,
and
how
the
iot
compete
with
the
university
.
the
recent
Irish
Photonics
Centre
be
lead
by
the
Tyndall
National
Institute
comprise
ucc
and
CIT
.
the
excellent
research
base
in
light
and
photonics
in
CIT
have
allow
it
become
academic
partner
and
win
when
the
call
be
put
out
by
SFI
.
the
process
of
create
a
technological
university
be
under
way
.
the
issue
of
baseline
funding
will
have
to
be
tease
out
.
the
target
for
research
perform
organisation
be
set
out
and
we
have
map
out
where
SFI
,
the
Health
Research
Board
and
Teagasc
spend
money
.
we
have
conduct
a
research
prioritisation
exercise
and
establish
the
priority
.
if
we
be
to
set
out
what
we
call
compact
for
each
institution
in
term
of
performance
,
we
must
have
a
level
playing
field
.
a
research
entity
may
have
expectation
but
in
the
case
of
a
dearth
of
baseline
funding
,
the
question
of
performance
have
to
be
consider
in
the
light
of
circumstance
.
let
I
sound
a
warning
and
say
,
without
prejudice
,
that
this
be
still
a
evolve
process
.
it
must
happen
in
a
collaborative
way
and
through
a
conciliatory
process
.
some
of
the
issue
have
still
to
be
tease
out
.
deputy
Áine
yes
.
we
be
alive
to
the
challenge
that
be
be
voice
.
the
Department
be
currently
examine
all
the
issue
and
look
at
all
of
the
option
in
term
of
Ireland
's
participation
in
the
unified
patent
court
.
one
must
look
at
the
implication
of
each
policy
option
and
one
must
look
at
cost
.
there
be
probably
other
issue
that
may
apply
to
individual
or
certain
representative
organisation
,
which
Senator
Cullinane
be
refer
to
in
term
of
the
lobbying
on
this
issue
.
one
must
have
due
regard
for
the
position
that
be
be
put
forward
by
various
entity
and
they
view
have
to
be
take
into
account
.
on
the
assertion
of
a
"
yes
,
minister
"
response
,
I
be
a
minister
of
State
and
I
be
give
the
answer
from
the
horse
's
mouth
.
to
be
frank
,
one
must
take
all
view
into
account
.
that
be
currently
under
way
.
I
be
give
the
Senator
a
straight
answer
.
we
be
not
blind
to
the
issue
.
the
official
who
be
lead
by
Ms
Anne
Coleman
Dunne
be
very
proactive
in
this
area
.
there
be
absolutely
no
deadline
in
respect
of
this
issue
.
yes
,
absolutely
.
I
will
not
express
a
personal
view
on
it
.
I
be
wait
for
that
.
let
I
respond
to
Senator
Clune
first
.
Industry
have
always
be
a
partner
with
academia
on
output
from
research
,
be
it
economic
,
development
or
specific
industrial
or
sme
need
.
the
creation
of
the
SFI
centre
have
see
industry
put
up
significant
resource
in
kind
and
in
hard
cash
contribution
so
industry
be
very
much
take
a
punt
and
become
active
stakeholder
in
this
process
.
the
€100
million
be
a
direct
investment
by
industry
-
with
two
third
come
from
the
taxpayer
and
one
third
from
industry
.
if
one
look
at
the
revision
to
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
,
we
have
try
to
improve
the
system
in
a
way
that
allow
for
a
increase
in
the
amount
of
expenditure
on
what
we
call
a
full
volume
basis
.
it
use
to
be
base
on
a
base
year
but
now
we
be
increase
the
limit
from
€
200000
to
€
300000
.
we
be
try
to
encourage
more
sme
to
participate
in
research
and
development
.
we
have
put
in
place
a
increase
,
from
10
%
to
15
%
,
in
the
limit
on
the
amount
of
qualifying
research
and
development
expenditure
that
can
be
outsource
to
another
company
.
if
one
examine
the
OECD
average
on
the
balance
between
public
and
private
investment
,
we
be
ahead
of
the
average
.
if
one
consider
the
OECD
average
as
a
universally
accept
metric
,
we
be
do
well
.
I
hope
that
answer
the
question
.
we
be
examine
the
option
and
engage
with
the
stakeholder
.
a
agreement
be
reach
in
February
2013
.
we
have
a
decision
to
make
on
Ireland
's
position
with
regard
to
a
local
or
out
-
of
-
state
court
,
and
that
decision
will
be
make
in
due
course
.
the
process
of
engage
with
stakeholder
be
arguably
still
ongoing
.
on
CERN
,
I
make
the
point
that
the
European
Space
Agency
,
ESA
,
be
not
often
hear
about
in
the
public
domain
.
if
one
be
to
measure
the
column
inch
on
the
ESA
versus
CERN
,
CERN
would
garner
many
more
inch
.
however
,
if
one
consider
we
membership
of
ESA
,
a
area
for
which
I
have
particular
policy
responsibility
,
we
have
carry
out
a
analysis
of
we
investment
of
€
17
million
and
find
it
have
directly
impact
on
turnover
to
the
tune
of
some
€
250
million
for
Irish
and
FDI
-
related
company
because
it
have
allow
that
company
to
win
contract
.
for
example
,
Radisen
Diagnostics
be
a
company
that
,
through
its
engagement
with
the
ESA
,
have
win
significant
funding
nationally
and
be
now
win
serious
funding
round
internationally
.
the
position
be
similar
with
Treemetrics
,
a
company
that
have
also
win
grant
aid
from
the
ESA
and
a
company
this
committee
might
be
more
familiar
with
in
term
of
the
impact
it
be
create
in
regard
to
global
forestry
solution
.
it
have
be
say
we
can
get
a
associate
membership
of
CERN
for
€
1
million
.
the
reason
we
be
carry
out
the
review
be
that
we
need
to
kick
the
tyre
on
that
statement
.
we
be
carry
out
a
review
of
we
membership
of
all
international
organisation
.
however
,
it
be
only
fair
,
if
we
be
carry
out
a
review
of
we
membership
,
to
do
so
in
the
good
interest
of
the
taxpayer
,
which
have
to
be
the
bottom
line
in
all
of
this
.
the
question
in
my
mind
,
give
there
be
now
a
campaign
,
which
we
all
welcome
,
be
whether
it
be
the
case
that
individual
researcher
be
barr
from
access
CERN
as
a
facility
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
Ireland
have
not
pay
its
€
1
million
associate
membership
.
I
have
not
see
any
evidence
to
suggest
they
be
barr
.
as
I
understand
it
,
although
I
stand
to
be
correct
,
individual
academic
institution
can
pay
a
particular
fee
,
whatever
that
be
,
or
they
might
have
a
arrangement
with
a
external
university
which
will
allow
Irish
researcher
access
to
the
facility
of
CERN
.
we
be
be
very
honest
about
we
approach
on
this
and
we
have
a
open
mind
on
it
.
before
make
the
decision
to
invest
€
17
million
in
the
ESA
,
we
undertake
a
economic
analysis
.
it
be
only
fair
that
we
undertake
a
economic
analysis
and
,
potentially
,
a
societal
analysis
of
the
impact
of
we
membership
of
CERN
.
to
be
fair
,
while
I
do
not
want
to
be
facetious
,
I
have
hear
it
say
that
CERN
have
be
great
for
humanity
and
it
have
bring
we
the
Internet
.
however
,
the
Internet
be
come
anyway
,
and
it
be
not
certain
whether
we
would
have
have
a
influence
on
that
,
or
perhaps
there
be
Irish
researcher
already
there
who
have
a
influence
.
if
we
spend
€
1
million
on
associate
membership
or
€
12
million
on
full
membership
,
will
it
have
a
quantitative
impact
on
we
interaction
with
CERN
?
that
be
the
question
that
have
to
be
ask
.
I
believe
we
should
have
the
review
.
I
take
absolute
cognisance
of
the
bona
fide
of
that
who
be
campaign
on
this
issue
.
they
be
excellent
researcher
who
be
part
of
international
consortia
which
have
access
to
CERN
.
however
,
the
question
have
to
be
ask
what
be
the
benefit
in
real
term
and
what
kind
of
contract
will
Ireland
get
from
it
.
I
would
like
to
look
at
country
of
a
comparable
size
to
Ireland
and
see
what
benefit
they
have
derive
from
they
membership
of
CERN
in
term
of
various
contract
.
the
deputy
raise
this
point
the
last
day
.
be
it
in
regard
to
the
European
Research
Infrastructures
?
be
that
the
specific
area
?
we
already
have
a
interest
in
some
48
European
Research
infrastructure
project
.
we
might
need
to
tease
it
out
more
.
it
be
ESFRI
,
which
deal
with
nuclear
research
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
I
now
fully
understand
the
point
.
yes
,
we
be
look
at
it
.
it
may
not
be
music
to
the
deputy
's
ear
to
say
that
we
be
look
at
the
marine
area
.
we
be
look
at
it
.
I
know
it
be
a
bit
of
a
cliche
but
if
the
deputy
want
to
put
down
a
parliamentary
question
at
some
stage
,
it
would
keep
we
active
and
keep
the
fire
lighting
on
the
issue
.
that
be
good
news
from
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and

colleague

they

with
regard
to
the
indigenous

,
there
be
many
centre
of
excellence
within
the

ucc
,
for
example
,
be
do
considerable
work
through

for
Health
Ireland
,
a
initiative
that
involve
collaboration
between
the
dairy
industry
and
Teagasc
in
Moorepark
in
Fermoy
,
for
instance
.
the
objective
be
to
build
on
extract
value
from
milk
.
much
research
be
be
do
in
this
regard
.
there
be
collaboration
between
Teagasc
,
ucc
,
UCD
and
UL
to
determine
how
to
build
functional
food
and
add
nutritional
value
to

this
work
be
take
place
in
the
indigenous
base

NUIG
have
the
Competence
Centre
for
Biorefining
and
Bioenergy
,
which
be
research
second
-
generation
bio-fuel
.
the
key
component
be
the
Programme
for
Research
in
third
-
Level
Institution
,
PRTLI
,
and
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
which
provide
funding
.
there
be
very
strong
engagement
between
this
body
and
industry
.
in
real
economic
term
,
investment
in
research
allow
this
country
to
compete
with
other
centre
of
excellence
,
include
global
one
such
as
Singapore
,
and
become
a
world
leader
.
it
be
not
often
publicise
that
research
and
collaboration
between
industry
and
the
institute
allow
we
to
support
export
from
we
economy
value
at
approximately
€
73
billion
.
since
2005
,
foreign
direct
investment
in
research
,
development
and
innovation
increase
from
approximately
10
%
to
approximately
50
%
.
there
be
a
highly
evolve
realisation
globally
that
the
company
operate
in
Ireland
through
collaboration
realise
they
be
able
to
mine
much
more
value
out
of
the
arrangement
,
and
that
this
be
add
to
we
export
base
.
however
,
we
must
continue
to
invest
because
,
if
investment
slip
,
we
could
signal
to
the
rest
of
the
world
that
Ireland
be
take
its
foot
off
the
pedal
in
term
of
investment
in
very
high
-
level
research
.
there
be
a
logical
component
that
ensure
we
can
support
between
72000
and
78000
job
.
we
need
to
continue
on
that
trajectory
.
in
other
word
,
a
large
component
of
FDI
be
predicate
on
ensure
that
basic
and
apply
research
be
there
and
that
we
have
the
requisite
competent
centre
.
we
have
28
competent
centre
of
excellence
in
various
scientific
field
.
we
have
the
Irish
Centre
for
Manufacturing
Research
and
the
Tyndall
Centre
in
ucc
,
which
be
a
competent
centre
for
micro-electronic
.
in
addition
,
there
be
a
competence
centre
at
NUI
Maynooth
for
it
and
innovation
,
which
be
well
support
by
company
such
as
Intel
Labs
.
there
be
a
strong
collaboration
in
evidence
there
and
,
in
that
sense
,
we
be
continue
to
push
out
the
boundary
.
I
profess
to
have
be
ignorant
of
this
field
when
I
be
in
opposition
.
now
that
I
be
in
government
,
once
one
delve
into
this
,
one
realise
that
it
be
understld
as
a
concept
.
the
deep
collaboration
between
research
and
industry
be
a
good
news
story
because
of
the
number
of
job
it
support
and
the
export
it
generate
.
we
would
not
generate
so
many
export
,
with
a
net
value
of
€
73
billion
,
if
we
do
not
have
this
competence
centre
and
the
world
-
class
researcher
we
be
able
to
attract
to
this
country
.
I
hope
that
answer
the
question
.
I
want
to
address
one
aspect
of
Senator
Kathryn
Reilly
's
question
on
commercialisation
.
each
institute
or
university
competence
centre
have
a
technology
transfer
office
which
seek
to
facilitate
commercialisation
of
research
.
couple
with
that
,
the
State
be
seek
to
prioritise
that
area
of
research
for
which
we
can
create
the
necessary
job
,
thus
focus
on
the
require
research
area
.
that
prioritisation
exercise
be
currently
ongoing
.
Enterprise
Ireland
have
a
presence
in
all
the
BRIC
country
and
the
technological
component
of
that
would
be
as
integral
as
any
another
sector
within
the
economy
.
very
often
,
intellectual
property
,
which
be
valuable
and
might
form
part
of
a
large
innovation
,
be
create
and
the
key
for
we
be
how
to
commercialise
that
research
and
add
value
to
that
who
create
it
.
sometimes
that
give
rise
to
the
creation
of
a
spin
out
company
.
a
total
of
31
such
company
be
create
through
the
high
education
institute
in
2010
but
some
of
the
ip
create
add
value
to
the
Intels
or
HPs
of
the
world
,
which
have
a
presence
in
the
country
and
which
be
collaborate
with
the
researcher
through
they
involvement
in
the
high
education
institute
.
it
be
a
multifaceted
approach
.
we
challenge
be
to
get
more
spin
out
from
Irish
university
and
institute
of
technology
and
to
create
the
right
framework
to
ensure
any
research
or
intellectual
property
create
will
add
value
to
Ireland
Incorporated
.
technology
transfer
office
have
a
key
role
in
this
.
most
importantly
,
the
very
fact
that
this
blue
-
chip
company
interface
with
Irish
university
and
institute
of
technology
through
research
collaboration
to
create
intellectual
property
ensure
we
can
continue
to
retain
that
investment
in
the
country
.
we
can
also
grow
it
because
this
company
return
to
they
parent
company
with
the
good
news
story
of
the
research
component
,
as
the
intellectual
property
add
value
to
the
parent
company
's
stock
or
portfolio
.
we
will
maintain
this
route
and
trajectory
but
we
must
also
meet
the
challenge
of
try
to
get
more
indigenous
spin-out
.
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
and
the
work
of
Jim
O'Hara
on
the
innovation
task
force
be
part
of
this
and
it
continue
apace
.
I
be
not
sure
one
can
one
put
a
stricture
that
intellectual
property
remain
in
the
country
where
it
have
be
create
by
a
researcher
in
a
centre
of
excellence
in
collaboration
with
a
international
company
operate
in
Ireland
.
the
market
be
involved
in
this
in
term
of
how
intellectual
property
be
sell
.
we
try
to
retain
it
here
in
a
way
that
ensure
spin
-
out
company
can
be
create
but
it
do
not
always
happen
this
way
.
the
only
way
a
small
open
economy
dependent
on
foreign
direct
investment
can
ensure
that
investment
be
to
sell
technology
,
innovation
or
intellectual
property
because
it
realise
a
commercial
value
for
the
company
in
Ireland
and
retain
job
in
Ireland
.
I
hope
this
explain
it
.
regard
deputy
Lyons
's
point
,
have
a
presence
in
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
allow
one
a
overview
.
consider
the
teaching
of
mathematics
,
in
which
leave
certificate
pupil
who
be
well
capable
of
do
high
level
math
be
instead
choose
to
do
low
level
.
it
be
a
calculate
decision
on
point
and
the
allocation
of
time
and
resource
.
we
must
move
away
from
that
scenario
and
project
Maths
be
move
in
the
right
direction
.
the
government
be
seek
to
give
political
impetus
to
great
involvement
by
industry
stakeholder
in
shape
policy
so
that
people
might
be
encourage
towards
industry
and
provide
with
the
necessary
preparation
and
skill
.
this
will
take
time
and
I
would
like
this
committee
or
a
sub-
committee
thereof
to
have
a
central
role
in
that
regard
.
if
we
have
expert
within
,
we
should
find
they
a
role
to
try
to
work
out
the
nut
and
bolt
.
from
a
basic
pedagogical
point
of
view
,
the
idea
of
a
steady
pipeline
and
a
more
round
graduate
mean
more
apply
learning
and
problem
solving
as
oppose
to
by
rote
learning
.
the
latter
seem
to
have
evolve
to
such
a
point
that
young
people
who
be
go
into
university
or
institute
of
technology
still
structure
they
learning
in
this
way
.
the
apply
learning
skill
set
need
to
be
buttress
so
that
,
when
company
employ
graduate
,
this
will
be
one
way
to
ensure
apply
learning
have
be
well
build
in
psychologically
.
I
think
it
be
the
Foo

.
I

member
of
this
committee
will
be
aware
that
the
government
have
set
job
creation
and
retention
as
one
of
its
key
priority
in
the
programme
for
government
.
in
this
context
,
the
concept
of
support
enterprise
and
promote
business
innovation
go
to
the
heart
of
what
we
be
do
as
a
government
.
we
will
seek
,
and
we
will
succeed
,
in

effort
to
provide
a
good

a
key
element
of
this
policy
be
the

initiative
.
it
be
a
central
priority
at
the
core
of
my

effort
and
that

have
evolve
to
become
a
key
driver
of
business
success
.
I
would
like
to
outline
the
area
of
focus
within
my
brief
as
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
.

the
sense
that
Enterprise
Ireland
be
very
close
to
the
ground
and
very
knowledgeable
on
what
company
's
need
be
with
regard
to
science
,
technology
and
innovation
because
they
interface
with
they
on
a
daily
basis
.
I
think
I
can
stand
over
this
because
I
have
responsibility
for
science
,
technology
and
innovation
.
extend
the
remit
of
SFI
to
allow
it
into
the
apply
space
would
leverage
more
in
term
of
economic
output
.
however
,
a
challenge
still
exist
.
we
could
do
more
work
with
the
technology
transfer
office
in
each
institution
to
try
to
leverage
more
.
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
will
create
thematic
approach
on
where
research
funding
will
go
,
so
EI
,
SFI
and
the
IDA
will
be
lock
into
a
space
with
the
government
to
allow
as
much
as
possible
to
be
extract
.
it
would
allow
the
potential
to
be
exploit
commercially
to
create
more
job
in
the
field
.
it
be
not
a
case
of
rest
on
we
laurel
.
Successive
government
have
realise
the
potential
of
science
,
technology
and
innovation
and
more
and
more
related
foreign
direct
investment
job
be
embed
in
Ireland
by
virtue
of
the
research
and
development
component
.
we
cannot
overlook
this
either
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
deputy
Tóibín
on
streamlining
.
he
ask
for
figure
on
the
budget
allocation
for
county
enterprise
board
,
ceb
.
exchequer
funding
for
the
CEB
network
at
the
beginning
of
2011
be
€
27.2
million
of
which
€
15
million
be
make
available
for
capital
expenditure
.
in
the
past
two
week
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Perry
,
announce
funding
of
€
3.1
million
for
the
ceb
for
further
job
creation
project
in
the
remain
month
of
2011
.
I
have
not
see
the
metric
on
how
this
have
be
spend
so
far
or
what
be
the
return
on
the
investment
in
term
of
job
creation
.
it
have
yet
to
be
assess
as
far
as
I
be
aware
.
one
must
be
careful
with
regard
to
high
potential
start
-
up
.
I
imagine
the
deputy
have
a
figure
in
mind
,
and
he
mention
100
in
Dublin
alone
.
if
one
seek
to
achieve
this
,
one
can
not
be
afraid
of
failure
.
by
this
I
mean
in
the
US
,
which
have
a
highly
-
evolve
venture
capital
structure
,
there
be
few
hang
-
up
about
failure
.
however
,
if
the
State
will
fund
a
exponentially
large
number
of
high
potential
start
-
up
use
taxpayer
's
money
then
the
State
cannot
be
afraid
of
this
company
fail
.
there
be
a
good
chance
a
certain
proportion
of
high
potential
start
-
up
will
fail
.
the
balance
we
have
strike
be
correct
.
I
will
hear
the
deputy
's
view
on
it
and
I
have
a
open
mind
.
if
we
try
to
hit
this
target
we
will
be
do
fairly
well
.
we
must
be
mindful
that
we
be
fund
company
in
the
sector
use
taxpayer
's
money
and
we
must
be
careful
about
how
we
expend
this
resource
.
there
must
be
check
and
balance
to
ensure
the
risk
be
mitigate
.
much
work
be
be
do
with
regard
to
InterTradeIreland
and
the
North
-
South
link
.
the
trading
and
investing
in
a
smart
economy
strategy
be
launch
in
September
and
it
use
all
of
we
diplomatic
resource
to
maximise
support
for
Irish
business
in
key
market
.
the
focus
be
on
promote
team
Ireland
.
the
deputy
be
aware
of
the
good
work
do
by
the
government
throughout
the
island
with
regard
to
InterTradeIreland
.
I
do
not
have
statistic
with
I
on
this
work
but
I
can
come
back
to
the
deputy
with
the
information
.
I
take
the
point
.
another
point
to
make
on
funding
in
the
science
,
technology
and
innovation
framework
be
that
there
be
much
collaboration
on
the
framework
7
funding
model
between
North
and
South
.
Enterprise
Ireland
's
innovation
voucher
also
work
on
a
North
-
South
basis
.
I
be
happy
to
speak
to
the
deputy
on
the
point
he
have
make
.
I
be
not
entirely
sure
I
accept
Enterprise
Ireland
be
demand
-
lead
.
perhaps
more
could
be
do
with
regard
to
sme
but
the
level
of
engagement
between
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
multinational
sector
which
support
more
than
100000
job
be
a
highly
-
evolve
model
and
constantly
push
out
.
if
member
have
not
already
do
so
I
encourage
they
to
visit
any
of
the
Enterprise
Ireland
partially
-
fund
centre
throughout
the
State
which
be
involved
in
fronty
research
with
industry
.
they
be
support
by
the
State
agency
in
a
very
highly
-
evolve
model
.
it
put
we
in
the
top
20
in
some
of
the
metric
in
specific
area
of
research
.
the
point
can
be
flesh
out
when
Enterprise
Ireland
come
before
the
committee
.
my
experience
as
a
minister
of
state
with
regard
to
work
with
Enterprise
Ireland
on
science
,
technology
and
innovation
be
that
there
be
no
complacency
.
it
constantly
listen
to
industry
on
its
need
.
if
one
visit
institute
such
as
the
Tyndall
Institute
in
Cork
;
the
Centre
for
Research
on
Adaptive
Nanostructures
and
Nanodevices
,
CRANN
;
Athlone
Institute
of
Technology
;
or
Institute
of
Technology
,
Sligo
one
will
see
a
highly
-
evolve
model
of
engagement
on
the
need
of
industry
by
the
State
agency
.
we
should
not
underestimate
this
.
perhaps
a
opportunity
will
be
provide
to
flesh
it
out
in
great
detail
.
I
be
not
aware
of
international
comparator
in
this
area
.
the
measurement
be
the
number
of
job
support
and
the
top
ten
and
top
20
we
hit
in
specific
field
of
research
.
eight
of
the
top
ten
pharmaceutical
company
be
base
in
Ireland
.
I
do
not
have
a
answer
but
I
will
come
back
to
the
deputy
.
to
reply
to
deputy
Conaghan
's
question
,
the
city
of
science
programme
will
be
a
vital
showcase
for
Ireland
.
it
will
happen
in
July
2012
and
we
be
expect
between
5000
and
7000
delegate
.
the
government
will
provide
€
2.9
million
towards
the
cost
of
the
programme
which
will
cost
approximately
€
6
million
.
they
key
focus
will
be
on
showcase
Ireland
's
talent
in
this
field
to
boost
we
standing
internationally
.
the
multiplier
effect
of
up
to
7000
delegate
return
to
they
respective
country
will
be
great
.
we
key
goal
be
to
promote
the
country
in
this
global
setting
.
the
programme
will
have
the
knock
-
on
effect
of
promote
career
in
science
and
great
engagement
by
student
and
parent
because
of
the
publicity
that
will
be
generate
.
we
be
,
therefore
,
take
the
event
seriously
.
in
the
recent
past
people
have
make
a
joke
about
Ireland
try
to
restore
its
international
reputation
,
but
the
government
take
this
agenda
seriously
,
of
which
this
programme
be
part
.
if
we
take
the
opportunity
to
showcase
the
good
and
the
bright
,
we
will
get
a
return
on
we
investment
in
term
of
reputational
enhancement
.
that
be
one
part
of
the
process
.
with
regard
to
school
,
project
Maths
be
a
vital
component
at
second
level
.
the
ship
have
sail
and
the
programme
will
be
roll
out
in
every
school
.
we
believe
strongly
that
because
of
how
it
be
teach
,
it
will
have
a
positive
effect
downstream
on
examination
result
.
the
provision
of
bonus
point
next
year
should
result
in
a
mark
change
in
the
result
obtain
.
the
aim
be
to
ensure
student
think
more
laterally
about
the
everyday
use
of
math
.
we
want
to
deconstruct
a
language
where
parent
say
they
be
never
any
good
at
math
and
this
be
reinforce
in
they
child
.
if
we
can
do
this
,
there
will
be
a
positive
effect
downstream
,
but
we
have
to
be
mindful
of
the
need
to
ensure
that
while
education
be
a
priority
,
there
be
a
balance
between
this
and
the
graduate
we
produce
.
the
intention
should
not
only
be
to
churn
out
engineer
in
order
that
they
can
interface
with
company
but
also
to
get
student
to
think
laterally
in
solve
problem
,
which
be
the
key
component
.
within
the
innovation
and
math
space
we
have
young
social
innovator
.
I
attend
a
event
in
my
home
town
of
Mallow
which
be
attend
by
more
than
2000
parent
and
primary
schoolchild
who
interact
with
provider
in
the
science
and
math
space
.
a
great
deal
of
work
be
be
do
by
the
national
centre
of
excellence
in
the
University
of
Limerick
,
Calmast
and
the
Blackrock
Castle
Observatory
in
Cork
.
the
aim
of
this
initiative
be
to
make
STEM
subject
more
attractive
to
student
at
a
young
age
.
we
be
have
success
in
this
regard
,
but
the
challenge
will
be
to
roll
out
this
project
in
primary
school
.
the
fundamental
question
be
whether
it
be
possible
to
teach
entrepreneurship
.
be
it
something
that
be
innate
or
can
it
be
learn
?
that
be
a
matter
on
which
I
would
defer
to
Senator
Quinn
.
there
be
now
more
flexible
model
in
school
,
particularly
in
transition
year
.
the
YSI
model
be
very
good
and
we
have
see
a
major
proliferation
of
company
be
set
up
at
school
level
.
it
seem
to
be
more
embed
,
but
if
we
need
to
do
more
I
would
like
to
hear
the
Senator
's
view
on
that
.
where
do
we
go
and
be
we
on
the
right
track
?
I
believe
we
be
with
Project
Maths
.
we
need
to
do
more
in
the
junior
cycle
,
but
the
Department
be
do
considerable
work
in
that
and
the
primary
sector
be
the
key
.
we
will
have
continue
professional
development
of
teacher
,
especially
for
teacher
who
be
out
of
field
.
I
may
have
use
the
term
unqualified
teacher
before
-
I
openly
admit
that
be
the
wrong
choice
of
phrasing
.
we
need
to
look
at
out
-
of
-
field
teacher
who
be
teach
math
and
invest
money
-
which
will
happen
-
in
upskil
that
teacher
and
provide
CPD
.
it
all
depend
on
the
engagement
of
the
teacher
and
school
,
and
I
hope
they
will
engage
.
we
also
have
the
excellent
discover
science
and
engineering
programme
run
by
Forfás
,
which
do
much
outreach
with
individual
school
.
Peter
Brabazon
there
do
great
work
in
interact
with
school
.
I
have
only
just
begin
to
engage
with
the
issue
of
fear
of
failure
.
it
be
wear
like
a
badge
of
honour
by
American
engage
with
vc
.
it
be
almost
as
if
one
must
fail
in
order
to
ultimately
succeed
.
we
should
inculcate
that
culture
that
one
be
allow
to
fail
once
and
the
State
agency
will
support
such
a
person
who
want
to
come
back
into
the
system
again
.
the
Department
set
up
a
ICT
steering
group
in
2010
.
that
be
a
stakeholder
forum
to
address
the
issue
deputy
Lyons
and
Senator
Clune
raise
.
we
need
to
start
with
the
dotcom
bubble
that
burst
,
which
lead
to
a
decrease
in
the
point
requirement
for
science
and
ICT
-
related
course
.
as
demand
for
that
course
have
now
increase
,
some
of
that
demand
will
be
fulfil
,
albeit
within
the
next
three
to
four
year
.
the
question
be
what
we
should
do
in
the
intervene
period
to
fill
the
2500
vacancy
deputy
Lyons
mention
.
the
Department
will
shortly
roll
out
a
facility
to
facilitate
bridging
of
the
skill
gap
for
industry
.
that
will
facilitate
engineer
or
other
who
want
to
upskill
and
transfer
into
the
industry
.
this
issue
be
be
tackle
,
but
the
fundamental
issue
be
one
of
get
kid
to
engage
in
programming
language
.
they
know
how
to
play
game
and
be
early
adopter
of
technology
.
I
have
witness
this
with
child
as
young
as
two
year
of
age
.
how
do
we
get
they
into
a
space
in
which
they
begin
to
engage
in
create
game
and
the
knowledge
base
to
see
what
occur
behind
the
screen
?
this
be
where
we
want
to
go
.
work
be
be
do
in
this
regard
,
but
industry
,
include
internet
service
provider
,
have
a
great
role
to
play
.
a
further
engagement
with
the
Irish
Internet
Association
may
be
the
way
to
go
.
a
ICT
action
plan
be
in
place
.
its
purpose
be
to
engage
with
the
question
be
pose
by
deputy
Lyons
and
Senator
Clune
.
we
can
make
it
available
.
DSE
and
other
be
try
to
engage
kid
in
this
platform
,
but
the
work
be
disparate
.
we
have
hear
from
individual
work
with
vec
on
roll
out
specific
programme
in
,
for
example
,
east
County
Galway
,
where
someone
visit
school
to
teach
language
.
how
can
this
be
roll
out
across
the
State
,
give
the
fact
that
not
every
kid
will
be
able
to
engage
?
the
key
point
be
we
be
grapple
with
the
issue
.
one
must
strike
a
balance
between
the
core
educational
subject
and
other
subject
.
I
do
not
want
to
say
"
market
-
focus
"
,
but
if
we
want
to
create
the
good
graduate
in
the
world
,
that
be
the
space
we
must
enter
.
it
must
start
when
kid
be
young
.
the
action
plan
's
bridging
course
will
tackle
personnel
shortage
in
that
sector
in
the
short
term
.
I
have
just
be
inform
by
my
official
.
they
be
excellent
and
we
sometimes
underestimate
they
.
by
all
account
,
the
shortage
within
the
ICT
sector
be
a
global
phenomenon
.
we
be
conscious
of
this
fact
and
be
try
to
bridge
the
gap
.
we
need
to
maintain
the
engagement
with
technology
transfer
office
,
tto
.
the
structure
that
be
in
place
be
vital
.
they
current
round
of
funding
be
up
for
renewal
and
a
conversation
be
under
way
within
the
department
as
to
how
the
funding
process
will
evolve
.
I
have
meet
tto
from
individual
institution
and
one
cannot
but
be
impressed
by
they
work
.
we
need
to
discuss
with
they
the
question
of
extract
more
,
but
they
work
be
inherently
good
and
they
have
a
strong
link
with
industry
.
discussion
be
under
way
on
how
to
extract
further
ips
and
obtain
further
licensing
arrangement
,
whether
we
need
to
be
more
pragmatic
in
we
approach
and
whether
a
conversation
on
get
more
of
a
return
on
this
publicly
fund
research
be
necessary
.
the
tto
have
a
forward
-
look
viewpoint
and
I
will
meet
they
shortly
.
yes
.
one
must
be
conscious
of
the
need
for
tto
.
if
this
component
be
axe
,
there
will
be
a
major
gap
.
it
be
under
review
.

will
be

.
there
will
be
a

year
high

and
a

of

.
this
be
one
way
of
tackle
the
issue
.
I
have
a
good
meeting
with
the
Association
of

last

there
seem
to
be
a

Friday
,
I
visit
Athlone
Institute
of
Technology
,
a
shine
light
regionally
in
how
this
unit
should
be
run
.
the
Midlands
Innovation
and
Research
Centre
,
MIRC
,
in
the
institute
be
do
fabulous
work
.
I
do
not
know
the
statistic
on
age
,
but
the
number
of
mature
student
in
high
level
institution
be
increase
year
on
year
.
this
be
one
way
of
tackle
the
skill
shortage
and
provide
opportunity
for
people
within
the
age
bracket
in
question
.
through
the
VEC
structure
,
college
of
further
education
be
do
a
great
deal
of
work
.
they
age
coterie
be
high
than
average
.
this
be
one
platform
.
the
labour
market
activation
programme
deal
specifically
with
people
aged
over
50
year
.
JobBridge
provide
opportunity
for
people
to
obtain
skill
relevant
to
sector
other
than
that
in
which
they
work
heretofore
.
in
fairness
to
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
there
be
a
great
deal
be
do
to
ensure
we
get
people
within
that
age
bracket
back
into
the
workforce
.
deputy
McFadden
be
correct
that
there
be
people
with
huge
life
and
work
experience
who
do
not
necessarily
have
a
qualification
.
the
government
be
actively
try
to
bring
that
breadth
of
experience
back
into
structure
.
I
take
on
board
the
deputy
's
point
.
springboard
be
a
target
programme
.
on
mentoring
,
I
have
speak
at
length
on
this
issue
with
deputy
Collins
and
have
take
on
board
she
point
about
soft
skill
.
person
will
say
that
it
be
not
always
money
they
be
look
for
when
interact
with
the
State
agency
.
very
often
,
what
they
need
be
mentoring
.
Enterprise
Ireland
operate
a
mentoring
programme
.
if
member
have
view
on
that
programme
-----
it
be
often
perceive
that
that
who
provide
mentoring
be
ex-consultant
or
ex-bank
manager
.
that
be
not
a
criticism
of
bank
manager
.
however
,
we
may
perhaps
need
a
wide
array
of
adviser
in
term
of
mentoring
.
I
be
happy
to
take
part
in
deep
engagement
with
the
committee
in
respect
of
issue
which
individual
member
believe
the
government
need
to
do
more
.
we
will
also
work
to
that
end
.
on
work
permit
,
I
have
be
tell
turnaround
through
the
IDA
be
usually
15
-
day
for
people
with
key
skill
.
I
understand
that
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
be
also
work
on
ensure
a
quick
turnaround
in
respect
of
visa
application
.
if
there
be
specific
example
,
I
would
like
to
hear
they
.
perhaps
we
should
take
a
close
look
at
that
issue
.
I
thank
deputy
Fleming
for
he
comment
and
question
.
I
agree
with
he
in
respect
of
the
priority
he
have
outline
.
I
hope
I
have
address
that
in
the
course
of
the
debate
.
Strategic
alliance
between
the
State
agency
be
highly
evolve
in
the
field
for
which
I
be
responsible
.
there
be
a
intimate
knowledge
between
the
State
agency
and
industry
,
include
the
personality
involve
in
individual
company
.
the
relationship
there
be
close
.
this
issue
be
highly
embed
therein
.
I
respond
early
to
question
on
education
.
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
be
here
.
I
be
happy
to
interact
with
any
cross-party
sub-committee
on
the
science
,
technology
and
innovation
issue
,
even
on
a
informal
basis
.
I
see
no
problem
with
that
proposal
.
I
will
take
the
deputy
's
view
directly
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton

I
apologise
for
miss
the
submission
as
I
be
attend
a
meeting
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
.
the
issue
be
one
of
equity
.
it
also
speak
to
the
fact
of
how
woman
be
treat
vis
-à
-
vo
the
pension
system
as
a
whole
in
this
country
.
the
issue
be
very
simple
in
that
if
the
term
of
a
scheme
be
agree
,
people
buy
into
the
scheme
in
good
faith
and
the
bona
fide
of
the
scheme
be
clearly
establish
,
as
a
matter
of
equity
and
fairness
it
be
necessary
that
the
obligation
of
the
scheme
be
meet
.
this
woman
sign
up
to
the
scheme
in
good
faith
and
the
State
should
honour
its
commitment
in
that
regard
.
there
be
also
the
wide
issue
of
the
treatment
of
woman
who
be
atypical
worker
,
if
I
can
use
that
phrase
,
and
how
we
be
to
deal
with
they
pension
provision
into
the
future
.
I
welcome
the
submission
.
I
have
be
in
touch
with
the
IFA
on
the
issue
and
welcome
the
fact
it
be
represent
here
today
.
we
will
discuss
that
suggestion
at
a
further
meeting
.
I
thank
the
official
from
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
and
from
the
Department
of
social
and
Family
affair
for
briefing
we
so
comprehensively
on
the
issue
.
I
thank
the
member
for
they
attendance
.
the
second
-
last
paragraph
on
page
3
of
the
IFA
submission
state
that
because
the
nitrate
regulation
require
slurry
to
be
spread
by
the
15th
of
the
month
,
the
slurry
be
spread
and
good
grow
grass
be
spoiled
.
such
grass
be
a
essential
and
cost
-
effective
fodder
.
on
the
science
of
prescribe
a
specific
calendar
date
with
regard
to
this
cut
-
off
point
,
can
the
delegate
say
,
in
all
good
scientific
knowledge
,
that
after
the
15th
any
slurry
spread
will
definitively
fall
into
the
water
course
or
table
and
act
as
a
pollutant
?
if
the
answer
be
"
no
"
,
be
there
now
scope
within
the
nitrate
action
plan
—
which
presumably
be
to
be
negotiate
next
year
—
for
a
re-jigging
of
the
system
to
allow
for
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
to
offset
the
prohibitive
nature
of
this
so
-
call
prohibitive
period
?
it
make
absolutely
no
sense
to
spread
slurry
at
certain
time
of
the
year
,
give
we
weather
pattern
,
especially
this
year
,
as
speaker
note
.
such
weather
make
the
spread
of
slurry
impossible
.
be
we
now
suggest
there
must
be
a
State
slurry
storage
facility
if
we
be
to
adhere
to
the
rule
and
regulation
,
or
will
there
be
scope
in
any
renegotiation
of
the
nitrate
action
plan
with
the
commission
to
extend
the
deadline
or
come
up
with
some
other
system
base
on
common
sense
?
I
ask
about
the
prohibitive
period
and
the
negotiation
of
the
nitrogen
action
plan
for
2010
.
base
on
the
answer
we
have
receive
from
Mr.
Duggan
,
I
be
assume
there
will
be
no
change
in
the
State
's
approach
to
the
issue
;
I
assume
the
status
quo
will
remain
in
term
of
we
position
on
the
matter
.
unless
any
one
else
wish
to
contribute
,
we
will
conclude
.
we
have
have
a
useful
discussion
which
last
nearly
two
and
a
half
hour
.
I

remain
here
for
the
duration
of
the
meeting
,
they
participate
in
high
number
thus
demonstrate
this
be
a
important
issue
.
the
joint

they
could
not
all
remain
here
for
the
duration
of
the
meeting
,
they
participate
in
high
number
thus
demonstrate
this
be
a
important
issue
.
the
joint
committee
will
meet
representative
from
a
Bord
Pleanála
at
we
next
meeting
.
what
be
the
view
of
Teagasc
and
the
Department
on
the
first
three
proposal
of
the
ICMSA
on
page
6
of
the
submission
?
on
page
4
of
Teagasc
's
proposal
in
the
independent
review
document
it
be
state
that
it
have
be
demonstrate
that
in
specific
farm
scenario
that
anomaly
be
lead
to
large
structural
phosphorus
deficit
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
broad
view
of
what
that
mean
in
term
of
understand
the
language
.
on
page
24
and
25
of
the
same
document
the
denitrification
process
be
refer
to
and
it
be
state
that
during
the
delay
period
a
large
proportion
of
nitrate
be
expect
to
be
ameliorate
and
denitrify
to
environmentally
benign
n2
gas
.
would
it
be
possible
to
explain
the
precede
paragraph
in
layman
's
term
?
the
reason
I
ask
that
question
be
because
they
have
a
bear
in
term
of
calculation
.
on
page
3
of
the
Teagasc
submission
the
introduction
of
new
scientific
research
and
flexibility
in
the
close
period
be
refer
to
.
I
would
like
a
explanation
of
that
paragraph
and
the
transitional
arrangement
for
pig
and
poultry
manure
.
Specific
reference
be
make
to
propose
amendment
in
the
submission
on
nitrogen
availability
in
organic
manure
.
could
one
of
the
Teagasc
representative
expand
slightly
on
this
?
it
seem
what
be
be
suggest
be
that
amendment
on
the
simplification
of
calculation
for
maximum
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
fertiliser
allowance
be
adopt
to
encourage
the
use
of
pig
and
poultry
manure
by
livestock
farmer
.
what
be
the
basis
of
that
advice
?
I
would
like
to
know
that
in
layman
's
term
because
perhaps
I
do
not
fully
understand
the
scientific
language
of
it
.
the
draft
gap
regulation
include
a
mechanism
through
which
they
can
be
regulate
to
reflect
the
outcome
from
new
research
on
peer
requirement
of
crop
and
animal
as
soon
as
this
be
publish
before
the
next
review
.
can
the
delegate
expand
on
this
also
?
page
97
of
the
Teagasc
document
refer
to
streamline
the
derogation
under
the
gap
regulation
.
this
have
a
major
bear
on
outcome
in
the
political
process
.
Teagasc
believe
that
have
two
separate
date
associate
with
the
process
can
cause
unnecessary
confusion
for
derogation
applicant
and
participant
.
can
the
process
be
streamline
mid-stream
?
what
would
the
benefit
of
that
be
in
real
term
?
we
be
all
in
complete
agreement
that
the
food
harvest
2020
proposal
will
have
to
be
predicate
on
the
notion
that
we
can
continue
to
maximise
efficiency
and
that
there
be
a
political
process
set
up
so
that
Ireland
's
comparative
advantage
on
food
production
will
not
be
compromise
.
there
be
a
programme
set
out
for
each
of
the
sector
such
as
dairy
,
poultry
,
pig
and
so
on
,
and
the
Labour
Party
would
welcome
that
new
programme
.
if
the
science
be
suggest
that
we
can
deal
with
phosphorus
and
nitrogen
and
manage
it
in
such
a
way
,
and
if
Teagasc
be
come
up
with
research
that
ameliorate
it
so
that
we
do
not
compromise
on
we
production
and
we
comparative
economic
advantage
,
then
every
political
party
will
have
to
support
a
process
that
ensure
we
can
achieve
the
good
for
Irish
agriculture
.
I
happen
to
think
that
the
science
be
there
to
ensure
that
,
but
I
also
think
that
a
message
should
be
send
to
the
Minister
for
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
that
if
there
be
pollutant
within
the
agricultural
sector
and
if
he
be
hell
bend
on
go
down
the
line
of
constrict
agricultural
practice
,
then
he
must
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
there
be
other
major
pollutant
that
be
also
under
he
remit
,
such
as
local
authority
.
if
the
minister
spend
more
time
go
after
local
authority
and
invest
properly
in
infrastructure
,
that
would
significantly
improve
water
quality
in
this
country
also
.
we
will
assume
the
minister
have
not
take
the
decision
.
I
thank
the
chairman
and
member
of
the
committee
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
address
the
committee
on
the
current
situation
in
Northern
Ireland
and
the
agreement
reach
follow
ten
week
of
intensive
talk
.
as
member
of
the
committee
will
know
,
this
talk
be
bring
to
a
successful
conclusion
on
17
November
2015
with
negotiation
result
in
''
a
Fresh

financial
support
from
the
British
and
Irish
government
and
implementation
of
other
aspect
of
the
Stormont

regrettably
,
it
be
not
possible
within
the
timescale
of
this
talk
to
address
all
aspect
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
and
this
be
something
I
will
return
to
in
more
detail
late
.
the
Fresh

agreement
be
not
a
final
destination
but
represent
a
significant
step
forward
towards
normalise
politics
and
society
.
consider
where
we

,
in

of
the

to
the
very

of

,
the

be
the

I
be
glad
to
report
that
five
North
-
South

sectoral
meeting
have
take
place
since
the

of
the

be
important
that
momentum
on

be
pick
up
again
both
within
the
NSMC
and
outside
of
the
formal
structure
,
with
particular
focus
on
the
economy
,
employment
and
business
development
.
it
be
not
possible
,
unfortunately
,
to
address
all
aspect
of
the
implementation
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
in
the
Fresh
start
agreement
.
it
be
regrettable
that
a
Fresh
start
do
not
address
the
implementation
of
the
provision
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
.
I
share
the
disappointment
feel
by
the
victim
of
the
trouble
,
the
survivor
and
they
family
.
on
several
occasion
I
act
as
co-chair
to
the
round
-
table
discussion
on
legacy
issue
.
we
be
very
close
to
agreement
on
a
range
of
issue
,
include
the
establishment
and
operation
of
the
historical
investigation
unit
and
the
independent
commission
for
information
retrieval
,
the
setting
up
of
the
implementation
and
reconciliation
group
on
a
statutory
footing
and
the
detail
and
operation
of
the
oral
history
archive
.
a
crucial
issue
upon
which
agreement
could
not
be
find
be
in
strike
the
right
balance
between
the
disclosure
need
of
family
and
the
national
security
requirement
seek
by
the
British
government
.
I
stress
again
,
and
as
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
have
say
previously
,
it
be
not
the
Irish
government
which
press
for
a
agreement
that
leave
aside
the
legacy
of
the
past
.
however
,
when
it
become
clear
that
the
choice
be
between
have
a
agreement
which
uncouple
the
past
or
have
no
agreement
at
all
,
the
government
agree
most
reluctantly
to
have
a
less
than
comprehensive
deal
which
would
at
least
ensure
devolve
institution
would
be
protect
and
place
on
a
stable
and
sustainable
footing
.
it
be
important
now
to
find
a
way
forward
that
bank
the
good
progress
achieve
during
the
talk
and
secure
a
solution
to
outstanding
matter
.
to
this
end
,
contact
continue
with
the
British
government
,
the
five
main
political
party
in
Northern
Ireland
and
,
most
important
,
with
various
victim
's
group
.
the

,
deputy
Flanagan

Northern
Ireland

Victim
and
Survivor

November
to
discuss
the
concern
of
victim
and
possible
way
to
take
the
issue
forward
in
a
way
that
satisfy
this
concern
.
the

Ford

and
legacy
be
a
key
agenda
item
.
legacy
will
also
be
key
in
the
upcoming
meeting
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
with
the
Secretary
of
State
for
Northern
Ireland
before
Christmas
.
the
provision
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
for
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
offer
the
good
possible
way
of
bring
whatever
healing
be
possible
to
that
affect
by
the
trouble
.
to
achieve
this
,
it
be
vital
this
new
institution
have
the
trust
and
confidence
of
survivor
and
they
family
.
they
need
will
remain
central
to
the
government
's
work
in
this
area
.
I
reiterate
the
government
's
commitment
to
work
with
the
Northern
Ireland
executive
and
the
British
government
to
ensure
a
Fresh
start
be
implement
in
full
.
while
work
will
continue
on
the
vital
issue
of
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
,
this
agreement
be
a
further
step
forward
in
Northern
Ireland
's
journey
towards
long
-
term
peace
and
stability
.
through
the
implementation
of
the
agreement
,
there
be
a
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
power
-
share
devolution
can
provide
good
government
and
can
offer
hope
for
future
generation
.
I
thank
committee
member
for
they
time
.
I
will
come
back
to
the
chairman
on
the
petition
of
concern
,
but
as
I
have
say
,
it
be
not
the
Irish
government
which
press
for
a
agreement
that
completely
leave
aside
the
legacy
of
the
past
.
the
government
be
face
with
a
choice
between
have
a
agreement
which
uncouple
the
past
or
have
no
agreement
at
all
.
with
regard
to
deal
with
the
legacy
,
there
be
a
very
firm
commitment
by
the
government
to
ensure
we
continue
the
engagement
on
legacy
issue
.
it
will
be
vital
to
continue
the
engagement
with
victim

level
political
engagement
will
continue
between
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
and
the
Secretary
of
State
for
Northern
Ireland
.
that
engagement
will
continue
apace
next
week
.
one
could
say
there
be
a
period
of
reflection
happen
now
.
however
,
it
be
important
that
we
acknowledge
that
a
lot
of
energy
be
put
into
deal
with
legacy
issue
during
the
ten
week
process
.
it
would
not
serve
the
good
interest
of
both
community
,
north
,
south
,
east
and
west
,
not
to
continue
the
work
.
it
be
vital
that
we
continue
it
but
we
must
find
a
mechanism
and
a
means
that
will
allow
we
to
do
so
.
the
executive
agree
a
protocol
on
the
use
of
the
petition
of
concern
that
seek
to
limit
its
use
.
it
be
voluntary
in
nature
so
we
will
have
to
see
how
it
will
operate
within
the
Assembly
.
there
be
perhaps
a
school
of
thought
that
the
petition
of
concern
power
have
be
use
at
sensitive
time
.
the
protocol
be
now
in
place
,
however
,
and
the
Irish
government
hope
the
procedure
will
be
use
with
a
positive
mindset
,
if
that
make
sense
.
I
will
endeavour
to
be
as
comprehensive
as
possible
.
if
I
miss
out
on
something
,
I
hope
member
will
come
back
in
.
deputy
Kitt
make
a
point
on
legacy
.
we
take
the
view
that
we
be
close
to
agreement
on
the
operation
of
the
historical
investigation
unit
,
include
on
the
provision
of
guarantee
its
independence
and
the
point
that
it
would
be
compliant
with
the
Patten
principle
on
policing
and
justice
.
let
we
go
back
to
what
I
say
originally
and
factor
in
deputy
Crowe
's
point
on
where
the
agreement
fall
.
we
express
we
preference
during
the
talk
for
a
process
that
would
cover
the
range
of
legacy
issue
on
which
agreement
be
possible
.
the
view
be
that
there
should
be
a
approach
to
inculcate
a
process
or
speak
to
the
issue
of
legacy
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
exclude
it
from
a
agreement
.
the
idea
be
to
ensure
that
we
would
have
a
pathway
for
continuation
.
in
the
absence
of
agreement
on
the
issue
we
be
now
in
a
situation
where
we
stand
ready
to
engage
on
legacy
issue
again
.
the
two
government
be
seek
a
way
forward
.
it
be
not
possible
to
put
a
exact
timeline
on
it
.
we
be
willing
to
engage
.
however
,
in
the
case
of
legacy
issue
people
have
to
be
willing
to
engage
on
the
basis
that
there
be
the
prospect
of
success
.
I
take
the
point
make
about
what
one
might
term
the
anachronistic
iterative
process
that
have
go
on
since
1998
and
whether
it
be
possible
to
provide
a
way
for
innovation
to
allow
we
to
overcome
this
issue
outside
of
a
hothouse
arrangement
or
a
intensive
process
that
go
on
for
ten
week
,
but
one
in
which
there
be
no
guarantee
of
success
on
certain
aspect
that
need
to
be
deal
with
for
the
benefit
of
this
island
and
we
neighbour
to
the
east
.
there
be
scope
now
for
some
new
thinking
at
political
level
in
term
of
how
we
engage
on
a
ongoing
basis
rather
than
within
the
confine
process
.
we
do
not
always
get
the
outcome
we
desire
.
deputy
O'Reilly
make
a
particular
point
.
section
a
of
the
agreement
contain
a
specific
reference
to
the
joint
agency
task
force
.
the
deputy
ask
how
that
be
comprise
.
it
will
be
lead
by
senior
officer
from
Police
Service
of
Northern
Ireland
,
the
Garda
Síochána
,
the
Revenue
commissioner
and
HM
Revenue
and
custom
.
there
be
a
specific
reference
to
the
effect
that
the
task
force
will
report
on
its
work
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
arrangement
in
place
for
the
law
enforcement
agency
.
in
turn
,
the
task
force
will
have
a
strategic
oversight
group
and
a
operation
co-ordination
unit
.
that
much
be
well
lay
out
.
deputy
O'Reilly
also
ask
about
economic
activity
and
support
within
the
Border
region
.
he
make
reference
to
the
peace
and
INTERREG
programme
.
I
contend
that
the
government
have
do
a
great
deal
of
work
with
we
neighbour
to
ensure
funding
will
be
provide
where
there
be
framework
for
it
.
a
great
deal
of
work
be
do
to
get
we
to
the
point
where
we
actually
agree
on
peace
,
for
example
.
that
will
translate
back
into
the
Border
region
in
respect
of
economic
activity
.
I
take
the
point
make
on
the
north
-
west
gateway
initiative
.
the
A5
proposal
be
the
key
.
deputy
Kitt
ask
about
the
€
110
million
allocation
.
that
be
the
entirety
of
the
package
from
a
Irish
government
perspective
,
so
it
be
inclusive
of
the
north
-
west
gateway
initiative
.
it
also
include
the
other
commitment
on
the
A5
.
no
one
would
disagree
with
the
fact
that
the
north
west
be
a
region
require
more
in
respect
of
political
commitment
.
there
be
good
initiative
at
play
there
at
present
,
particularly
with
the
two
council
on
either
side
of
the
Border
.
it
be
for
we
at
governmental
level
to
try
to
support
that
in
every
way
we
can
.
increase
economic
activity
be
one
of
the
key
area
.
deputy
's
Crowe
speak
about
legacy
,
national
security
and
the
approach
take
.
I
think
I
have
answer
the
question
about
the
approach
.
if
I
be
to
speak
personally
,
I
would
say
that
perhaps
the
approach
need
to
be
look
at
again
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
ageist
,
but
I
be
,
perhaps
,
part
of
a
particular
generation
of
politician
.
we
can
name
any
number
of
agreement
and
negotiation
,
such
as
the
1998
process
or
the
Weston
Park
negotiation
;
it
be
a
iterative
process
.
this
generation
be
as
much
oblige
as
the
previous
one
to
continue
the
work
on
legacy
issue
,
however
.
we
do
not
want
to
let
another
generation
pass
without
ensure
that
justice
can
be
find
for
the
victim
and
they
family
.
that
be
a
fundamental
principle
which
underpin
any
Irish
government
policy
on
the
North
,
no
matter
who
be
in
the
driving
seat
.
while
we
stand
ready
to
re-engage
on
legacy
issue
,
the
timing
of
that
engagement
remain
to
be
determine
.
we
look
forward
to
co-operate
.
in
my
open
remark
I
say
that
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
will
be
meet
with
the
Secretary
of
State
,
Ms
Villier
,
next
week
.
part
of
that
conversation
will
be
about
continue
to
maintain
momentum
on
the
need
to
deal
with
the
issue
which
deputy
Crowe
have
articulate
in
respect
of
national
security
and
disclosure
.
I
do
not
think
today
be
the
day
to
open
up
part
of
the
negotiation
again
.
we
feel
that
we
have
make
some
progress
in
create
the
institution
that
be
necessary
to
deal
with
legacy
,
such
as
the
implementation
and
reconciliation
group
,
IRG
and
the
historical
investigation
unit
,
HIU
.
however
,
during
the
process
of
negotiation
there
be
agreement
all
around
that
we
need
to
get
to
a
point
at
which
there
be
at
least
agreement
on
the
need
to
restore
confidence
in
the
institution
.
there
be
consensus
that
we
would
revisit
the
other
aspect
and
continue
to
devote
energy
to
they
.
person
have
express
they
good
wish
and
congratulation
but
I
have
to
say
that
congratulation
be
due
to
Mr.
Garvin
and
Ms
McGrath
beside
I
,
and
to
a
great
team
of
official
from
both
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
and
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
.
incidentally
,
that
Department
will
take
the
lead
in
the
interaction
on
the
task
force
issue
.
it
be
a
team
approach
and
the
work
will
continue
between
set
of
negotiation
.
I
reassure
the
committee
that
it
be
a
constant
process
.
there
be
a
specific
question
about
flood
relief
and
energy
.
that
issue
be
deal
with
in
the
sectoral
element
and
in
the
ongoing
work
at
ministerial
level
.
as
I
say
at
the
outset
,
we
have
see
a
new
energy
about
ensure
that
the
agenda
on
ongoing
North
-
South
issue
,
such
as
flooding
and
flood
relief
,
be
deal
with
through
sectoral
engagement
.
have
the
Senator
ever
drive
through
the
Dunkettle
roundabout
?
it
be
in
my
parish
.
I
would
like
,
first
,
to
thank
Dr.
Alasdair
McDonnell
for
he
good
wish
in
that
sense
.
we
should
note
the
contribution
he
make
as
a
negotiator
on
behalf
of
he
party
;
he
be
at
the
table
as
well
.
a
great
deal
of
work
be
do
by
all
party
in
respect
of
the
contribution
to
this
agreement
.
I
be
just
one
person
.
along
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
,
I
represent
the
Irish
government
at
the
talk
.
however
,
talk
be
only
as
good
as
the
people
who
contribute
to
they
.
significant
contribution
be
make
by
that
on
all
side
.
I
take
this
opportunity
,
in
a
personal
capacity
,
to
thank
Dr.
Alasdair
McDonnell
for
he
role
and
also
for
the
contribution
he
make
,
as
the
former
leader
of
he
party
,
when
the
talk
be
ongoing
.
the
word
"
blanket
"
be
use
and
Mr.
Brady
refer
to
the
cover
of
the
blanket
during
the
past
40
year
.
with
respect
to
the
generational
element
,
there
be
as
much
of
a
responsibility
on
politician
of
my
generation
as
there
be
on
that
who
go
before
we
to
ensure
that
the
legacy
issue
be
not
forget
.
we
need
to
continue
to
press
the
British
government
on
the
Dublin
and
Monaghan
bombing
,
the
Pat
Finucane
case
and
the
relative
group
.
in
the
context
of
the
issue
of
disclosure
and
national
security
,
we
need
to
ensure
that
some
mechanism
be
find
to
deal
with
the
outstanding
historical
issue
.
if
society
be
to
heal
itself
and
if
we
be
talk
about
the
restoration
of
normative
politics
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
there
will
not
be
a
move
on
that
restoration
until
such
time
as
that
issue
be
deal
with
.
that
be
a
view
that
inform
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Justice
and
Equality
in
they
everyday
work
.
in
the
context
of
the
team
of
people
from
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
who
work
with
the
victim
and
family
and
at
political
level
in
Northern
Ireland
-
quietly
and
underneath
the
radar
-
in
term
of
try
to
progress
this
agenda
on
a
constant
basis
,
it
be
fair
to
say
that
successive
Irish
government
have
seek
to
lean
heavily
on
the
British
government
with
regard
to
very
specific
case
and
in
respect
of
the
principle
that
if
society
be
to
heal
itself
,
it
can
not
do
so
unless
the
legacy
issue
be
deal
with
.
I
would
contend
that
much
progress
be
make
last
year
on
devise
a
process
for
deal
with
the
legacy
issue
and
in
regard
to
the
potential
for
set
up
institutional
change
that
would
deal
with
that
.
we
will
continue
to
work
on
that
matter
.
when
the
minister
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
,
meet
the
Secretary
of
State
,
Theresa
Villier
,
next
week
,
the
legacy
issue
will
continue
to
be
discuss
and
they
will
continue
to
be
live
issue
.
I
take
the
point
that
be
make
by
deputy
Smith
on
the
issue
of
the
timeline
and
the
electoral
cycle
.
the
work
continue
regardless
of
the
electoral
cycle
.
whether
it
be
possible
to
begin
a
process
again
early
in
the
new
year
remain
to
be
see
but
,
as
I
say
at
the
outset
,
the
Irish
government
stand
ready
to
engage
.
if
there
be
a
process
that
be
to
be
start
again
in
regard
to
deal
with
this
issue
,
we
stand
ready
.
there
be
no
doubt
but
that
we
stand
ready
to
deal
with
the
legacy
issue
.
we
will
continue
the
engagement
with
the
Secretary
of
State
.
we
have
a
soon
to
be
appoint
first
minister
,
if
that
person
have
not
be
ratify
already
and
there
be
a
deputy
first
minister
.
with
respect
to
the
negotiation
,
we
feel
strongly
that
we
have
make
progress
on
the
legacy
issue
.
if
the
party
within
the
executive
feel
that
there
be
a
urgency
about
deal
with
this
matter
in
the
next
number
of
week
,
the
Irish
government
stand
ready
to
engage
with
the
party
on
it
.
with
respect
to
Senator
Jim
D'Arcy
's
point
on
justice
issue
,
a
meeting
between
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Fitzgerald
,
and
Mr.
David
Forde
take
place
on
11
December
and
another
meeting
will
take
place
next
week
.
if
one
note
the
strategic
oversight
group
,
a
distinction
can
be
make
between
set
up
a
agency
and
set
up
a
task
force
.
in
the
context
of
establish
a
task
force
and
do
so
correctly
,
I
would
refer
to
a
strategic
oversight
group
which
be
inherent
within
the
task
force
and
a
operation
co-ordination
group
.
I
will
quote
directly
from
the
document
,
which
state
,
"
representative
from
the
relevant
law
enforcement
agency
at
senior
management
level
)
that
will
identify
strategic
priority
for
combate
cross-
jurisdictional
organised
crime
"
.
there
be
the
day
-
to
-
day
work
that
continue
with
respect
to
the
cross
-border
crime
effort
.
this
will
allow
for
a
flexible
and
reflexive
response
at
the
same
time
and
it
would
be
possible
to
do
that
in
a
co-ordinate
way
.
there
will
be
six
-
monthly
ministerial
meeting
to
ensure
that
this
work
be
give
the
energy
that
it
absolutely
deserve
.
I
note
the
point
in
the
agreement
about
Narrow
Water
bridge
,
the
point
about
the
symbolism
of
the
road
go
both
way
,
as
be
say
,
in
regard
to
the
potential
for
tourism
.
I
note
also
the
point
that
be
make
in
it
on
the
issue
of
funding
for
tourism
in
context
of
the
peace
or
INTERREG
programme
.
I
further
note
the
point
that
be
make
about
the
wording
in
regard
to
strengthen
it
and
put
a
budget
line
behind
it
,
and
that
be
something
we
will
take
away
from
this
.
with
regard
to
the
point
on
the
petition
of
concern
and
have
a
opposition
,
we
have
a
appreciation
of
the
various
strand
that
exist
under
the
good
Friday
agreement
.
there
be
a
appreciation
in
this
committee
of
the
area
of
competence
.
in
the
context
of
Mr.
McCallister
's
Bill
,
I
would
say
that
if
one
view
it
from
one
perspective
,
it
be
a
very
positive
contribution
to
the
restoration
of
normative
politics
in
Northern
Ireland
.
however
,
as
a
member
of
the
Dáil
,
and
observe
it
from
that
vantage
point
,
I
would
say
,
without
seek
to
kick
to
touch
,
that
this
would
still
be
a
matter
for
the
Northern
Ireland
executive
.
we
would
not
go
into
the
proposal
in
the
Bill
from
a
government
point
of
view
but
it
be
a
positive
step
forward
in
term
of
the
contribution
it
will
make
towards
the
restoration
of
normative
politics
.
I
be
not
say
that
politics
there
be
abnormal
in
any
sense
,
I
be
just
say
that
we
operate
in
a
particular
way
within
this
House
.
as
parliamentarian
,
the
concept
of
opposition
and
government
be
completely
inherent
to
how
we
do
business
.
I
would
imagine
that
any
move
towards
that
would
be
welcome
but
there
be
still
a
executive
and
we
acknowledge
that
as
well
.
I
hope
I
have
answer
all
of
the
question

I
,
too
,
welcome
the
minister
and
he
official
.
I
be
try
to
get
my
head
around
the
status
of
peace
iv
,
the
special
European
Union
Programmes
Body
,
SEUPB
,
and
INTERREG
.
there
be
concern
about
the
future
status
of
project
in
the
pipeline
.
we
will
have
the
North
's
Minister
of
Finance
here
late
.
will
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
give
we
he
political
perspective
on
where
peace
IV
and
INTERREG
stand
?
approximately
€550
million
from
Europe
be
allocate
in
this
regard
.
many
people
in
the
Border
area
have
a
expectation
around
that
matter
and
there
be
some
question
mark
over
it
.
what
be
the
minister
's
perspective
on
it
,
particularly
in
light
of
the
deadline
on
this
project
come
in
November
vis-à
-
vo
the
Treasury
?
do
we
know
the
Treasury
's
position
?
have
that
position
harden
with
regard
to
commitment
there
?
this
project
have
serious
implication
for
people
.
we
will
now
move
into
private
session
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
I
join
the
welcome
to
the
minister
.
my
first
question
relate
specifically
to
the
minister
's
intervention
where
he
state
that
he
have
agree
a
safeguard
clause
to
Brexit
-
proof
letter
of
offer
to
programme
beneficiary
.
could
he
flesh
out
that
statement
and
tell
we
exactly
what
it
mean
in
relation
to
secure
funding
line
for
the
very
programme
he
talk
about
?
the
second
issue
I
wish
to
raise
relate
to
Horizon
2020
.
I
be
encourage
by
the
fact
that
the
minister
make
specific
reference
to
it
.
he
might
indicate
what
the
permutation
might
be
for
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
,
fund
programme
whereby
the
legislative
base
within
the
twenty
-
six
County
be
such
that
the
remit
of
SFI
allow
it
to
fund
researcher
in
the
North
and
the
South
.
I
be
concerned
that
when
the
United
Kingdom
exit
the
European
Union
,
it
will
put
this
island
at
a
disadvantage
when
it
come
to
access
the
Horizon
2020
funding
pot
because
,
to
all
intent
and
purpose
,
there
be
two
jurisdiction
which
can
collaborate
to
access
funding
from
the
main
source
.
have
the
government
give
any
thought
to
what
the
permutation
will
be
in
seek
science
funding
and
for
the
island
of
Ireland
in
reach
the
state
target
in
access
the
Horizon
2020
funding
pot
?
have
the
government
,
not
specifically
the
minister
,
engage
with
Science
Foundation
Ireland
on
have
a
co-ordinate
view
on
the
research
infrastructure
which
be
vital
in
support
thousand
of
job
,
North
and
South
?
what
be
the
minister
's
general
view
on
that
issue
?
we
be
all
follow
the
passage
of
the
legislation
before
the
House
of
Commons
.
I
understand
the
opposition
tab
a
amendment
,
no.
86
,
to
require
article
50
not
break
to
anything
agree
to
in
the
good
Friday
agreement
,
to
put
it
loosely
.
I
understand
the
amendment
be
defeat
by
a
majority
of
39
.
therefore
,
de
facto
,
the
Tories
defeat
the
amendment
.
I
be
concerned
about
this
.
be
the
government
watch
the
legislation
from
that
vantage
point
?
do
it
have
a
strong
view
that
sufficient
attention
be
be
give
by
the
UK
government
to
the
good
Friday
agreement
?
if
the
UK
government
be
defeat
simple
amendment
of
this
nature
,
it
may
speak
to
a
certain
attitude
that
would
concern
I
.
that
be
just
in
from
the
UK
Exchequer
.
be
that
correct
?
I
propose
that
we
go
into
private
session
to
conclude
a
few
housekeeping
matter
.
be
that
agree
?

I
welcome
the
visit
of
Mr.
Verhofstadt
.
his
engagement
with
the
people
of
Northern
Ireland
,
particularly
that
in
the
Border
region
,
and
he
comment
on
enable
Northern
Ireland
to
retain
access
to
the
single
market
and
custom
union
be
warmly
welcome
.
I
concur
with
my
fellow
speaker
who
have
say
that
by
any
objective
analysis
,
as
co-ordinator
Mr.
Verhofstadt
have
display
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
dynamic
at
play
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
he
be
right
when
he
say
that
responsibility
for
find
a
solution
to
the
Irish
Border
question
lie
with
the
UK
and
no
realistic
proposal
have
yet
emerge
from
that
quarter
.
my
first
question
be
very
simple
.
will
Mr.
Verhofstadt
and
he
colleague
,
Mr.
Brok
and
Mr.
Gualtieri
,
consider
include
within
the
wording
of
any
final
European
Parliament
resolution
a
clause
that
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
be
maintain
and
the
principle
of
parity
of
esteem
and
human
rights
protection
be
upheld
,
especially
give
that
56
%
of
the
population
in
Northern
Ireland
vote
to
remain
within
the
EU
?
if
no
such
protection
be
forthcoming
from
the
UK
,
will
the
European
Parliament
veto
any
outcome
that
do
not
satisfy
that
fundamental
rights
?
my
second
question
relate
to
a
very
good
article
by
Mr.
Verhofstadt
that
be
publish
in
the
Observer
on
9
July
last
,
in
which
he
write
very
rationally
about
the
UK
position
on
citizen
's
rights
.
he
refer
particularly
to
third
country
national
,
the
new
status
that
will
pertain
in
the
UK
,
the
need
for
separate
application
for
settle
status
and
the
five
-
year
residence
requirement
.
this
be
another
simple
question
.
how
seriously
be
the
European
Parliament
take
the
UK
's
negotiating
position
,
which
be
grossly
insulting
to
any
Irish
person
live
in
the
UK
who
have
settle
there
for
year
and
have
a
intergenerational
relationship
and
which
will
set
back
the
cause
of
Anglo
-
Irish
relation
by
year
?
I
would
like
to
know
Mr.
Verhofstadt
's
opinion
on
that
.
thank
you
very
much
,
a
Chathaoirligh
.
I
apologise
for
be
late
.
first
,
to
what
consultation
be
Mr.
Hynes
refer
?
second
,
from
a
layman
's
point
of
view
how
would
Mr.
Stack
envisage
a
amnesty
would
work
relative
to
current
legislation
?
for
example
,
if
the
person
come
through
the
process
and
if
the
family
recommend
the
amnesty
would
that
give
rise
to
a
legislative
framework
which
would
have
to
supersede
or
complement
current
legislation
vis
-à
-
vis
criminal
law
as
it
stand
?
on
Glencree
,
the
conclusion
be
that
we
must
ensure
that
the
legacy
of
the
past
be
not
another
stage
to
play
out
tired
,
repetitive
and
old
,
wear
out
argument
.
be
there
a
critique
to
be
have
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
as
it
relate
to
,
for
instance
,
the
independent
Commission
for
Information
Retrieval
,
the
oral
history
archive
and
the
legacy
of
the
past
issue
?
be
there
enough
within
that
three
proposal
as
agree
in
Stormont
to
chart
a
way
forward
which
everybody
could
potentially
buy
-
into
with
confidence
from
a
Glencree
perspective
?
I
thank
all
of
today
's
witness
.
Mr.
Hynes
note
we
responsibility
as
a
committee
.
we
be
try
to
formulate
a
report
on
the
issue
of
victim
and
legacy
issue
and
it
be
hope
that
some
of
the
issue
raise
today
will
form
part
of
the
report
and
its
recommendation
.
I
hope
the
witness
find
the
opportunity
to
give
evidence
here
today
useful
and
I
apologise
again
for
the
late
starting
hour
of
the
meeting
.
I
realise
the
structure
itself
be
probably
not
great
for
interaction
and
so
on
but
it
be
what
we
be
face
with
.
I
think
everyone
be
impressed
with
the
evidence
today
.
it
have
give
we
a
lot
to
think
about
for
the
report
.
if
there
be
anything
the
witness
feel
they
,
as
a
group
,
may
have
overlook
here
today
,
please
forward
it
to
we
and
we
will
include
it
in
the
report
.
I
wish
the
witness
a
safe
journey
home
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
allow
I
to
substitute
for
deputy
Duncan
Smith
.
I
come
from
the
town
of
Mallow
,
which
be
one
of
that
town
that
the
minister
have
describe
in
term
of
develop
they
potential
and
radiate
they
service
outward
.
I
be
a
regular
rail
user
.
currently
,
90
%
of
my
travel
be
by
rail
between
Mallow
and
Dublin
.
I
be
a
onward
user
of
the
Leap
card
,
which
be
like
a
piece
of
gold
to
I
.
if
I
be
a
Mallow
resident
,
though
,
I
can
not
use
it
to
travel
to
Cork
.
I
can
travel
from
Dublin
Pearse
Station
to
Greystone
use
a
Leap
card
,
but
not
from
Mallow
to
Cork
.
therein
lie
the
injustice
and
inequality
.
I
have
be
campaign
for
nearly
three
year
to
have
the
Leap
card
service
extend
between
Mallow
and
Cork
.
I
have
be
go
in
and
out
of
the
National
Transport
Authority
,
NTA
,
and
go
around
the
house
.
if
the
minister
be
serious
about
shift
mode
of
transport
and
put
people
on
train
and
bus
,
will
he
please
take
on
this
simple
issue
?
it
be
useless
for
we
to
talk
about
modal
shift
unless
we
go
after
the
low
-
hanging
fruit
.
it
would
be
significant
if
the
Leap
card
could
be
use
by
student
,
old
people
or
people
of
any
age
to
go
in
and
out
of
Cork
.
we
would
see
a
dramatic
reduction
in
the
number
of
car
on
the
road
to
Cork
because
public
transport
service
could
be
extend
.
my
next
issue
concern
town
themselves
.
I
hope
that
the
minister
have
relation
in
or
some
connection
to
Mallow
,
Buttevant
and
Charleville
.
I
be
sure
he
will
recount
a
personal
tale
for
we
.
if
he
have
a
personal
connection
to
any
of
that
town
,
I
implore
he
to
ensure
that
the
ongoing
consultation
process
in
respect
of
a
bypass
for
Mallow
be
follow
up
with
a
budget
line
.
it
be
vital
that
the
town
be
bypass
,
but
it
be
also
important
that
if
we
be
go
to
-
I
believe
I
have
interpret
the
minister
correctly
in
this
-
bypass
town
like
Mallow
,
Buttevant
and
Charleville
,
we
do
not
take
we
eye
off
the
ball
as
regard
the
propose
M20
Cork
-
Limerick
motorway
.
I
continue
to
make
the
case
for
the
motorway
on
the
basis
of
regional
investment
into
the
very
town
the
minister
be
talk
about
on
the
one
hand
and
,
on
the
other
,
ensure
that
we
make
road
safe
.
there
have
be
too
many
fatality
on
the
route
between
Cork
and
Limerick
.
on
average
,
there
be
more
than
17000
movement
between
Cork
and
Charleville
per
day
.
too
many
people
have
die
.
I
ask
that
the
proposal
not
be
mutually
exclusive
goal
.
the
bypass
be
need
,
but
there
be
also
a
need
to
deal
with
town
like
Mallow
,
Buttevant
and
Charleville
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
too
parochial
,
but
we
must
speak
to
thousand
upon
thousand
of
people
in
the
Munster
region
who
be
depend
on
the
bypass
to
be
complete
in
a
appropriate
way
.
like
the
chairman
,
I
welcome
the
investment
in
public
transport
that
the
minister
mention
.
I
be
someone
who
love
use
the
train
.
the
two
proposal
be
not
mutually
exclusive
.
my
final
point
be
on
EirGrid
and
the
interconnector
.
everyone
see
the
interconnector
's
potential
.
the
point
at
which
landfall
take
place
be
in
east
Cork
.
there
be
resident
in
the
little
area
around
Churchtown
and
Roxborough
who
have
express
concern
.
if
possible
,
will
the
minister
use
he
good
office
to
intercede
with
EirGrid
,
insofar
as
that
be
appropriate
,
to
ensure
that
there
be
no
disruption
to
the
life
of
people
live
in
that
little
pocket
?
we
all
realise
that
the
interconnector
will
be
a
vital
piece
of
infrastructure
,
as
do
the
resident
,
but
they
have
express
concern
.
the
minister
and
I
will
get
on
at
Mallow
,
travel
to
Midleton
and
have
a
wee
dram
in
Midleton
distillery
to
celebrate
that
when
it
happen
.
what
about
the
M20
?
I
thank
the
minister
and
he
official
for
they
attendance
and
engagement
with
the
committee
in
the
Dáil
Chamber
.
I
hope
it
be
productive
.
many
view
be

and
there
be
a
lot
more
work
to
be
do
.
the
meeting

.
I
will
be
brief
.
I
apologise
for
miss
the
beginning
of
the
presentation
.
along
with
deputy
Broughan
,
who
send
he
apology
,
I
have
already
meet
Mr.
Roche
and
Mr.
Bonham
.
as
a
representative
of
a
rural
constituency
that
have
see
the
benefit
of
this
programme
,
I
would
like
to
restate
the
Labour
Party
's
support
for
it
.
the
intergenerational
solidarity
that
exist
when
people
live
in
tight
and
small
community
have
diminish
over
the
year
as
people
have
disperse
.
many
old
people
who
reside
on
they
own
be
unable
to
drive
or
have
stop
drive
over
recent
year
—
they
child
may
have
fly
the
nest
to
live
in
Dublin
and
other
far
-
flung
place
—
and
therefore
depend
on
rural
transport
service
.
if
one
consider
this
matter
rationally
,
it
be
clear
that
the
budgetary
provision
of
€
11
million
that
have
be
make
be
no
more
than
a
drop
in
the
ocean
in
the
grand
scheme
of
thing
.
one
of
the
benefit
of
the
existence
of
the
rural
transport
scheme
be
the
social
solidarity
it
engender
.
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
travel
on
the
Blackwater
-
Avondhu
service
last
Thursday
morning
,
in
the
company
of
a
bunch
of
the
fine
people
one
be
ever
likely
to
meet
.
such
country
people
,
who
be
the
salt
of
the
earth
,
could
be
describe
as
we
own
people
.
they
benefit
from
they
interaction
with
similar
people
as
they
access
service
which
they
would
not
have
be
able
to
access
before
now
.
common
sense
say
that
it
be
practical
and
worthwhile
to
defend
such
service
.
as
someone
with
a
background
in
economics
,
I
be
aware
that
it
be
sometimes
call
"
the
dismal
science
"
.
I
suppose
there
be
a
sense
in
which
economist
apply
a
certain
rationale
to
how
thing
be
do
.
they
sometimes
extract
the
human
benefit
from
that
rationale
.
I
suggest
that
the
production
of
the
McCarthy
report
be
a
very
academic
exercise
,
which
do
not
take
account
of
the
need
to
protect
we
strong
rural
population
and
provide
the
service
that
be
need
in
rural
area
.
the
diminution
of
service
advocate
in
the
report
must
be
fight
at
a
political
level
.
I
be
here
to
support
that
fight
.
I
thank
the
delegation
for
its
contribution
.
Mr.
Jack
Roche
have
a
long
history
of
achievement
and
the
late
be
no
exception
.
I
thank
Mr.
Coppins
,
in
particular
,
for
the
good
support
he
have
receive
in
the
Department
.
I
hope
we
will
see
a
continuation
of
this
very
good
service
.
I
thank
all
the
Oireachtas
Member
in
attendance
,
include
that
who
be
not
member
of
the
committee
.
I
note
with
interest
Mr.
Nolan
's
submission
,
especially
where
he
refer
to
the
capital
investment
programme
,
say
,
"
should
additional
funding
be
allocate
follow
the
mid-term
review
of
the
plan
,
TII
will
look
at
the
potential
to
accelerate
certain
project
,
the
construction
of
additional
project
and
the
planning
of
other
,
include
the
upgrade
of
the
strategic
connection
between
Cork
and
Limerick
.
"
in
the
context
of
the
government
's
Action
Plan
for
Jobs
and
regional
economic
growth
and
development
,
the
Cork
to
Limerick
corridor
,
or
the
Atlantic
corridor
as
it
be
know
previously
,
be
a
vital
link
because
there
be
more
than
300000
job
earmark
for
that
region
in
the
action
plan
.
be
the
M20
be
actively
consider
in
discussion
between
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
,
TII
,
the
Department
of
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
and
the
minister
in
term
of
ensure
that
the
project
,
which
be
so
vital
to
the
economic
and
social
interest
of
the
people
in
the
south
,
south
west
and
west
,
be
progress
?
be
there
any
potential
for
money
to
be
make
available
on
the
basis
of
the
submission
that
have
be
make
to
this
committee
?
the
witness
have
say
that
it
can
take
five
year
to
achieve
planning
approval
for
major
road
project
.
they
also
say
that
we
risk
have
a
shortage
of
approve
project
for
inclusion
in
any
new
capital
investment
plan
.
failure
to
respond
to
future
need
will
lead
to
increase
congestion
.
read
between
the
line
,
TII
be
send
a
signal
that
this
project
be
vital
and
that
funding
be
require
to
get
it
through
planning
or
at
least
to
the
first
phase
.
I
be
not
talk
about
a
entire
package
of
funding
for
absolute
completion
but
funding
to
at
least
progress
the
project
.
be
there
a
funding
line
for
that
project
?
under
the
previous
capital
investment
plan
announce
by
the
last
government
there
be
a
specific
reference
to
the
relief
road
for
Mallow
.
as
everyone
know
,
Mallow
form
part
of
the
M20
corridor
.
the
people
of
Mallow
and
north
Cork
want
to
know
when
they
can
expect
to
see
that
work
start
.
they
also
want
to
know
if
TII
,
the
Department
and
the
minister
be
consider
the
question
of
dovetail
the
two
project
.
how
will
the
two
project
coalesce
?
there
be
a
understanding
on
all
side
of
the
need
for
the
M20
Cork
to
Limerick
project
.
that
be
understand
by
everybody
in
a
apolitical
sense
but
the
question
be
,
"
when
?
"
.
the
submission
to
the
committee
today
suggest
that
a
political
decision
on
funding
will
be
vital
in
order
to
get
the
project
off
the
starting
block
.
I
want
to
acknowledge
the
constructive
engagement
I
have
have
with
TII
on
national
secondary
road
.
notwithstanding
the
dearth
of
funding
that
be
available
for
such
road
there
have
be
some
improvement
to
the
N72
and
the
N73
in
the
north
Cork
area
of
late
.
however
,
further
funding
be
require
for
this
road
.
there
be
a
serious
public
safety
issue
,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
link
which
serve
as
a
corridor
west
of
Mallow
for
connectivity
onward
to
Dublin
.
it
be
a
vital
transport
corridor
but
there
be
part
of
that
national
secondary
road
that
be
so
narrow
that
two
lorry
try
to
pass
each
other
would
have
to
slow
down
to
5
kmph
to
do
so
safely
.
I
be
make
the
case
for
further
investment
from
a
road
safety
point
of
view
and
ask
that
this
be
actively
consider
and
prioritise
in
the
TII
budget
line
in
co-operation
with
Cork
County
Council
.
to
reiterate
my
early
point
,
if
it
take
five
year
to
achieve
planning
approval
for
major
road
project
such
as
the
M20
then
we
need
a
signal
now
from
TII
that
it
be
engage
with
the
Department
on
the
Cork
to
Limerick
section
of
the
route
.
we
need
to
see
some
progress
make
.
be
it
appropriate
for
I
to
seek
clarification
?
effectively
,
Mr.
Nolan
be
say
that
this
progress
significantly
in
that
resource
have
be
make
available
to
get
the
M20
,
Cork
to
Limerick
,
back
on
the
planning
agenda
.
thank
you
,
Chairman
,
for
you
indulgence
on
this
matter
.
it
be
a
vital
piece
of
infrastructure
.
the
witness
mention
the
abolition
of
quota
and
,
perhaps
,
go
back
to
a
blank
page
again
because
the
previous
route
that
have
be
select
might
have
to
be
revise
.
that
be
not
to
put
word
into
he
mouth
.
as
I
say
previously
,
there
be
a
situation
with
the
Mallow
relief
road
.
it
be
a
vital
dovetail
to
this
project
.
that
be
the
view
of
the
Mallow
Development
Partnership
,
which
be
a
stakeholder
group
,
and
Dairygold
co-operative
Society
Ltd.
,
one
of
the
big
dairy
co-operative
in
the
country
.
with
the
abolition
of
milk
quota
,
there
be
talk
about
massive
drying
plant
in
Mallow
and
Mitchelstown
.
the
vehicular
issue
in
Mallow
arise
from
agricultural
transport
and
milk
production
will
be
vital
.
that
be
the
reason
the
thinking
behind
the
northern
relief
road
,
in
term
of
dovetail
into
the
M20
project
,
will
be
important
.
I
be
not
say
the
witness
will
have
the
wisdom
of
Solomon
on
that
at
this
juncture
for
the
purpose
of
this
committee
,
but
I
seek
a
sense
from
he
of
how
that
project
will
progress
now
.
I
be
glad
the
deputy
be
come
around
to
my
way
of
think
.
I
also
ask
about
the
N72
and
N73
.
I
would
like
a
reply
about
the
road
safety
issue
.
ideally
Mr.
Nolan
should
drive
the
stretch
of
road
between
Mitchelstown
and
Mallow
.
we
all
acknowledge
the
work
on
section
of
the
road
between
Mallow
and
Fermoy
and
Mallow
and
Mitchelstown
but
there
be
still
section
which
be
very
unsafe
.
that
be
the
ideal
time
to
drive
it
to
see
how
bad
it
be
.
I
thank
Mr.
Nolan
.
I
be
conscious
the
witness
have
be
here
for
almost
two
and
a
half
hour
at
this
stage
.
I
have
hope
to
raise
two
issue
today
but
instead
I
will
ask
the
witness
to
provide
a
write
update
to
the
committee
.
the
first
issue
be
we
winter
readiness
preparation
.

a
week

ask
for
a

on
what
have
be
do
to
prepare
for
any

the

issue
be

I
thank
Senator
Hoey
for
allow
I
to
deputise
on
she
behalf
at
this
meeting
.
how
many
bed
be
situate
in
the
Owenacurra
centre
?
how
many
bed
be
register
for
respite
?
would
the
family
of
resident
who
stay
at
the
centre
for
short
period
have
class
that
stay
as
respite
or
inpatient
?
I
suggest
to
the
witness
that
we
have
to
be
very
careful
about
language
here
because
there
be
a
expectation
within
the
community
that
there
be
a
respite
provision
.
we
can
use
all
of
the
euphemistic
language
that
we
like
.
the
HSE
's
understanding
may
be
that
they
be
technically
not
respite
bed
,
but
they
be
know
and
understand
within
the
community
to
be
respite
bed
.
notwithstanding
that
that
bed
may
not
have
be
occupy
over
the
period
of
the
pandemic
,
I
suggest
to
the
HSE
that
in
close
this
centre
it
be
remove
a
massive
respite
service
and
that
be
go
to
have
a
knock
-
on
effect
for
the
people
of
Midleton
,
Youghal
,
Cobh
and
further
afield
.
what
consideration
be
the
HSE
give
to
St.
Stephen
's
Hospital
as
a
alternative
setting
for
some
of
the
resident
of
the
Owenacurra
centre
?
I
beg
the
chair
's
protection
.
I
do
not
wish
to
sound
rude
,
but
allow
I
to
rephrase
the
question
.
be
the
HSE
,
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
consider
St.
Stephen
's
Hospital
as
a
alternative
accommodation
for
current
resident
of
the
Owenacurra
centre
?
can
I
take
it
that
the
HSE
be
consider
St.
Stephen
's
Hospital
and
,
possibly
,
St.
Catherine
's
centre
as
well
?
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
HSE
be
consider
all
of
the
need
of
all
of
the
patient
,
I
put
it
to
the
HSE
and
to
the
clinical
director
that
take
people
out
of
the
Owenacurra
single
room
setting
on
the
basis
that
room
size
be
too
small
,
as
identify
in
the
Mental
Health
Commission
report
,
and
put
they
into
a
ward
setting
be
a
Dickensian
and
backward
step
and
be
not
in
the
interest
of
the
resident
.
I
hope
the
HSE
be
not
consider
that
as
a
option
.
I
be
no
therapist
or
clinician
,
but
I
know
from
talk
to
the
family
that
from
a
therapeutic
point
of
view
,
that
would
be
a
very
poor
step
.
I
ask
Mr.
Fitzgerald
to
respond
.
if
he
can
tell
I
that
the
HSE
be
not
consider
St.
Stephen
's
Hospital
as
a
option
,
a
lot
of
people
will
be
very
relieved
.
be
the
Mental
Health
Commission
currently
do
a
review
of
St.
Stephen
's
Hospital
?
have
the
Mental
Health
Commission
be
in
touch
with
the
HSE
in
respect
of
St.
Stephen
's
Hospital
?
be
Mr.
Fitzgerald
aware
of
whether
the
Mental
Health
Commission
have
visit
St.
Stephen
's
Hospital
?
in
term
of
where
I
be
come
from
on
this
,
Cois
Alla
in
Kanturk
cover
a
geographical
area
,
Solas
Nua
cover
Mallow
,
the
Carrigabrick
service
cover
Fermoy
and
the
Carrigmore
service
cover
Cork
.
what
the
HSE
be
do
in
close
Owenacurra
centre
be
to
de
facto
take
out
a
massive
geographical
area
in
term
of
residential
capability
,
include
respite
and
short
-
term
capability
.
that
be
the
message
that
be
be
send
to
the
family
.
as
a
committee
,
we
have
to
speak
for
the
family
.
the
witness
may
argue
that
we
be
be
rhetorical
in
do
so
,
but
we
empathise
and
sympathise
with
the
family
on
the
basis
that
we
share
they
concern
and
fear
that
this
process
,
which
start
in
June
and
be
to
be
a
four
-
month
process
,
be
too
short
.
not
enough
time
or
consideration
have
be
give
to
all
of
the
factor
involve
such
that
every
person
can
be
happy
that
whatever
transition
he
or
she
make
will
be
safe
for
he
or
she
,
but
that
if
there
be
any
question
mark
over
the
process
,
a
break
will
be
put
on
it
.
the
minister
should
intervene
directly
on
this
issue
.
at
this
stage
,
we
have
all
be
in
contact
with
he
about
this
.
there
need
to
be
pause
for
thought
and
reflection
about
whether
we
be
send
resident
who
have
make
huge
progress
from
a
therapeutic
point
of
view
backwards
instead
of
forward
into
life
.
we
should
not
be
provide
service
in
a
setting
that
be
further
away
from
where
they
live
and
where
they
family
be
.
do
the
witness
understand
that
fear
?
they
be
legitimate
fear
on
the
part
of
people
and
we
be
try
to
reflect
they
to
the
witness
.
I
refer
again
to
the
service
in
Kanturk
,
Mallow
,
Fermoy
and
Carrigmore
.
they
be
set
within
the
town
and
they
be
fit
for
purpose
,
although
I
accept
there
be
issue
with
they
from
time
to
time
in
term
of
meet
the
full
panoply
of
regulation
.
I
be
not
convinced
.
we
have
hear
here
from
every
single
member
across
the
political
divide
that
there
need
to
be
some
pause
for
reflection
on
this
.
quite
frankly
,
the
witness
have
not
fully
articulate
the
issue
of
the
cost
of
replacement
.
they
state
that
they
have
produce
a
internal
report
.
however
,
it
be
unconscionable
that
the
HSE
should
come
to
this
committee
without
anticipate
a
question
from
one
or
all
member
as
to
how
much
would
it
cost
to
do
the
repair
and
refurbishment
,
as
well
as
on
the
cost
of
a
replacement
building
on
that
site
.
the
HSE
have
significant
capital
resource
to
do
that
.
we
do
not
want
a
situation
follow
this
decision
whereby
people
in
the
east
Cork
region
who
need
access
to
mental
health
service
will
be
leave
bereft
.
I
ask
that
the
HSE
pause
and
reflect
on
this
decision
.
they
have
give
four
month
's
notice
.
if
you
be
kick
a
dog
out
of
the
kennel
,
you
would
give
he
more
notice
than
you
have
give
some
of
this
people
to
be
out
of
they
home
.
I
be
sorry
if
I
sound

I
thank
the

again
for
raise
this
matter
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
matter
.
as
the
Senator
have
raise
the
issue
of
the
job
loss
at
GlaxoSmithKline
,
it
be
important
for
we
to
join
with
he
in
acknowledge
the
addition
to
the
number
unemployed
in
Dungarvan
.
I
acknowledge
what
the
Senator
be
say
in
that
regard
and
I
join
with
he
,
although
I
do
not
want
to
give
just
platitude
,
in
extend
we
sympathy
to
that
family
.
I
have
listen
to
he
comment
about
the
recommendation
of
the
report
of
the
Oireachtas
Joint
committee
on
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
.
I
must
note
for
the
record
that
the
Senator
's
Oireachtas
colleague
deputy
Ciara
Conway
also
contact
I
today
about
the
GlaxoSmithKline
announcement
.
I
be
tell
that
while
the
headcount
reduction
be
regrettable
—
there
be
no
question
about
that
—
the
company
's
aim
be
to
remain
focus
on
the
long
-
term
future
of
the
site
,
ensure
that
it
remain
competitive
.
although
the
site
remain
strategic
within
the
company
's
network
,
the
company
must
continue
to
control
its
cost
base
and
be
more
flexible
because
of
global
trend
.
that
be
the
line
come
from
the
company
on
this
.
it
be
easy
for
we
as
minister
to
stand
here
and
say
this
be
down
to
a
global
phenomenon
,
but
a
foreign
direct
investment
company
be
particularly
subject
to
retrenchment
in
term
of
its
cost
base
,
especially
if
it
be
compete
against
other
aspect
of
its
own
structure
,
and
it
be
appropriate
for
it
to
reduce
its
cost
.
the
unfortunate
thing
about
that
be
the
result
job
loss
.
if
it
do
have
a
programme
of
retrenchment
,
the
important
thing
be
that
the
company
make
itself
sustainable
so
it
can
preserve
the
remain
job
.
we
must
try
we
good
to
work
with
the
State
agency
in
that
regard
.
I
have
note
the
report
refer
to
by
the
Senator
,
which
be
produce
in
2008
,
a
time
when
the
country
as
a
whole
be
face
immense
challenge
.
we
all
know
that
job
creation
be
central
to
we
economic
recovery
and
it
will
be
clear
from
the
programme
for
government
that
job
creation
be
at
the
core
of
the
government
's
policy
.
the
role
of
my
Department
be
to
ensure
we
have
the
right
policy
in
place
to
support
and
enlarge
we
enterprise
base
in
order
to
facilitate
job
creation
and
job
retention
.
the
job
initiative
announce
on
10
May
focus
we
limited
resource
on
measure
that
offer
the
great
potential
for
expansion
and
employment
creation
.
the
initiative
represent
a
positive
intervention
to
support
that
entrepreneur
and
business
people
who
will
create
job
and
rebuild
we
economy
.
the
key
element
be
the
retention
of
the
12.5
%
corporation
tax
and
the
introduction
of
a
new
,
temporary
,
second
reduce
rate
of
vat
to
apply
primarily
to
restaurant
and
catering
service
,
hotel
and
holiday
accommodation
and
various
entertainment
service
.
I
hope
this
reduction
be
adhere
to
in
Waterford
especially
in
recent
week
with
the
visit
of
the
tall
ship
and
I
hope
that
the
hospitality
sector
there
have
do
well
out
of
it
.
we
hope
be
that
this
will
continue
.
other
element
include
the
halving
of
the
low
rate
of
employer
prsi
on
earnings
of
up
to
€356
per
week
;
the
focus
of
the
State
's
capital
expenditure
towards
more
employment
-
intensive
project
in
the
area
of
education
,
local
and
regional
road
and
sustainable
transport
project
;
and
the
provision
of
a
extra
20900
activation
place
for
the
unemployed
.
the
job
initiative
be
a
important
first
step
in

this

some

there
may

we
might
not

the

this
be
about

.
the
cost
of

be
€
3.3
million
.
however
,
the
money
be
borrow
from
the
IMF
and
put
into
the
bank
,
the
cost
of
the
bailout
to
the
State
and
the
profit
which
we
European
partner
will
make
will
be
in
the
region
of
€9
billion
.
yet
,
such
company
be
struggle
and
need

.

I
will
now
deal
with
the
issue
of
prioritise

in

to

on

.
the
government
be
commit
to
ensure
that
we
get

maximum
return
on

in

.
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise

,
together
with
Forfás
,
be
lead
a
whole
of

to
identify
area
of

with
the
great
potential
to

with
a
view
to
the
government
prioritise
public

in
science
,
technology
and
innovation
to
support
the
realisation
of
opportunity
in
that
area
.
we
be
expect
a
final
report
on
this
issue
soon
from
the
steering
group
under
the
chairmanship
of
Mr.
Jim
O'Hara
.
there
may
be
a
shift
of
emphasis
towards
realise
more
economic
output
for
that
prioritisation
exercise
.
in
addition
,
there
be
a
strong
sense
that
one
must
not
compromise
the
educational
value
of
basic
research
.
there
be
a
strong
need
for
a
balance
between
basic
research
,
apply
research
and
the
necessity
to
commercialise
output
.
the
strategic
development
of
research
centre
across
the
system
will
be
inform
by
the
research
prioritisation
finding
.
I
mention
one
other
priority
to
which
I
would
now
like
to
return
,
that
be
,
ensure
that
graduate
in
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
math
,
STEM
,
have
the
relevant
skill
that
be
applicable
in
the
current
employment
market
.
this
be
a
issue
which
cut
across
the
two
Department
in

I
serve

be

engage
in
initiative
to
deliver
on
that
priority
.
my
concern
be
twofold
:
first
,
to
deliver

to
we

workforce
;
and
,
second
,
to
deliver
qualified
and
quality
personnel
to
take
up

emerge
in
foreign
direct
investment
enterprise
and
indigenous
Irish
enterprise
.
we
be
also
pursue
the
provision
of
highly
skilled
employment
by
reposition
Irish
enterprise
high
up
the
value
chain
.
the
high
education
system
have
be
successful
in
produce
science
graduate
for
the
labour
market
.
the
late
OECD
datum
show
that
graduation
rate
for
science
graduate
be
high
,
on
average
,
in
Ireland
compare
to
other
country
.
unfortunately
,
high
education
have
not
be
as
successful
with
engineering
as
a
result
of
low
student
demand
for
this
course
.
however
,
there
have
be
a
increase
demand
for
stem
course
in
recent
year
.
although
the
overall
number
of
applicant
through
the
CAO
have
remain
stable
since
2010
,
there
have
be
a
significant
redistribution
of
first

Senator
will
be
aware
of
recent
comment
regard
the
global
rank
of
Irish
university
.
it
be
worth
note
that
while
some
high
education
system
have
invest
heavily
in
elite
institution
and
adopt
a
policy
of
differentiate
support
for
different
tier
of
institution
,
we
focus
be
on
sustain
and
advance
performance
throughout
the
system
.
in
this
regard
,
we
can
draw
encouragement
from
the
overall
performance
of
the
Irish
system
in
the
late
Times
High
Education
system
performance
table
which
place
Ireland
firmly
in
the
world
's
top
20
.
we
be
rank
17th
overall
and
sixth
in
the
world
relative
to
gdp
.
I
sincerely
thank
the
Cathaoirleach
and
Senator
for
give
I
the
opportunity
to
discuss
this
topic
.
I
hope
Senator
will
be
reassure
by
the
government
's
commitment
to
the
science
,
technology
and
innovation
agenda
.
my
sense
be
that
it
transcend
party
political
boundary
,
that
it
be
one
in
which
successive
government
,
no
matter
they
hue
,
have
realise
the
potential
,
and
that
it
will
form
the
bedrock
of
we
economic
recovery
.
we
must
ensure
there
be
collaboration
among
public
representative
,
include
senator
,
deputy
and
minister
.
I
be
keen
to
ensure
I
hear
from
Senator
on
any
view
they
have
on
this
agenda
to
allow
we
to
make
it
world
class
,
as
we
be
ambitious
in
we
aim
.
I
will
meander
through
the
contribution
in
no
particular
order
.
I
will
start
with
Senator
Thomas
Byrne
.
I
be
suppose
he
have
not
read
the
qualitative
criterion
lay
down
by
the
the
Times
High
Education
review
in
how
it
quantify
university
ranking
.
Senator
Barrett
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
in
regard
to
the
ranking
.
nobody
in
the
government
be
commit
himself
or
herself
to
mediocrity
.
we
must
be
honest
about
this
thing
and
the
ECF
have
have
a
bear
on
the
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
and
that
have
have
a
bear
on
the
quantitative
criterion
lay
down
in
regard
to
ranking
and
hence
the
headline
.
I
take
the
point
Senator
Barrett
make
in
regard
to
the
scientific
agenda
.
I
do
not
believe
we
be
swallow
hook
,
line
and
sinker
everything
say
to
we
by
the
agency
.
that
be
not
the
case
.
I
assure
the
Senator
that
we
be
critically
assess
everything
that
be
come
across
we
desk
because
it
be
not
a
case
of
continue
on
as
before
.
I
recognise
and
acknowledge
the
role
of
previous
government
in
regard
to
the
science
,
technology
and
innovation
agenda
because
it
be
dominate
and
inform
by
industry
,
academia
and
by
previous
government
.
while
I
would
not
go
as
far
as
follow
the
McCarthy
report
,
because
I
contend
that
it
too
have
its
own
agenda
,
there
be
a
sense
that
we
must
critically
assess
everything
come
across
we
desk
.
that
be
why
we
bring
in
somebody
like
Jim
O'Hara
on
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
because
the
clear
emphasis
of
that
exercise
will
be
towards
gain
more
economic
output
.
that
will
run
parallel
with
the
legislation
underpin
Science
Foundation
Ireland
whereby
one
can
extend
the
remit
towards
more
apply
research
and
the
economic
agenda
we
want
to
fulfil
.
I
agree
that
we
need
to
slaughter
some
sacred
cow
within
academia
.
certain
institution
be
able
to
attract
massive
amount
of
money
and
issue
arise
in
term
of
the
duplication
of
research
.
we
have
to
grapple
with
this
issue
in
the
forthcoming
period
,
but
my
starting
point
will
be
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
.
I
want
to
ensure
we
gain
access
to
the
metric
arise
from
this
.
a
process
be
under
way
within
the
Department
in
extrapolate
information
from
various
agency
,
include
SFI
,
the
research
council
and
Enterprise
Ireland
.
this
will
also
form
part
of
the
expenditure
review
of
this
agency
's
budget
.
we
will
hear
more
about
this
at
budget
time
.
I
assure
that
Senator
who
express
criticism
of
the
policy
that
we
be
mindful
of
the
issue
arise
,
although
I
continue
to
believe
we
need
a
strong
base
for
basic
and
apply
research
.
if
we
lose
that
base
,
we
will
compromise
we
ability
to
attract
foreign
direct
investment
.
a
significant
number
of
exist
job
be
underpin
by
increase
collaboration
across
industry
and
between
industry
and
academia
,
which
be
a
positive
development
.
Senator
Clune
refer
to
the
economic
output
which
be
we
current
focus
.
we
can
no
long
sustain
a
position
where
people
make
call
for
proposal
within
the
research
community
in
the
absence
of
at
least
some
qualitative
criterion
to
ensure
there
be
output
for
the
research
.
we
be
conscious
of
the
need
to
ensure
value
for
money
.
on
Senator
Barrett
's
point
,
I
share
the
instinctive
view
that
the
entity
could
be
further
consolidate
.
perhaps
that
reflect
the
opinion
of
a
agnostic
;
like
the
good
Senator
,
I
also
have
a
economics
background
.
one
think
in
a
certain
way
about
the
possibility
of
slaughter
some
of
the
sacred
cow
within
we
hallow
institution
.
that
would
be
a
easy
thing
to
do
,
but
I
be
not
sure
if
it
would
achieve
much
.
I
be
often
tell
that
Stanford
University
have
the
same
number
of
undergraduate
as
the
island
of
Ireland
,
although
I
be
not
sure
if
that
be
true
.
my
instinct
suggest
we
should
be
striving
towards
the
centre
of
excellence
to
which
Senator
Byrne
refer
.
the
question
arise
as
to
whether
a
government
could
force
the
consolidation
of
entity
,
but
there
be
far
great
collaboration
between
entity
on
research
and
innovation
than
heretofore
.
there
be
also
close
collaboration
between
the
university
and
the
institute
of
technology
than
I
have
see
previously
.
this
be
a
welcome
development
.
one
get
from
institute
such
as
CRANN
and
the
Tyndall
Institute
a
strong
sense
of
collaboration
with
industry
in
order
to
achieve
output
.
theirs
be
output
focus
and
result
drive
research
.
Cork
Institute
of
Technology
and
the
Telecommunications
Software
and
System
Group
in
Waterford
be
also
use
they
funding
to
collaborate
with
industry
in
achieve
the
necessary
economic
output
.
on
the
issue
of
broadband
in
school
,
there
be
ongoing
engagement
between
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
and
Education
and
Skill
.
however
,
the
question
arise
whether
it
be
necessary
for
every
school
to
have
100
mb
.
I
do
not
believe
it
be
.
we
have
sufficient
capacity
to
provide
between
10
mb
and
15
mb
and
if
school
need
great
bandwidth
,
they
can
draw
from
this
resource
.
the
issue
be
be
discuss
and
the
two
minister
be
aware
of
the
need
to
address
this
agenda
.
I
apologise
if
I
be
unable
to
answer
every
question
pose
today
.
I
will
,
however
,
address
the
issue
arise
with
the
Member
concerned
if
they
so
agree
.
Senator
O'Keeffe
and
Crown
raise
specific
issue
.
my
door
be
open
and
I
be
happy
to
help
member
to
address
this
and
other
specific
issue
.
I
thank
Senator
for
give
I
the
opportunity
to
address
they
.
be
this
on
the
adjournment
?
I
would
be
happy
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
Senator
on
a
future
occasion
.
I
repeat
that
the
government
be
commit
to
ensure
the
future
of
Connolly
Hospital
.
as
I
say
,
there
be
no
proposal
to
downgrade
the
hospital
.
it
be
important
for
the
Senator
not
to
be
disingenuous
when
deal
with
this
issue
.
more
than
anybody
else
,
he
should
know

no

towards

,
be

there
be

the

for

deputy
Reilly
,
have
make

very

must
live

.
they

I
thank
the

for
bring
this
project
to
my
attention
.
literacy
and
numeracy
be
among
the
most
important
life
skill
teach
in
school
.
we
be
determined
that
no
child
should
leave
school
without
have
master
this
skill
to
the
good
of
he
or
she
ability
.
that
be
why
the
minister
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
launch
the
national
literacy
strategy
on
8
July
last
.
ensure
that
all
young
people
achieve
high
standard
of
literacy
and
numeracy
be
one
of
the
key
aim
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
the
minister
.
the
key
to
the
success
of
the
literacy
and
numeracy
strategy
will
be
the
engagement
of
the
whole
community
in
ensure
that
the
strategy
be
fully
implement
.
develop
literacy
and
numeracy
be
not
the
business
of
school
alone
,
and
family
and
community
also
play
a
key
role
by
set
high
expectation
,
provide
good
role
model
for
learner
and
provide
every
opportunity
for
child
and
young
people
to
become
more
proficient
in
literacy
and
numeracy
.
the
literacy
and
numeracy
strategy
acknowledge
the
important
role
that
library
can
play
in
support
community
,
family
and
young
learner
to
develop
good
literacy
.
library
and
librarian
be
a
important
resource
in
support
child
's
literacy
and
public
library
service
have
be
to
the
fore
in
promote
reading
over
many
year
.
Public
library
enable
family
to
support
they
child
's
literacy
development
through
the
range
of
resource
and
information
they
make
available
in
a
free
,
open
and
informal
setting
.
whereas
library
be
a
excellent
resource
for
all
family
,
they
can
be
of
particular
assistance
to
family
who
find
it
difficult
to
meet
the
cost
of
provide
a
rich
range
of
book
and
educational
resource
in
the
home
.
the
project
refer
to
by
the
Senator
,
base
in
the
Oranmore
branch
of
County
Galway
library
service
to
support
child
in
develop
they
reading
skill
,
be
a
very
fine
example
of
what
we
have
in
mind
in
the
literacy
strategy
.
we
compliment
the
Senator
on
the
leadership
and
commitment
to
voluntary
effort
that
she
have
show
in
initiate
this
project
,
in
organise
the
participation
of
child
in
the
workshop
and
in
build
fruitful
co-operation
with
the
library
service
.
from
what
I
know
of
the
project
,
it
be
a
example
of
a
public
library
put
its
resource
at
the
disposal
of
young
learner
to
give
they
a
opportunity
to
learn
to
read
and
to
love
to
read
.
I
wholeheartedly
compliment
the
library
service
on
its
involvement
in
this
initiative
and
also
the
young
teacher
who
be
voluntarily
give
they
time
to
support
the
project
.
I
fully
support
community
-
base
intervention
project
that
support
literacy
and
numeracy
.
the
project
give
child
the
opportunity
to
select
book
with
expert
guidance
from
professional
librarian
and
the
child
be
assist
in
learn
to
read
the
book
with
professional
guidance
from
teacher
.
I
be
delighted
to
hear
from
the
Senator
that
she
believe
it
be
successful
and
the
minister
have
ask
the
inspectorate
of
the
Department
to
visit
the
project
in
order
to
provide
a
detailed
report
for
I
on
how
it
work
,
the
profile
of
child
who
be
involve
,
the
activity
organised
and
the
impact
that
the
project
be
have
on
child
's
learning
and
reading
habit
.
in
the
brief
time
leave
I
should
clarify
that
any
accreditation
with
regard
to
teaching
practice
for
trainee
teacher
be
a
matter
for
the
Teaching
Council
.
I
take
on
board
the
Senator
's
comment
regard
lateral
thinking
be
apply
to
the
project
,
which
be
to
be
welcome
.
I
contend
that
if
there
be
a
visit
by
the
senior
inspectorate
,
we
would
proceed
from
there
as
such
engagement
be
positive
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
condition
for
registration
as
a
teacher
be
a
matter
for
the
Teaching
Council
,
not
necessarily
the
minister
.
the
supervisory
role
relate
to
teacher
in
training
would
be
deem
a
matter
for
a
school
principal
.
that
be
not
a
negative
reply
but
rather
a
suggestion
that
the
Senator
could
have
engagement
arise
from
the
impending
visit
by
the
inspector
.
more
lateral
thinking
should
also
be
apply
.
I
wish
the
Senator
well
in
the
endeavour
and
we
should
support
it
in
so
far
as
we
be
able
,
although
we
should
be
mindful
of
some
of
the
constraint
the
Department
may
be
under
because
of
its
competence
and
that
of
the
Teaching
Council
with
initiative
such
as
this
.
I
take
the
Senator
's
point
.
the
project
,
by
dint
of
she
involvement
and
active
participation
,
will
survive
on
its
own
merit
.
it
will
do
so
owe
to
the
number
of
stakeholder
and
the
commitment
of
the
people
involve
.
if
there
be
to
be
engagement
on
accreditation
,
it
will
solely
be
a
matter
for
the
Teaching
Council
.
if
this
could
be
refer
to
the
inspector
in
the
course
of
a
impending
visit
,
the
relevant
conversation
should
take
place
.
if
the
Senator
make
representation
to
the
Teaching
Council
,
which
be
a
independent
body
,
it
could
be
a
way
of

access

certain
social

,
which
be
base
on

,
differ
between

while

the
rate

in
respect

a
combine
14.75
%

per

under
the
full

rate
.
as
a
result
,
ordinary

can
build
entitlement
towards
the
full
range
of
social

on
the
high

as

or
survive

's
contributory
pension
.
I
be
keenly
aware
of
the
very
difficult
financial
position
self
-
employ
people
be
now
in
.
we
have
all
hear
case
in
we
clinic
and
advice
centre
,
in
particular
small
business
owner
who
find
themselves
in
a
very
precarious
financial
position
.
however
,
we
have
to
strike
a
balance
between
contribution
make
and
benefit
receive
.
prsi
coverage
be
related
to
the
risk
associate
with
employment
or
self
-
employment
,
the
annualised
system
of
contribution
for
self
-
employ
people
and
the
practicality
of
administer
and
control
access
to
short
-
term
payment
for
self
-
employ
people
.
a
system
of
separate
arrangement
for
employ
and
self
-
employ
worker
within
the
social
insurance
context
,
such
as
this
,
be
common
in
other
European
social
protection
system
.
in
this
context
,
it
should
be
note
that
self
-
employ
worker
generally
achieve
good
value
for
money
by
pay
social
insurance
compare
with
employee
.
the
2005
actuarial
review
of
the
social
insurance
fund
find
it
favour
the
self
-
employ
over
the
employ
when
employer
and
employee
contribution
be
include
in
respect
of
the
employ
person
.
for
example
,
a
male
marry
self
-
employ
contributor
earn
gross
average
industrial
wage
have
a
value
for
money
index
of
10.3
compare
with
a
index
of
3.1
for
a
equivalent
employee
.
in
basic
term
this
mean
that
,
with
regard
to
benefit
,
the
self
-
employ
contributor
can
expect
to
receive
over
ten
time
what
he
or
she
contribute
to
the
social
insurance
fund
compare
to
the
employee
who
,
even
with
access
to
a
broad
range
of
benefit
,
only
get
three
time
what
he
or
she
and
he
or
she
employer
contribute
.
the
analysis
demonstrate
that
,
despite
the
fact
that
they
be
eligible
for
a
narrow
range
of
benefit
,
self
-
employ
person
can
gain
substantially
more
from
the
fund
than
employee
.
it
should
be
note
that
the
State
contributory
pension
increase
in
excess
of
inflation
and
earnings
growth
in
the
period
up
to
2010
while
annuity
offer
cpi
link
increase
at
good
.
the
market
cost
of
a
inflation
link
annuity
with
€
12,000
a
year
in
initial
benefit
be
in
excess
of
€
300000
,
without
any
associate
survivor
's
benefit
.
any
change
to
the
prsi
system
in
order
to
provide
access
to
short
-
term
benefit
such
as
social
insurance
illness
-
related
benefit
would
have
significant
financial
implication
and
would
have
to
be
consider
in
the
context
of
a
much
more
significant
rise
in
the
rate
of
contribution
payable
.
the
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Joan
Burton
,
establish
the
advisory
group
on
tax
and
social
welfare
early
this
year
to
meet
the
commitment
make
in
the
programme
for
government
.
it
will
examine
and
report
on
issue
involve
in
provide
social
insurance
cover
for
self
-
employ
person
in
order
to
establish
whether
it
be
technically
feasible
and
financially
sustainable
.
I
be
happy
to
make
a
submission
in
light
of
the
concern
raise
.
the
State
have
to
be
mindful
of
the
cost
of
implement
such
a
scheme
,
in
term
of
derive
short
-
term
benefit
.
I
take
the
point
make
on
the
advisory
group
on
tax
and
social
welfare
.
I
will
refer
the
matter
to
the

for

however
,
the
first

be
to

which
will
enable

it
be
important
to
repeat
that
it
have
to

way
.
it
would
not
be
right
to
designate
a

at

,
it
must
go
through

the
first
step
be
to

on
that
performance
criterion
,
which
will
enable
institute
of

to
consider
they
future

in

.
once
a
process
be
in
place
,
it
will
be
open
to
institute
of

to
come
together
to
make
application
for

that
be
a
eminently
sensible
approach
.
all
application
,
include
any
involve
Waterford
Institute
of

,
will
be
consider
under
a
independent
assessment
process
.
this
be
a
necessary
prerequisite
of
uphold
the
quality
and
international
reputation
of
the
high

system
.
there
be
a
clear
understanding
,
on
a
cross-
party
political
basis
,
of
the
need
to
ensure
there
be
balance
regional
development
,
as
refer
to
by
Senator
Cullinane
.
I
acknowledge
during
a
recent
visit
to
Waterford
Institute
of
Technology
,
include
the
TSSG
centre
,
that
world
-
class
research
be
be
carry
out
there
.
it
be
a
exceptional
entity
of
which
people
in
the
Waterford
region
can
be
very
proud
.
the
capability
and
capacity
be
there
,
but
we
must
go
through
a
process
.
moreover
,
it
must
be
a
logical
and
inform
process
rather
than
a
knee
-
jerk
reaction
which
could
create
a
entity
that
be
not
self
-
sustain
.
we
must
ensure
that
whatever
be
create
can
sustain
itself
and
compete
with
other
institution
.
we
should
also
take
into
account
that
there
be
as
many
student
on
the
campus
of
Stanford
University
in
California
as
there
be
in
third
level
institution
throughout
the
twenty

six
County

we
must
think
relatively
and
be
careful
of
how
we
proceed
.
I

I
be
pleased
to
bring
before
the
Seanad
for
its
consideration
the
patent
(
amendment
)
Bill
2011
,
the
main
purpose
of
which
be
to
make
the
necessary
change
to
the
Patent
Act
1992
to
provide
for
the
ratification
by
Ireland
of
the
London
agreement
.
the
London
agreement
,
to
which
Ireland
be
a
signatory
,
be
aim
at
reduce
the
cost
of
the
European
patent
process
to
applicant
by
reduce
the
requirement
to
file
translation
of
the
grant
patent
under
the
European
patent
Convention
.
before
consider
the
provision
of
the
Bill
,
I
wish
to
set
out
the
background
to
it
.
it
be
clear
Ireland
's
international
competitiveness
increasingly
depend
on
marketable
high
-
value
goods
and
service
which
have
strong
knowledge
content
.
in
spite
of
the
challenging
economic
environment
,
approximately
50
%
of
all
enterprise
in
Ireland
continue
to
engage
in
significant
research
and
development
activity
.
a
recent
report
show
that
enterprise
across
all
business
sector
spend
almost
€
1.8
billion
on
research
and
development
activity
in
2010
and
to
convert
that
investment
into
economic
growth
Ireland
need
a
effective
patent
system
.
it
be
incumbent
on
the
government
to
provide
the
very
good
framework
for
this
result
innovation
to
be
capture
and
exploit
in
a
manner
that
will
create
high
-
value
employment
.
any
unnecessary
legal
or
administrative
barrier
in
the
intellectual
property
framework
that
limit
access
owe
to
high
translation
cost
or
other
factor
will
not
serve
its
purpose
.
provide
efficient
and
affordable
access
to
register
patent
be
vital
to
stimulate
innovation
in
Irish
enterprise
,
university
and
research
institution
.
the
high
cost
of
obligatory
translation
of
grant
European
patent
act
as
a
deterrent
to
filing
patent
and
,
as
a
consequence
,
to
innovation
.
by
lower
the
current
cost
barrier
to
entry
and
enhance
sme
access
to
the
patent
system
,
the
London
agreement
represent
a
significant
step
forward
for
the
European
patent
system
.
as
for
the
London

the

should
the
relevant
condition
be
meet
.
patent
application
originate
in
Ireland
and
grant
by
the
European
patent
Office
have
be
increase
steadily
,
underline
the
importance
to
the
Irish
research
sector
,
both
public
and
private
,
of
European
patent
protection
.
since
2004
,
the
number
of
Irish
patent
application
to
the
European
patent
Office
have
risen
by48
%
,
with
grant
of
European
patent
to
Irish
applicant
increase
by
34
%
.
however
,
the
patent
process
at
European
level
be
both
complex
and
expensive
,
act
as
a
disincentive
to
innovation
,
especially
for
young
innovative
start
-
up
with
limited
resource
.
a
enterprise
endeavour
to
protect
its
innovation
throughout
Europe
will
apply
to
the
European
patent
Office
for
a
patent
.
at
this
stage
,
applicant
can
file
they
application
in
English
,
French
or
German
,
thus
save
on
translation
cost
at
this
early
stage
.
the
claim
which
set
out
the
limit
of
the
monopoly
grant
be
publish
in
the
three
language
upon
grant
.
once
grant
,
the
European
patent
be
,
in
effect
,
a
bundle
of
national
patent
and
the
proprietor
must
validate
or
file
the
patent
in
each
state
in
which
patent
protection
be
require
.
in
order
to
validate
a
European
patent
in
a
country
,
a
full
translation
of
the
patent
must
be
lodge
in
each
country
designate
in
the
national
language
of
that
country
.
this
translation
cost
make
up
a
large
proportion
of
the
cost
of
acquire
a
European
patent
and
constitute
a
cost
enterprise
can
scarcely
afford
at
a
vital
stage
of
expensive
product
development
.
this
process
ensure
the
European
patent
be
uncompetitive
when
compare
with
the
cost
of
acquire
US
or
Japanese
patent
.
under
the
current
system
,
a
European
patent
validate
in
13
European
country
be
approximately
ten
time
more
expensive
than
a
US
patent
and
13
time
more
costly
than
a
Japanese
patent
.
the
key
cost
difference
be
the
processing
and
translation
cost
involve
with
a
European
patent
.
in
this
context
,
validate
a
patent
in
27
European
country
can
cost
up
to
€
32000
,
of
which
€
23000
alone
be
for
translation
.
approximately
75
%
of
the
cost
differential
between
the
granting
of
a
European
and
US
patent
be
due
to
translation
cost
.
it
be
,
therefore
,
right
and
proper
that
this
cost
,
which
be
function
as
a
very
real
barrier
to
exploit
innovation
in
Europe
,
should
be
tackle
.
the
publication
of
the
translation
take
place
very
late
in
the
life
cycle
of
a
patent
.
as
this
translation
be
only
provide
after
the
patent
be
grant
,
they
do
not
serve
the
purpose
of
inform
the
public
about
new
technology
on
a
timely
basis
.
it
can
take
up
to
five
year
to
grant
a
patent
,
mean
that
any
cutting
-
edge
technology
describe
in
a
patent
be
usually
already
in
the
public
domain
and
rendering
the
translation
,
as
a
information
tool
,
obsolete
even
before
it
be
complete
.
research
have
show
that
this
cost
have
force
Irish
innovator
to
take
a
selective
,
cost
-
effective
approach
when
designate
state
for
patent
protection
.
this
leave
patent
vulnerable
in
that
state
where
innovator
simply
cannot
afford
to
validate
they
.
the
advantage
arise
from
implementation
of
the
London
agreement
,
quite
apart
from
the
direct
translation
cost
,
can
also
have
a
positive
effect
on
research
and
development
and
can
enable
scarce
financial
resource
currently
spend
on
translation
to
be
reallocate
to
research
and
development
and
other
business
activity
.
the
London
agreement
be
now
in
force
in
17
of
the
38
member
state
of
the
European
patent
Organisation
,
include
,
importantly
,
major
Irish
trading
market
such
as
the
UK
,
France
and
Germany
.
Ireland
hope
to
join
that
number
shortly
and
,
in
do
so
,
wish
to
encourage
other
state
to
follow
in
order
to
further
reduce
cost
for
Irish
patent
holder
register
they
innovation
throughout
Europe
.
the
overall
aim
of
the
London
agreement
be
to
reduce
the
cost
of
translation
across
the
38
member
state
by
approximately
50
%
.
to
reach
this
level
of
reduction
,
it
be
vital
that
all
contracting
state
to
the
European
patent
Convention
become
party
to
the
agreement
.
I
wish
to
outline
how
the
London
agreement
work
in
practice
.
article
65
of
the
European
patent
Convention
provide
that
any
contracting
state
may
require
a
translation
of
the
full
text
of
a
European
patent
into
one
of
its
language
,
if
that
language
be
different
from
the
language
in
which
the
patent
be
grant
.
under
the
London
agreement
,
country
will
,
either
partly
or
wholly
,
waive
the
requirement
for
translation
of
European
patent
to
be
file
in
they
national
language
.
this
mean
that
under
the
agreement
,
a
member
state
with
English
,
French
or
German
as
a
official
language
will
dispense
with
translation
requirement
entirely
in
order
to
for
the
European
patent
to
come
into
effect
.
Ireland
,
with
English
as
a
official
language
,
will
no
long
require
a
translation
into
English
of
the
detailed
specification
of
European
patent
draw
up
in
French
or
German
.
in
accordance
with
good
practice
and
to
assess
the
implication
for
Irish
inventor
and
business
,
my
Department
carry
out
a
regulatory
impact
assessment
in
respect
of
the
London
agreement
in
2009
.
this
establish
that
the
main
advantage
of
the
agreement
for
Irish
inventor
seek
patent
protection
abroad
be
that
it
would
no
long
be
necessary
for
they
to
furnish
translation
to
the
extent
currently
require
in
that
country
which
be
party
to
the
agreement
.
this
would
lead
to
significant
savings
when
file
a
European
patent
in
other
non-English
language
European
state
.
there
would
be
a
significant
reduction
not
only
in
translation
cost
but
in
the
context
of
publication
and
patent
attorney
fee
.
the
impact
assessment
also
highlight
that
in
2007
Ireland
be
the
origin
for
some
126
European
patent
that
be
grant
.
the
cost
of
designate
this
patent
in
28
state
be
estimate
at
€
6
million
.
if
the
significant
impact
of
additional
publication
and
patent
attorney
fee
be
add
,
this
represent
a
considerable
cost
to
Irish
industry
.
to
bring
Irish
law
into
line
with
the
London
agreement
,
it
be
necessary
to
amend
we
primary
legislation
.
the
core
of
Irish
patent
law
be
the
Patent
Act
1992
,
which
be
design
to
meet
we
national
need
and
international
obligation
.
we
continue
to
amend
this
primary
act
to
ensure

this
provide
some
ministerial

the
purpose
of

be
to
allow
for
any
administrative
change
which
may
be
require
before

in

,
it
be
necessary
for
the

to
be
amend
to
bring
they
into
line
with
the
London
agreement
.
the
propose
amendment

of
1992
be
be
draft
at
present
,
in
consultation
with
the
Office

Parliamentary
counsel

it
be
my
intention

the
new

rule

by
way
of
a
order
as
close
to

this
Bill
as
possible
.
the
legislation
,
as
publish
,
be
the
subject
of
one
minor
amendment
in
the
dáil
in
respect
of
section

.

245/2011
,
which
come
into
effect
on
2
June
last
.
the
Bill
before
the
House
be
just
one
of
many
step
be
take
to
reduce
the
burden
of
patent
cost
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
update
Senator
on
a
separate
development
at
EU
level
.
we
be
work
with
other
member
state
towards
finalise
legislation
for
the
creation
of
unitary
patent
protection
that
will
reduce
the
cost
of
registration
and
enforcement
of
patent
for
business
.
various
proposal
for
a
single
EU
patent
have
be
under
discussion
for
more
than
50
year
.
just
prior
to
Christmas
,
25
member
state
reach
political
agreement
with
the
European
Parliament
on
regulation
for
a
unitary
patent
.
this
will
lead
to
the
introduction
of
a
simple
,
cheap
and
more
robust
patent
system
in
the
European
Union
of
the
type
which
have
elude
it
for
decade
.
when
fully
implement
,
the
unitary
patent
will
enable
Irish
-
base
holder
of
patent
to
seek
protection
for
they
patent
across
the
25
member
state
support
unitary
patent
protection
—
represent
79
%
of
the
territory
of
the
European
Union
—
for
a
fraction
of
current
cost
.
the
European
Commission
estimate
that
by
implement
unitary
patent
protection
,
the
overall
savings
to
European
business
could
be
up
to
€
50
million
per
annum
,
even
in
the
early
stage
.
this
cost
savings
should
be
of
particular
benefit
to
Irish
high
-
tech
start
-
up
and
small
enterprise
.
when
fully
implement
,
a
unitary
patent
will
mean
large
reduction
in
red
tape
and
cost
.
this
will
stimulate
European
innovation
and
make
patent
more
accessible
to
all
company
in
the
European
Union
.
I
look
forward
to
report
back
to
the
House
when
legislation
for
this
unitary
patent
and
its
enforcement
be
finalise
.
until
a
EU
unitary
patent
come
into
force
,
perhaps
in
2014
,
Ireland
will
continue
to
improve
the
patenting
process
in
any
way
possible
.
the
Patent
(
amendment
)
Bill
2011
build
on
we
continue
effort
to
facilitate
Irish
-
base
enterprise
and
research
institution
in
they
effort
to
ensure
that
they
innovation
be
properly
protect
in
as
many
state
as
possible
and
at
the
low
cost
.
I
be
confident
the
House
will
strongly
endorse
any
initiative
which
reduce
cost
for
innovation
in
Ireland
in
a
efficient
and
inexpensive
manner
.
the
enactment
of
the
patent
(
amendment
)
Bill
2011
,
follow
by
we
ratification
of
the
London
agreement
,
will
remove
the
current
expensive
translation
requirement
.
in
addition
,
Ireland
be
likely
to
be
designate
in
more
patent
application
,
increase
overall
patent
-
related
activity
here
.
it
be
expect
that
more
inventor
and
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
currently
deter
from
register
patent
because
of
the
high
cost
involve
,
will
be
attract
to
protect
they
intellectual
property
across
Europe
.
this
will
further
support
Ireland
's
effort
to
generate
economic
growth
through
promote
and
innovate
good
process
and
product
.
I
commend
the
Bill
to
the
House
.
I
thank
Senator
for
they
great
comment
.
a
number
of
issue
have
be
raise
,
all
of
which
indirectly
relate
to
the
legislation
but
be
not
pertinent
to
today
's
process
.
generally
,
if
the
starting
point
for
innovation
be
government
policy
interact
with
State
agency
,
there
be
a
very
clear
sense
of
purpose
in
ensure
we
do
not
rest
on
we
laurel
.
the
recommendation
of
the
innovation
task
force
be
be
deal
with
in
a
ongoing
process
,
with
one
recommendation
relate
to
tax
credit
.
that
be
address
in
the
recent
budget
and
I
will
deal
with
that
in
further
detail
.
I
thank
Senator
for
they
consider
contribution
,
which
raise
issue
that
must
be
take
on
board
by
the
government
.
a
patent
be
not
the
only
measure
of
innovation
but
rather
one
of
a
number
.
the
clear
purpose
of
this
legislation
be
to
reduce
that
burden
and
put
in
place
a
European
system
,
where
Ireland
will
play
a
part
and
Irish
sme
and
other
stakeholder
can
ensure
administrative
and
legal
cost
be
reduce
as
a
result
.
in
its
complementary
policy
,
the
government
be
go
through
a
research
prioritisation
exercise
which
seek
to
build
upon
between
12
and
14
core
theme
or
area
of
research
on
which
we
must
concentrate
in
order
to
interact
with
the
State
agency
which
Senator
Crown
speak
of
,
include
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
Enterprise
Ireland
,
academic
institution
and
multinational
company
.
in
do
this
we
try
to
focus
the
amount
of
money
spend
by
the
State
on
research
in
a
way
that
ensure
the
basic
research
requirement
and
a
more
apply
approach
that
can
drive
more
economic
benefit
by
create
as
many
job
as
possible
.
Complementary
to
that
be
a
patent
process
which
ensure
that
where
a
citizen
,
researcher
or
SME
want
to
invest
in
a
new
patent
system
,
the
European
system
will
ensure
the
burden
be
not
heavy
in
cost
.
the
process
should
be
as
simple
as
possible
.
a
interesting
point
be
make
by
Senator
Mooney
regard
the
young
scientist
's
exhibition
.
when
two
people
from
a
school
in
Dublin
or
elsewhere
can
develop
algorithm
at
such
a
stage
in
they
life
,
we
must
be
bowl
over
by
the
depth
of
they
imagination
and
creativity
as
well
as
the
ecosystem
which
support
they
through
they
local
school
.
Successive
government
have
be
in
this
apolitical
space
and
no
specific
party
own
it
.
as
a
state
we
want
to
ensure
the
Irish
Patent
Office
—
representative
of
which
attend
the
exhibition
—
can
provide
people
with
the
advice
they
need
.
when
I
attend
its
stand
at
the
young
scientist
's
exhibition
,
there
be
a
phenomenal
number
of
interaction
with
student
.
the
€32000
figure
be
average
or
indicative
but
we
want
to
ensure
we
get
to
a
stage
where
people
like
the
student
in
question
plug
into
the
idea
that
there
be
a
process
for
they
innovation
which
be
not
cumbersome
.
listen
to
the
radio
interview
,
the
people
in
question
be
already
plug
into
the
space
of
patent
they
work
.
that
culture
be
change
in
student
,
who
be
become
more
aware
of
the
potential
.
it
be
not
for
the
State
to
own
all
the
intellectual
property
derive
from
the
research
in
which
it
invest
.
that
be
not
a
good
direction
to
take
and
we
do
not
want
to
create
a
disincentive
for
individual
researcher
or
company
with
a
investment
in
lab
,
for
example
.
they
should
not
have
to
give
intellectual
property
back
to
the
State
and
we
should
foster
the
creation
of
such
intellectual
property
or
patent
.
the
Forfás

with

to

in

also
because
of

.
the

I
note
the
point
make
by
Senator
Quinn
.
perhaps
we
could
engage
further
to
see
whether
there
be
possibility
in
term
of

.
the

Senator
Gilroy
make
a
point
on
the
registration
of

here
,
in
the
European

and
in

in

.

Irish

from

in
2008
to

a
increase
of
a
meagre
3

,
but
it
be
a
increase
.

the
UK
intellectual
Property
Office
rise
from
278
in
2008
to
289
in
2010
,
a
increase
of
3.9
%
.
application
for
US
patent
file
by
Irish
resident
company
increase
from
740
in
2008
to
796
in
2010
,
a
increase
of
7.5
%
.
that
trend
,
where
Irish
-
resident
company
be
file
directly
for
US
patent
,
be
due
to
the
low
cost
of
acquire
a
US
patent
compare
to
the
European
patent
system
.
I
hope
that
answer
the
point
adequately
.
on
the
unitary
patent
protection
and
the
London
agreement
;
they
be
not
mutually
exclusive
.
the
purpose
be
that
they
would
be
complementary
.
by
instigate
a
unitary
patent
system
one
would
hope
to
drive
down
further
the
cost
of
implement
patent
to
reduce
the
cost
of
registration
further
and
to
benefit
from
a
estimate
€
50
million
in
savings
.
it
be
a
mechanism
by
which
one
would
have
a
wide
European
scope
.
the
aim
be
the
same
in
that
it
complement
the
London
agreement
.
I
hope
that
clarify
the
position
.
if
it
do
not
I
be
happy
to
return
to
the
matter
on
the
next
stage
.
Senator
Crown
sum
up
the
legislation
very
well
when
he
refer
to
reduce
obstruction
,
grease
the
wheel
of
innovation
and
improve
society
.
that
be
key
to
what
we
be
do
.
it
be
part
of
that
process
.
while
the
legislation
be
technical
it
speak
to
the
attempt
by
the
government
to
increase
we
competitive
advantage
,
ramp
up
research
and
development
incentive
,
as
we
do
in
the
budget
,
and
ensure
that
we
can
mine
more
of
the
intellectual
property
within
we
research
facility
and
institution
,
and
to
encourage
the
sme
sector
to
ensure
it
can
get
on
board
as
well
in
term
of
begin
to
think
more
laterally
about
whether
it
want
to
engage
in
research
and
development
and
to
provide
incentive
to
that
end
.
I
hope
I
have
address
the
point
in
general
.
if
I
have
not
,
I
be
happy
to
come
back
to
any
point
that
be
outstanding
on
a
late
stage
.
there
be
some
loss
of
income
.
the
Senator
should
forgive
I
for
not
respond
to
the
question
.
the
number
of
application
for
patent
protection
receive
in
2010
be
792
.
there
be
a
decrease
of
18
%
from
2009
.
a
total
of
243
patent
be
grant
in
2010
,
a
decrease
of
26
%
compare
to
2009
.
a
loss
of
revenue
arise
in
term
of
fee
for
translation
in
the
context
of
this
country
become
a
party
to
the
agreement
.
as
part
of
the
validation
process
a
applicant
must
lodge
a
translation
for
a
patent
grant
in
French
or
German
in
the
office
within
six
month
of
grant
of
patent
together
with
a
fee
of
€
35
.
in
2010
that
come
to
€
33,215
.
it
be
worth
note
that
the
figure
have
be
steadily
decrease
.
in
2006
it
stand
at
€
62000
.
the
crucial
point
be
not
necessarily
the
loss
of
revenue
to

I
thank
Senator
for
they
contribution
to
the
debate
and
broad
support
for
the
Bill
.
the
rationale
behind
it
be
very
sound
.
it
can
end
the
current
financial
burden
on
industry
by
provide
the
full
translation
of
the
European
patent
to
ensure
full
protection
of
the
patent
across
Europe
.
there
be
a
strong
appreciation
in
this
House
that
it
be
vital
that
Irish
business
no
long
be
hamper
by
a
system
that
be
inefficient
and
costly
.
I
wish
to
address
two
issue
raise
on
second
stage
last
week
,
one
of
which
be
raise
by
Senator
Mooney
.
concern
be
express
that
Irish
enterprise
be
lose
under
the
current
European
patent
system
as
a
result
of
the
expense
of
register
a
patent
throughout
Europe
.
I
would
characterise
it
more
as
a
loss
of
opportunity
for
Irish
firm
to
enter
new
market
in
Europe
when
patent
holder
take
a
selective
cost
-
effective
approach
to
invalidate
state
for
patent
protection
.
implementation
of
the
London
agreement
will
go
a
considerable
way
to
reduce
this
barrier
,
offer
Irish
enterprise
easy
access
to
this
market
as
a
result
of
be
able
to
protect
they
intellectual
property
at
a
more
reasonable
cost
.
I
will
address
a
issue
raise
on
second
stage
by
Senator
Crown
last
week
,
namely
,
a
patent
cliff
for
pharmaceutical
product
.
this
be
a
issue
that
be
well
recognise
by
the
pharmaceutical
sector
base
in
Ireland
and
we
enterprise
agency
.
the
strategy
for
deal
with
this
include
a
great
emphasis
on
niche
market
and
market
in
rapidly
develop
economy
and
a
modest
but
grow
generic
medicine
industry
in
Ireland
.
it
be
encouraging
that
the
most
recent
trade
figure
continue
to
show
strong
export
growth
in
medical
and
pharmaceutical
product
and
the
good
way
to
sustain
this
growth
be
to
maintain
the
current
policy
of
the
IDA
of
target
the
attraction
of
research
and
development
activity
in
the
pharmaceutical
sector
in
Ireland
.
although
the
Bill
introduce
modest
change
,
I
ask
Senator
to
take
a
note
of
two
important
point
.
first
,
as
the
London
agreement
come
into
force
throughout
Europe
,
Irish
-
base
enterprise
and
research
be
save
increase
amount
in
translation
cost
.
by
ratify
the
London
agreement
Ireland
will
become
a
more
attractive
location
to
validate
European
patent
,
result
in
great
innovation
activity
here
and
income
increase
for
the
Irish
Patent
Office
.
second
,
this
be
one
element
in
the
continue
process
of
reform
the
patent
and
overall
intellectual
property
regime
in
Ireland
to
ensure
it
remain
fit
for
purpose
and
enhance
we
attractiveness
as
a
international
ip
hub
.
the
Bill
will
not
come
into
effect
until
the
corresponding
patent
rule
be
amend
.
they
give
the
detailed
administrative
guidance
on
the
application
of
the
Patent
Act
1992
.
amendment
to
this
rule
will
be
bring
in
to
effect
by
means
of
a
statutory
instrument
sign
by
the
minister
.
with
regard
to
the
EU
patent
,
to
date
,
25
of
the
27
member
state
of
the
EU
have
indicate
a
willingness
to
partake
in
such
a
system
.
the
commission
envisage
that
the
first
unitary
patent
protection
will
be
issue
in
2014
.
I
hope
that
adequately
address
the
question
.
I
be
grateful
to
the
Senator
for
they
comment
and
contribution
on
this
issue
,
and
also
for
they
insight
.
some
very
incisive
comment
be
make
on
second
Stage
,
to
which
we
must
have
regard
as
we
proceed
with
the
legislation
.
I
express
my
appreciation
to
the
House
in
that
regard
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
the
opportunity
to
discuss
this
issue
and
express
he
concern
about
the
alignment
of
local
community
and
local
government
.
the
programme
for
government
have
commit
to
a
review
of
local
governance
structure
with
a
view
to
improve
delivery
of
service
to
the
citizen
.
as
part
of
give
effect
to
this
commitment
,
the
Minister
for
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
,
deputy
Hogan
,
establish
a
high
-
level
steering
group
last
September
to
discuss
enhance
the
alignment
between
local
government
and
the
local
development
sector
.
the
minister
set
out
on
a
course
of
alignment
rather
than
integration
—
I
assure
the
Senator
in
that
regard
—
and
I
know
he
be
still
think
in
that
term
.
the
steering
group
be
give
a
broad
remit
to
review
the
role
of
local
development
and
local
government
,
to
identify
the
scope
for
great
synergy
between
the
sector
,
and
to
provide
recommendation
on
how
we
might
deliver
simplify
,
cost
-
effective
and
efficient
service
for
the
citizen
in
a
way
that
allow
for
local
oversight
and
democratic
accountability
.
the
group
have
consult
extensively
with
stakeholder
in
order
to
receive
input
from
all
that
involved
in
the
area
of
local
and
community
development
,
and
I
understand
this
input
have
prove
valuable
to
the
group
in
its
work
towards
develop
recommendation
for
great
alignment
of
the
sector
.
the
steering
group
present
a
interim
report
to
the
minister
in
early
December
,
outline
some
preliminary
conclusion
vis-à
-
vo
the
exist
arrangement
and
the
respective
role
of
local
authority
and
the
local
and
community
development
sector
in
the
provision
of
local
and
community
development
service
.
the
group
reaffirm
the
need
for
a
more
coherent
approach
to
local
service
provision
.
it
see
the
need
for
a
more
central
role
for
local
government
in
planning
,
decision
-
making
and
oversight
of
local
development
programme
.
the
group
also
acknowledge
the
importance
of
retain
the
developmental
bottom
-
up
approach
to
local
development
,
with
its
focus
on
target
that
most
in
need
and
facilitate
meaningful
community
participation
.
it
recommend
that
this
valuable
approach
be
embed
as
a
integral
part
of
the
planning
and
decision
-
making
process
for
the
delivery
of
service
at
local
level
.
in
the
past
two
decade
,
certain
gap
in
service
provision
at
local
level
have
be
fill
successfully
by
local
development
company
.
they
now
have
a
prove
track
record
when
it
come
to
support
local
community
.
the
minister
be
aware
that
the
local
development
company
have
unique
strength
,
skill
and
experience
,
and
he
will
expect
they
to
continue
to
play
a
pivotal
role
in
the
implementation
of
local
development
action
.
the
minister
have
a
equally
strong
belief
in
the
central
role
that
local
government
have
in
the
life
of
we
community
.
local
government
should
exercise
local
leadership
.
as
part
of
that
,
local
authority
give
coherent
and
strategic
direction
to
the
delivery
of
community
and
local
development
intervention
at
a
local
level
.
a
key
focus
,
therefore
,
of
this
alignment
process
be
to
harness
the
strength
and
experience
of
the
local
government
and
local
development
sector
.
this
be
a
great
opportunity
to
bring
great
coherence
to
the
provision
of
service
and
maximise
the
benefit
for
community
,
especially
when
resource
be
scarce
and
service
be
very
much
need
.
the
minister
be
confident
that
local
government
and
local
development
can
work
in
partnership
to
deliver
efficient
,
sustainable
,
join
-
up
and
easy
to
access
service
for
people
locally
.
the
Senator
raise
the
issue
of
the
European
Court
of
Auditor
report
on
the
implementation
of
the
leader
approach
.
I
recognise
that
it
contain
a
number
of
recommendation
to
ensure
the
value
of
the
leader
approach
be
retain
.
there
be
a
strong
record
in
Ireland
with
regard
to
the
leader
programme
and
we
will
not
introduce
measure
that
will
damage
we
standing
in
this
regard
.
I
be
confident
that
any
recommendation
the
steering
group
propose
will
fully
respect
the
finding
in
the
European
Court
of
Auditor
's
report
and
will
not
breach
the
leader
requirement
with
regard
to
the
composition
and
decision
-
make
process
of
local
action
group
as
define
in
the
EU
regulation
.
I
understand
the
steering
group
will
present
its
final
report
to
the
minister
in
the
come
week
.
its
recommendation
will
inform
we
plan
with
regard
to
the
overall
local
government
reform
agenda
and
will
be
subject
to
careful
consideration
in
that
context
.
I
again
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
matter
.
I
thank
Senator
Power
and
Zappone
for
raise
this
matter
.
as
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Alan
Shatter
,
have
say
,
he
extend
he
apology
that
he
be
unable
to
be
present
,
therefore
I
speak
on
he
behalf
.
before
comment
on
Sweden
's
legislative
model
which
criminalise
the
purchase
of
sexual
service
I
wish
to
outline
the
legislative
measure
in
place
to
tackle
the
phenomenon
of
human
trafficking
and
organised
prostitution
.
Ireland
have
strong
legislation
to
combat
the
scourge
of
human
trafficking
for
sexual
exploitation
.
the
criminal
Law
(
human
trafficking
)
act
2008
give
effect
to
Ireland
's
obligation
in
various
international
instrument
to
criminalise
human
trafficking
.
the
trafficking
of
person
for
sexual
exploitation
,
include
prostitution
,
be
a
criminal
offence
and
that
convict
of
such
trafficking
be
liable
to
life
imprisonment
.
in
addition
,
it
be
a
offence
under
the
legislation
for
any
person
to
knowingly
solicit
or
importune
a
traffick
person
,
in
any
place
,
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution
.
in
the
case
of
prostitution
legislation
,
there
be
a
number
of
offence
directly
aim
at
protect
prostitute
from
exploitation
.
under
the
criminal
law
(
sexual
offence
)
act
1993
,
it
be
a
offence
to
organise
prostitution
,
coerce
or
compel
a
person
to
be
a
prostitute
,
knowingly
live
off
the
earnings
of
a
prostitute
,
or
keep
or
manage
a
brothel
.
in
addition
,
the
solicitation
offence
in
the
legislation
be
target
at
buyer
,
seller
and
third
party
,
such
as
pimp
.
buyer
as
well
as
seller
be
liable
to
prosecution
and
the
same
penalty
apply
.
the
1993
act
,
as
amend
,
provide
that
a
person
who
solicit
or
importune
a
child
—
whether
or
not
for
the
purpose
of
prostitution
—
to
commit
a
act
which
would
constitute
carnal
knowledge
or
sexual
assault
be
guilty
of
a
offence
.
moreover
,
in
addition
to
be
charge
with
such
solicitation
,
a
person
who
engage
in
a
sexual
act
with
the
child
could
be
charge
with
serious
offence
under
sexual
offence
legislation
.
in
this
circumstance
,
consent
to
the
sexual
act
be
not
a
defence
.
strong
as
the
law
be
,
there
be
always
room
for
improvement
and
the
law
on
prostitution
be
be
review
with
a
view
to
enhance
the
protection
of
vulnerable
person
.
I
should
add
that
the
law
be
be
enforce
.
a
Garda
Síochána
continually
target
the
individual
and
criminal
group
involve
in
prostitution
and
related
activity
.
a
number
of
individual
and
criminal
group
have
be
identify
,
arrest
,
prosecute
and
convict
.
the
Garda
carry
out
target
operation
to
address
crime
in
regard
to
prostitution
,
and
this
often
encompass
situation
where
it
be
suspect
that
woman
and
girl
have
be
traffick
for
the
purpose
of
sexual
exploitation
.
this
include
monitoring
of
website
associate
with
the
advertising
of
prostitution
,
target
the
activity
of
criminal
group
involve
in
organised
prostitution
,
brothel
keeping
and
money
laundering
offence
.
give
the
involvement
of
organised
crime
gang
,
such
operation
may
be
support
by
specialist
assistance
provide
by
unit
such
as
the
criminal
Asset
Bureau
the
Garda
National
Immigration
Bureau
and
the
Garda
Bureau
of
Fraud
investigation
.
as
part
of
the
review
I
mention
early
,
the
minister
announce
in
October
that
he
would
be
arrange
a
consultation
process
on
the
future
direction
of
prostitution
legislation
.
a
detailed
discussion
document
to
facilitate
the
consultation
process
be
be
prepare
.
it
will
be
appreciate
that
the
discussion
document
,
if
it
be
to
fully
inform
the
public
,
need
to
be
prepare
carefully
.
it
be
expect
that
the
document
will
be
ready
in
the
come
week
.
the
Senator
have
ask
for
clarification
as
to
whether
it
be
the
government
's
intention
to
change
Ireland
's
law
on
prostitution
to
bring
they
into
line
with
the
Swedish
approach
,
as
advocate
by
the
turn
off
the
Red
Light
coalition
.
the
government
have
not
make
any
decision
in
this
matter
.
when
the
review
,
include
public
consultation
,
be
conclude
,
the
minister
will
bring
any
legislative
proposal
to
government
in
the
normal
way
.
while
no
decision
have
be
take
with
regard
to
legislative
proposal
,
it
be
important
to
point
out
,
as
be
already
indicate
in
the
Seanad
debate
last
October
,
that
any
proposal
to
criminalise
the
purchase
of
sex
within
we
legal
framework
raise
complex
issue
.
a
provision
in
the
substantially
different
constitutional
framework
of
one
jurisdiction
cannot
be
simply
transpose
into
another
jurisdiction
's
constitutional
and
legal
framework
.
the
minister
do
not
wish
to
appear
to
be
dismiss
the
Swedish
model
out
of
hand
.
all
option
will
be
consider
but
it
be
important
to
mention
that
there
be
issue
which
require
in
-
depth
examination
.
the
Swedish
offence
of
purchase
sexual
service
would
appear
to
be
a
strict
liability
offence
.
there
be
difficulty
in
this
jurisdiction
in
establish
offence
of
strict
and
absolute
liability
arise
from
the
Supreme
Court
decision
in
the
CC
case
.
if
the
Swedish
approach
be
adopt
here
,
one
party
only
to
a
two
-
way
transaction
between
consent
adult
would
be
guilty
of
a
offence
.
the
buyer
only
would
be
culpable
and
subject
to
penalty
,
with
all
that
entail
.
the
buyer
would
have
no
defence
in
law
and
the
seller
would
not
commit
any
offence
in
respect
of
the
receipt
of
a
consideration
for
sexual
service
.
criminalise
one
party
only
in
this
manner
,
be
it
not
clearly
justifiable
on
objective
grounds
,
could
be
open
to
constitutional
challenge
.
there
would
obviously
be
concern
too
,
at
criminalise
the
sale
of
sex
by
exploit
person
.
in
addition
to
legal
concern
,
there
be
different
and
genuinely
hold
view
on
this
matter
.
the
minister
do
not
believe
that
the
introduction
of
a
Swedish
style
ban
could
be
advance
here
without
a
consider
public
debate
.
this
be
a
issue
which
affect
individual
and
community
.
it
be
also
a
societal
issue
.
Public
debate
should
be
open
to
the
wide
possible
audience
and
the
minister
want
to
ensure
that
everyone
who
wish
to
make
a
contribution
to
this
important
debate
be
give
the
opportunity
to
do
so
.
that
be
the
reason
the
minister
have
decide
on
a
consultation
process
before
chart
the
way
ahead
.
I
would
like
to
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
issue
today
.
the
minister
would
like
to
reiterate
that
everything
that
can
reasonably
be
do
to
combat
prostitution
will
be
do
,
and
he
look
forward
to
the
outcome
of
the
consultation
process
,
which
be
expect
to
get
under
way
shortly
.
we
must
have
due
regard
to
what
Senator
Power
and
Zappone
be
say
.
if
such
a
statement
be
make
in
October
2011
and
if
they
justifiably
feel
that
no
progress
have
be
make
on
that
issue
,
then
I
would
like
to
assure
they
that
I
will
speak
to
the
minister
and
that
we
need
to
make
haste
on
it
.
I
genuinely
have
regard
to
the
statement
that
have
be
make
.
as
this
be
a
cross
-
bench
issue
and
affect
all
of
we
as
a
society
,
I
hope
that
the
Senator
's
view
would
have
a
major
influence
in
the
process
and
I
hope
that
the
Department
would
take
seriously
the
view
that
have
be
express
here
today
.
I
will
talk
directly
with
the
minister
and
try
to
move
the
process
along
.
I
be
glad
that
both
Senator
have
raise
the
issue
.
the
last
point
make
be
about
the
over
-
dependence
on
the
construction
industry
.
that
be
part
of
the
structural
difficulty
which
exist
in
many
of
the
region
outside
of
the
large
urban
conurbation
,
where
the
labour
force
move
into
the
construction
industry
.
when
the
construction
industry
fall
apart
,
all
of
a
sudden
there
be
massive
rate
of
unemployment
.
the
south
east
,
in
particular
,
have
see
its
unemployment
rate
jump
from
4.9
%
in
2007
—
which
be
marginally
above
the
countrywide
average
of
4.6
%
—
to
18.2
%
,
compare
with
a
national
average
of
14.3
%
.
there
be
a
clear
acknowledgement
of
the
difficulty
face
the
south
east
.
I
will
be
frank
and
say
that
neither
of
the
two
Senator
have
proffer
any
solution
.
we
must
acknowledge
that
state
agency
such
as
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
,
as
well
as
local
authority
,
academic
institution
and
enterprise
board
,
will
have
to
be
part
of
a
plan
to
stem
that
tide
of
unemployment
and
reverse
the
trend
.
the
south
-
east
action
plan
contain
specific
action
to
address
the
unemployment
problem
affect
the
south
east
.
the
plan
,
which
be
geographically
orient
towards
that
area
,
be
launch
more
than
two
month
ago
,
on
2
December
.
its
intention
be
to
provide
for
regular
meeting
with
a
forum
represent
the
agency
and
local
stakeholder
to
progress
its
implementation
.
the
structural
challenge
face
by
the
south
east
region
have
build
up
over
many
year
and
will
not
be
reverse
by
a
simple
set
of
action
.
what
be
require
be
to
build
a
strong
local
enterprise
base
in
the
region
as
a
whole
.
the
report
identify
many
action
that
can
help
deliver
on
that
ambition
,
but
it
will
only
achieve
so
much
.
the
Senator
will
acknowledge
that
we
cannot
reverse
the
unemployment
trend
overnight
.
there
will
need
to
be
structural
change
and
investment
in
key
area
in
order
to
stem
that
tide
.
there
be
challenge
for
all
agency
to
build
up
the
region
's
competitive
advantage
and
then
promote
it
in
a
co-ordinate
manner
.
one
of
the
key
issue
that
no
single
agency
or
Department
can
hope
to
address
be
the
issue
of
the
overall
coherence
of
the
region
's
value
proposition
to
investor
from
home
or
abroad
.
what
have
arise
again
and
again
in
consultation
with
all
the
relevant
stakeholder
and
agency
in
the
region
be
the
need
for
great
co-ordination
of
effort
from
all
that
with
a
interest
in
improve
the
enterprise
potential
of
the
region
.
this
be
bring
to
the
fore
when
the
agency
,
local
authority
,
ceb
,
educational
institution
and
other
local
representative
group
meet
with
the
minister
on
24
November
last
.
that
meeting
be
the
first
time
a
group
of
that
nature
have
meet
with
a
focus
solely
on
what
could
be
do
to
improve
the
region
's
fortune
,
which
be
worth
note
.
we
must
also
bear
in
mind
that
the
figure
quote
by
Senator
Cullinane
be
from
a
time
when
a
different
political
entity
be
at
the
helm
.
in
all
fairness
,
what
this
government
have
do
be
to
seek
to
meet
the
challenge
face
by
the
south
east
head
-
on
,
in
partnership
with
the
State
agency
.
I
understand
the
Senator
will
want
to
score
a
point
off
I
,
as
Minister
of
State
,
but
he
should
recognise
that
people
across
party
political
boundary
want
to
work
together
to
stem
the
tide
of
unemployment
.
the
minister
intend
in
the
come
year
to
facilitate
a
series
of
further
meeting
of
that
same
group
as
a
means
of
monitor
the
implementation
of
the
proposal
in
this
report
and
also
to
forge
great
co-operation
and
collaboration
between
the
various
stakeholder
across
the
region
.
I
hope
Senator
Cullinane
will
get
on
board
with
that
process
.
it
be
not
just
a
matter
of
identify
a
set
of
metric
from
2007
to
2010
.
we
need
to
consider
the
problem
from
a
qualitative
point
of
view
.
we
cannot
just
extrapolate
from
the
rate
of
investment
by
IDA
Ireland
or
Enterprise
Ireland
and
say
that
in
monetary
term
,
the
south
east
have
not
benefit
,
because
other
region
have
the
same
claim
,
in
real
term
.
we
can
say
that
the
large
urban
area
such
as
Cork
,
Dublin
and
Galway
have
a
disproportionately
high
rate
of
inward
investment
in
the
form
of
IDA
project
,
but
we
also
need
to
consider
human
capital
,
soft
skill
and
the
relationship
among
stakeholder
.
there
be
now
a
model
,
sponsor
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
to
deal
with
this
.
it
be
not
that
I
be
be
defensive
.
if
we
be
debate
a
issue
,
we
need
to
set
out
the
parameter
for
that
debate
.
we
must
have
due
regard
to
the
fact
that
all
of
the
stakeholder
want
to
drive
this
on
.
in
fairness
to
all
political
entity
,
they
also
want
to
drive
this
on
.
if
it
need
to
be
critique
,
we
be
open
to
that
.
however
,
it
be
not
just
a
question
of
investment
by
the
IDA
,
although
that
be
one
aspect
of
it
.
it
be
a
question
,
also
,
of
ensure
that
we
can
deliver
on
education
.
Senator
Cullinane
will
be
aware
of
my
commitment
to
the
Telecommunications
Software
&
System
Group
,
TSSG
,
which
be
,
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
,
a
beacon
for
the
region
.
we
need
to
mine
more
of
that
intellectual
development
and
human
capital
.
inch
by
inch
,
that
be
what
will
restore
the
region
so
that
we
have
a
level
playing
field
.
I
have
listen
to
the
point
that
be
make
.
we
be
not
go
to
be
complacent
about
this
.
we
have
a
job
to
do
.
yes
.
I
thank
the
Senator
for
raise
this
matter
on
the
adjournment
.
it
be
recognise
that
international
rank
system
be
reference
by
international
investor
,
employer
and
student
and
consequently
they
can
not
be
ignore
.
however
,
it
should
also
be
note
that
this
system
be
not
infallible
and
it
be
widely
agree
that
they
should
be
interpret
with
caution
.
we
can
draw
encouragement
from
the
overall
performance
of
the
Irish
system
on
the
late
Times
High
Education
system
performance
table
which
place
Ireland
firmly
in
the
world
's
top
20
.
we
be
rank
17th
overall
and
sixth
in
the
world
relative
to
we
gdp
.
the
focus
in
Ireland
be
on
sustain
and
advance
performance
throughout
the
system
as
a
whole
rather
than
invest
in
elite
institution
.
early
last
year
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
set
out
he
priority
for
the
development
of
the
high
education
system
during
the
next
20
year
and
endorse
a
range
of
action
to
develop
the
quality
of
teaching
and
learning
and
to
ensure
the
relevance
of
programme
and
curriculum
design
throughout
the
system
.
this
action
be
focus
on
improve
the
overall
student
experience
and
improve
the
quality
and
employability
of
Irish
graduate
.
on
30
January
the
President
of
American
Chamber
of
Commerce
Ireland
join
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
and
the
Chair
of
the
High
Education
Authority
,
the
expert
group
on
future
skill
need
and
ICT
Ireland
to
launch
a
new
action
plan
to
address
the
high
-
level
ICT
skill
need
of
enterprise
in
Ireland
.
the
action
plan
be
available
on
the
Department
website
.
it
be
develop
in
response
to
a
clear
message
from
industry
that
there
be
ICT
skill
shortage
and
,
more
important
,
that
job
can
be
create
if
we
have
the
graduate
to
fill
they
.
in
a
highly
mobile
and
global
sector
such
as
ICT
,
inward
migration
by
skilled
professional
will
always
play
a
key
role
in
meet
the
skill
need
of
company
.
however
,
boost
the
domestic
supply
of
graduate
for
21st
century
job
be
a
key
objective
for
the
education
system
.
the
action
plan
,
publish
last
week
,
have
be
develop
during
the
past
12
month
with
close
collaboration
between
official
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
,
the
expert
group
on
future
skill
need
,
the
HEA
,
ICT
Ireland
and
the
American
Chamber
of
Commerce
Ireland
.
it
set
out
short
-
,
medium
-
and
long
-
term
action
with
specific
time
-
bind
target
to
meet
the
skill
gap
in
the
short
term
while
,
in
tandem
,
build
up
the
long
term
supply
of
high
quality
graduate
.
this
include
the
establishment
of
a
ambitious
target
of
double
the
annual
output
of
ICT
graduate
from
1000
this
year
to
2000
by
2018
.
the
skill
shortage
experience
have
not
arise
overnight
and
be
not
unique
to
Ireland
.
there
be
no
quick
-
fix
solution
that
will
meet
all
of
the
shortage
overnight
.
however
,
the
plan
include
step
that
will
be
take
to
increase
the
supply
of
graduate
within
the
next
12
month
.
the
key
action
in
this
regard
be
the
immediate
roll
-
out
of
750
place
on
17
new
fully
fund
graduate
skill
conversion
programme
throughout
the
country
.
this
programme
have
be
develop
by
public
and
private
high
education
provider
in
collaboration
with
industry
partner
.
participant
on
the
programme
will
obtain
a
post
graduate
qualification
in
core
computing
skill
at
honour
degree
level
and
will
be
offer
a
work
placement
with
one
of
the
company
involve
in
the
design
of
the
programme
.
detail
of
all
of
the
new
conversion
programme
be
available
on
the
BlueBrick
.ie
web
portal
.
the
majority
of
the
programme
will
be
under
way
by
March
and
application
can
be
submit
immediately
through
the
website
.
I
appreciate
the
point
make
by
Senator
Walsh
but
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
sense
of
complacency
.
the
opposite
be
the
case
;
there
be
a
great
sense
of
urgency
and
there
be
sleepless
night
in
respect
of
how
we
should
address
this
problem
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
one
can
extrapolate
from
the
Times
High
Education
system
performance
table
.
one
can
delve
into
the
criterion
they
apply
.
Criteria
for
measure
ranking
differ
from
one
set
of
ranking
to
another
.
there
be
no
sense
of
complacency
.
the
datum
be
important
and
widely
report
and
when
the
report
come
in
we
take
they
seriously
.
in
fairness
we
work
and
that
of
previous
government
with
American
Chamber
of
Commerce
Ireland
stand
up
.
when
they
send
signal
across
the
table
we
sit
up
and
listen
,
as
have
previous
government
;
if
message
come
from
they
we
take
note
.
it
be
important
to
realise
that
there
be
many
Irish
people
work
in
US
company
who
have
have
long
and
distinguished
career
in
that
company
.
they
be
very
attuned
to
they
need
as
well
and
they
have
the
ear
of
government
.
in
fairness
,
traditionally
Fianna
Fáil
government
have
set
out
this
approach
and
have
be
a
part
of
the
process
for
the
science
,
technology
and
innovation
programme
.
this
be
a
apolitical
area
.
with
regard
to
the
point
make
by
Senator
Walsh
,
there
be
a
strong
sense
of
the
urgency
in
respect
of
deal
with
the
skill
shortage
.
however
,
the
Senator
will
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
over
-
reliance
on
construction
and
many
child
go
into
construction
study
from
second
level
rather
than
software
engineering
or
other
engineering
programme
and
one
cannot
turn
around
that
ship
overnight
.
it
be
healthy
for
the
system
to
have
world
class
researcher
come
from
abroad
.
it
cause
we
to
up
we
game
.
I
appreciate
the
point
make
.
there
be
no
sense
of
complacency
;
we
be
move
rapidly
to
address
the
deficit
.

this
House
be
aware
that
,
in
the
context
of
budget
2012
and
the
need
for
the
State
to
achieve
economic
independence
in
the
come
year
,
difficult
choice
have
to
be
make
to
achieve
savings
.
to
this
end
,
in
2011
all
Department
carry
out
a
comprehensive
review
of
expenditure
on
all
budget
and
programme
,
and
proposal
to
achieve
savings
be
put
to
government
.
as
one
of
the
large
spending
Department
,
this
be
also
the
case
in
regard
to
expenditure
on
education
.
in
make
this
difficult
decision
,
priority
be
give
to
protect
resource
for
front
line
service
as
far
as
possible
in
the
come
year
.
for
example
,
the
general
average
of
28:1
for
the
allocation
of
classroom
teacher
at
primary
level
have
be
maintain
and
the
overall
number
of
special
need
assistant
and
resource
teacher
will
be
maintain
at
current
level
.
however
,
savings
have
to
be
make
,
even
against
a
background
of
the
expect
increase
in
the
school
go
population
in
the
come
year
.
one
such
decision
be
the
abolition
,
for
new
student
,
of
the
grant
pay
for
student
teacher
's
three
week
placement
in
Gaeltacht
summer
college
.
currently
,
satisfactory
attendance
at
a
Irish
language
course
in
the
Gaeltacht
be
a
compulsory
element
of
the
primary
initial
teacher
education
,
ite
,
course
.
in
respect
of
student
in
the
State
-
fund
college
of
education
,
the
Department
pay
a
grant
of
€637
per
student
directly
to
the
Gaeltacht
summer
college
per
three
week
course
.
this
be
a
annual
cost
of
over
€
700000
,
represent
money
that
would
have
to
be
find
elsewhere
within
the
education
budget
.
the
removal
of
the
grant
mean
student
will
be
liable
for
the
cost
.
we
would
all
prefer
if
this
choice
do
not
have
to
be
make
.
it
have
to
be
view
in
the
context
of
the
prevail
requirement
to
reduce
cost
and
achieve
efficiency
where
possible
.
this
move
bring
the
primary
ite
course
more
into
line
with
a
number
of
other
type
of
degree
programme
,
such
as
language
degree
,
where
student
be
require
to
bear
the
cost
of
additional
special
requirement
themselves
.
for
example
,
there
be
modern
language
degree
where
a
stay
in
a
foreign
country
might
be
require
.
the
Senator
might
wish
to
note
ITE
course
be
be
reconfigure
in
line
with
the
recommendation
of
the
Department
's
literacy
and
numeracy
strategy
and
the
Teaching
Council
's
policy
on
teacher
education
,
and
the
need
to
ensure
that
all
primary
teacher
be
competent
and
confident
in
they
use
of
the
Irish
language
,
especially
give
its
importance
in
the
primary
school
curriculum
.
to
this
end
,
we
be
look
at
raise
the
bar
in
regard
to
the
Irish
leave
certificate
entry
requirement
for
teacher
education
,
but
the
quality
of
engagement
during
the
Gaeltacht
placement
also
need
to
be
of
a
high
standard
and
be
more
focus
on
the
outcome
require
for
we
teacher
.
the
Senator
's
point
be
fair
.
I
wish
I
be
in
a
position
to
be
able
to
tell
he
we
can
reverse
this
decision
but
we
cannot
.
some
80
%
of
the
budget
relate
to
pay
.
there
be
commitment
under
Croke
Park
.
I
have
to
be
honest
and
straight
with
the
Senator
.
the
decision
have
be
make
with
regard
to
this
budget
line
.
however
,
the
it
course
will
be
reconfigure
in
line
with
the
recommendation
.
it
be
the
case
that
the
money
be
not
there
.
I
do
not
want
to
plámás
the
Senator
or
give
he
the
usual
political
platitude
but
I
must
be
straight
with
he
and
tell
he
that
the
money
be
not
there
.

amendment

I
appreciate
they
concern
about
the
intention
to
have
the
Bill
apply
retrospectively
from
5
December
2011
,
the
transposition
date
of
the
directive
.
on
second
stage
early
this
week
the
minister
indicate
that
he
be
in
receipt
of
legal
advice
from
the
Office
of
the
Attorney
General
to
the
effect
that
the
legislation
should
,
on
enactment
,
have
retrospective
effect
from
5
December
2011
,
with
the
notable
exception
of
the
offence
create
provision
in
section
13
and
15
in
part
4
of
the
Bill
.
this
provision
will
come
into
effect
on
enactment
of
the
legislation
.
my
advice
be
base
on
the
fact
that
implementation
of
the
directive
provision
be
necessitate
to
meet
the
obligation
arise
from
membership
of
the
European
Union
and
that
,
therefore
,
they
enjoy
protection
under
the
constitution
.
one
must
have
regard
to
the
point
that
be
make
by
that
such
as
Senator
Quinn
and
Mary
Ann
O'Brien
in
term
of
they
experience
as
business
people
and
give
Senator
Quinn
's
long
-
standing
membership
of
this
House
as
a
legislator
.
one
have
to
have
due
regard
and
respect
for
that
and
for
everything
he
say
.
if
we
strip
out
all
of
the
rhetoric
,
the
verbose
language
and
the
accusation
,
which
I
appreciate
give
such
language
occur
in
the
normal
course
of
political
dialogue
,
the
key
point
be
that
this
be
about
the
implementation
of
a
directive
.
I
will
not
be
drag
into
a
debate
on
the
last
government
's
performance
and
its
relationship
with
the
European
Union
—
—
—
—
or
the
nature
of
we
own
relationship
with
the
European
Union
.
I
happen
to
believe
we
be
a
member
of
the
European
Union
—
that
be
factual
.
as
such
,
we
have
sign
up
to
a
process
of
consultation
through
co-decision
procedure
and
interaction
with
the
Council
of
Minister
and
the
commission
.
when
the
commission
make
a
legislative
proposal
,
if
there
be
a
co-decision
procedure
to
be
adhere
to
,
then
we
,
as
a
member
of
the
EU
,
be
party
to
that
consultation
process
.
when
a
agreement
be
reach
,
primarily
on
the
basis
of
consensus
,
we
then
transpose
the
directive
.
in
this
case
,
the
directive
date
back
to
2008
;
therefore
,
we
have
to
transpose
it
.
if
we
all
agree
to
the
fact
we
be
a
member
of
the
EU
,
then
we
subscribe
to
that
found
principle
and
the
legislative
action
arise
thereof
and
to
which
we
be
party
.
to
take
the
point
make
by
Mr.
Jim
Power
,
he
be
extrapolate
from
a
UK
figure
.
while
the
Senator
state
he
have
no
grá
for
Mr.
Power
,
I
happen
to
think
Mr.
Power
be
provocative
and
one
who
have
provoke
debate
in
a
very
positive
sense
in
this
country
around
issue
such
as
agriculture
,
for
example
—
—
—
—
and
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
employment
.
he
have
provoke
good
debate
,
which
be
what
we
need
in
this
country
.
however
,
there
be
no
evidence
to
date
that
in
the
UK
job
loss
have
occur
as
a
result
of
the
same
directive
that
must
be
transpose
into
UK
law
.
I
be
not
aware
of
any
evidence
on
the
record
of
this
House
or
the
Dáil
in
respect
of
utterance
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
in
regard
to
job
loss
.
with
the
indulgence
of
the
House
,
I
will
quote
again
from
he
speech
:
the
final
derogation
available
under
article
5.4
of
the
directive
recognise
the
voluntarist
nature
of
industrial
relation
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
and
in
Ireland
and
be
design
to
meet
the
need
and
flexibility
require
in
the
labour
market
to
accommodate
the
system
in
place
in
both
country
.
the
derogation
include
the
possibility
for
a
"
qualifying
period
"
before
the
principle
of
equal
treatment
would
apply
to
temporary
agency
worker
.
to
be
fair
to
the
minister
,
what
we
be
try
to
do
here
be
to
protect
the
rights
of
worker
,
to
comply
with
the
EU
directive
and
to
do
so
in
a
way
that
be
balance
.
if
there
be
a
contention
that
job
loss
will
occur
directly
in
one
specific
company
or
entity
as
a
result
of
this
,
I
respectfully
suggest
I
have
my
doubt
.
the
evidence
in
term
of
inward
investment
into
Ireland
by
global
company
,
which
have
public
affair
department
and
be
au
None
through
that
department
with
trend
in
EU
legislation
and
transposition
of
EU
directive
,
be
that
they
be
aware
this
legislation
be
on
the
card
and
would
have
regard
to
that
fact
when
they
be
make
they
investment
decision
in
Ireland
.
we
have
have
some
notable
investment
decision
and
notable
company
set
up
here
,
some
of
whose
operation
would
be
within
the
sphere
of
employ
temporary
agency
worker
or
contract
worker
.
I
have
not
see
any
evidence
of
job
loss
in
the
UK
and
do
not
know
of
any
public
utterance
by
the
minister
to
this
or
the
other
House
in
respect
of
prospective
job
loss
.
if
somebody
have
do
a
study
or
have
extrapolate
from
UK
figure
,
it
should
be
put
on
the
record
or
submit
to
the
Oireachtas
Library
and
Research
Service
.
the
propose
amendment
which
have
be
rule
out
of
order
seek
to
move
beyond
the
scope
of
the
requirement
contain
in
the
directive
.
the
directive
seek
only
to
set
a
floor
of
entitlement
in
respect
of
basic
working
and
employment
condition
.
article
3.2
allow
member
state
,
in
they
national
law
,
to
determine
the
definition
of
pay
,
as
well
as
other
element
.
under
article
5.4
,
member
state
be
ask
to
specify
whether
element
such
as
pension
,
sick
pay
,
etc.
,
be
include
in
basic
working
and
employment
condition
.
give
the
scope
of
the
directive
,
this
extend
only
to
basic
working
and
employment
condition
.
it
be
not
the
government
's
intention
to
move
beyond
either
the
spirit
or
intent
of
the
directive
,
particularly
at
a
time
when
we
face
such
challenge
in
the
labour
market
.
I
may
be
oblige
to
defer
to
the
official
on
Senator
Mary
Ann
O'Brien
's
point
.
perhaps
I
might
deal
with
it
late
then
.
yes
,
I
will
be
oblige
to
do
so
.
I
will
begin
with
the
last
point
.
if
the
light
be
flash
amber
or
red
in
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
and
the
company
to
which
the
Senator
refer
be
IDA
Ireland
support
or
other
State
agency
have
be
actively
involved
with
it
,
I
suggest
the
State
agency
talk
to
representative
of
the
company
.
the
Senator
should
approach
the
State
agency
to
discuss
potential
difficulty
the
company
may
have
.
Successive
government
have
always
take
a
hand
-
on
approach
and
interven
through
the
State
agency
to
try
to
assist
individual
company
.
on
Senator
Mary
Ann
O'Brien
's
early
point
,
where
there
be
no
comparable
employee
,
the
rate
pay
should
be
that
which
would
be
pay
to
a
comparable
direct
employee
.
if
such
be
to
employ
,
the
rate
would
have
regard
to
skill
,
qualification
and
length
of
service
under
section
3
and
7
(
3
)
,
which
set
the
clock
to
5
December
2011
and
allow
the
hirer
to
base
the
rate
on
the
rate
that
apply
on
that
date
.
I
hope
that
address
the
point
raise
by
the
Senator
.
I
thank
Senator
for
they
amendment
.
the
government
understand
the
various
circumstance
Senator
be
try
to
guard
against
with
the
amendment
.
amendment
no.

seek
to
amend
the
definition
of
"
comparable
employee
"
as
contain
in
section
3
.
amendment
no.
5
seek
to
avert
any
attempt
by
agency
worker
to
select
the
most
advantageous
possible
comparable
employee
in
a
scenario
where
there
may
be
more
than
one
possible
comparator
in
a
hirer
undertaking
.
amendment
no.
8
seek
the
ability
for
the
hirer
undertaking
to
designate
one
person
as
the
comparable
employee
against
which
the
agency
worker
would
be
measure
for
the
purpose
of
equal
treatment
.
in
the
context
of
ministerial
amendment
make
to
the
Bill
during
its
passage
through
the
Dáil
,
the
legislation
already
cater
for
the
circumstance
Senator
be
seek
to
address
.
in
this
connection
,
section
3
and
7
must
be
read
together
.
the
criterion
in
section
3
require
that
the
employer
of
the
agency
worker
and
employee
must
be
the
same
,
the
agency
worker
and
employee
must
work
at
the
same
place
and
the
work
undertake
must
be
the
same
or
similar
in
nature
and
be
carry
out
under
the
same
or
similar
condition
.
section
2
provide
a
further
safeguard
to
avoid
the
selection
of
the
most
advantageous
possible
comparator
,
where
it
be
a
relevant
factor
,
in
the
recruitment
of
direct
employee
,
by
provide
that
skill
,
qualification
and
length
of
service
be
reckonable
factor
that
a
hirer
can
take
into
account
.
this
provision
all
address
in
a
appropriate
manner
the
concern
of
hirer
and
allow
they
to
develop
a
robust
defence
in
term
of
the
relevance
or
otherwise
of
the
comparator
select
.
while
I
understand
the
concern
raise
on
the
issue
of
the
possible
selection
of
inappropriate
comparator
,
it
be
the
case
that
there
be
instance
,
even
in
the
civil
and
public
service
,
where
new
entrant
be
take
on
on
less
favourable
term
and
condition
than
that
that
apply
previously
.
in
this
case
,
it
be
difficult
to
see
how
a
successful
challenge
could
be
mount
by
a
agency
worker
in
favour
of
the
application
of
term
and
condition
that
apply
previously
.
for
instance
,
new
term
and
condition
now
apply
to
new
recruit
to
the
teaching
and
nursing
profession
,
which
would
,
therefore
,
be
a
logical
benchmark
for
new
agency
worker
be
take
on
.
it
be
inconceivable
that
a
claim
for
equal
treatment
would
succeed
on
the
basis
that
a
agency
worker
could
claim
that
the
previous
term
and
condition
of
direct
recruit
should
apply
to
he
or
she
.
the
Bill
provide
this
certainty
in
so
far
as
it
can
without
unduly
prejudice
the
position
of
agency
worker
.
on
the
basis
that
they
be
already
cater
for
,
a
view
support
by
the
Parliamentary
counsel
,
while
I
thank
the
Senator
,
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
with
respect
,
I
be
happy
to
take
all
view
and
then
respond
finally
to
the
amendment
,
if
that
be
okay
.
there
have
be
a
number
of
point
.
I
suppose
now
would
be
a
bad
time
to
say
I
be
a
big
fan
of
Neuhaus
Belgian
chocolate
.
I
would
say
"
fair
play
and
well
do
"
to
anybody
with
a
Irish
company
try
to
penetrate
the
Belgian
market
.
if
the
Senator
be
get
a
foothold
in
that
market
,
I
applaud
she
.
that
be
fantastic
.
in
fairness
,
one
must
applaud
the
business
model
use
by
two
of
the
Senator
present
and
the
fact
that
the
two
business
compete
at
a
world
class
level
.
I
be
acknowledge
this
without
plámás
.
I
live
in
Belgium
for
three
year
and
I
always
think
Cadbury
's
be
the
only
chocolate
product
until
I
move
to
Belgium
.
we
can
now
appreciate
where
we
be
with
the
wonderful
product
range
and
the
high
quality
of
that
product
.
collective
agreement
be
address
in
section
8
and
the
possibility
be
allow
for
in
that
section
of
conclude
local
and
enterprise
level
agreement
.
the
fundamental
point
of
the
legislation
concern
transposition
of
a
directive
and
protection
of
worker
's
rights
.
the
question
be
what
a
person
should
be
pay
now
.
there
be
no
question
of
refer
or
revert
to
old
pay
rate
.
this
do
not
arise
.
where
do
the
Bill
mention
revert
to
old
pay
rate
?
the
clock
start
on
5
December
last
.
let
we
be
straight
about
it
.
one
must
always
have
regard
to
what
be
say
in
the
Seanad
on
legislation
.
I
accept
the
point
make
about
try
to
revisit
the
issue
involve
before
report
stage
.
however
,
there
be
a
consultation
process
on
the
legislation
date
back
to
2010
;
therefore
,
it
be
not
a
case
of
the
government
try
to
ram
it
through
.
the
consultation
process
involve
the
social
partner
and
,
in
fairness
,
the
minister
take
all
view
on
board
.
however
,
we
be
work
within
the
limitation
of
the
directive
which
be
agree
at
EU
level
by
all
member
state
.
it
be
arguable
that
no
further
consultation
be
require
because
there
have
be
full
engagement
.
with
regard
to
measure
the
potential
job
loss
,
Senator
Jim
Walsh
,
with
all
due
respect
,
be
a
member
of
Fianna
Fáil
which
be
in
power
for
the
past
decade
.
to
ask
a
minister
whether
there
will
or
will
not
be
job
loss
and
quantify
the
rate
at
which
job
loss
will
occur
be
a
little
like
ask
how
long
be
a
piece
of
string
.
we
do
not
know
.
I
accept
the
point
make
by
Senator
Mary
Ann
O'Brien
about
the
derogation
period
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
it
have
only
be
in
place
for
the
last
three
month
,
but
as
of
today
there
be
no
evidence
of
job
loss
.
there
might
be
some
,
but
that
be
not
base
on
information
to
I
from
the
State
agency
or
stakeholder
such
as
IBEC
and
other
.
one
cannot
measure
exactly
whether
there
will
be
job
loss
or
whether
there
will
be
no
change
to
employment
structure
as
a
consequence
of
this
legislation
.
bear
in
mind
that
its
purpose
be
implementation
of
the
directive
and
that
we
have
obligation
in
term
of
adherence
to
EU
law
.
with
regard
to
amendment
Nosemcue
6
and
7
,
the
requirement
in
the
directive
be
that
agency
worker
enjoy
at
least
the
same
basic
and
working
condition
that
they
would
enjoy
if
they
have
be
directly
recruit
by
the
hirer
to
do
the
same
job
.
section
7
aim
to
remain
faithful
,
as
we
be
bind
to
be
,
to
the
wording
of
the
directive
and
,
therefore
,
provide
for
two
separate
and
distinct
possibility
.
the
first
,
in
section
7
(
1
)
(
a
)
,
provide
for
a
situation
where
there
be
already
in
existence
a
comparable
employee
.
in
this
instance
,
close
regard
must
be
have
also
to
section
3
which
define
the
criterion
for
establish
a
comparable
employee
.
the
criterion
set
down
be
very
specific
and
cumulative
and
,
in
that
sense
,
do
not
allow
a
broad
interpretation
to
be
make
of
a
comparable
employee
.
separately
,
section
7
(
1
)
(
b
)
provide
for
instance
where
there
be
no
comparable
employee
,
in
which
case
the
term
and
condition
applicable
will
be
the
same
as
that
to
which
a
comparable
employee
would
,
if
directly
employ
,
be
entitle
.
this
be
compliant
with
the
directive
requirement
.
it
be
not
possible
to
move
beyond
this
,
as
the
amendment
seek
to
do
,
and
introduce
conditionality
,
effectively
a
water
down
of
the
provision
,
as
propose
,
because
we
would
run
the
risk
of
fall
foul
of
the
directive
requirement
.
as
in
the
case
of
section
7
(
1
)
(
a
)
,
this
provision
must
be
read
in
conjunction
with
section
3
.
a
further
amendment
bring
forward
to
assist
with
legal
certainty
on
the
issue
be
that
contain
in
section
7
(
3
)
which
provide
that
in
respect
of
agency
worker
on
assignment
prior
to
5
December
2011
,
although
the
assignment
may
end
after
that
date
,
the
effective
date
for
the
purpose
of
establish
equal
treatment
be
5
December
2011
.
the
Parliamentary
counsel
have
advise
that
the
directive
wording
do
not
facilitate
the
inclusion
of
the
conditionality
propose
in
the
text
of
the
Bill
.
in
this
regard
,
we
have
travel
as
far
as
we
can
legally
with
the
safeguard
contain
in
section
3
and
7(
3
)
which
be
design
to
assist
in
the
proper
implementation
of
the
provision
.
in
the
propose
amendment
to
section
7
(
2
)
Senator
Mary
Ann
O'Brien
be
,
in
effect
,
propose
a
deem
provision
to
certify
that
a
employer
would
be
deem
to
have
confer
the
entitlement
of
equal
treatment
on
a
agency
worker
where
it
be
demonstrate
that
this
be
at
least
the
same
as
that
applicable
to
a
comparable
employee
.
while
understand
the
rationale
for
the
amendment
,
I
be
advise
that
such
a
provision
be
extraneous
and
not
necessary
.
in
instance
where
there
be
comparable
employee
alongside
agency
worker
it
will
in
practice
be
the
case
that
employer
will
seek
to
demonstrate
that
equal
treatment
between
agency
worker
and
comparable
employee
apply
.
this
will
be
useful
in
provide
evidential
proof
.
it
be
a
matter
for
the
Senator
if
he
wish
to
call
a
vote
on
he
amendment
.
with
regard
to
the
consultation
process
,
people
be
send
letter
.
it
involve
the
usual
stakeholder
such
as
IBEC
.
no
.
we
can
provide
the
Senator
with
a
list
.
we
can
provide
a
list
.
the
minister
meet
the
National
Recruitment
Federation
,
individual
recruitment
agency
,
IDA
Ireland
,
IBEC
and
the
ICTU
.
there
be
a
extensive
consultation
process
on
the
issue
.
no
.
while
I
understand
the
rationale
behind
this
amendment
,
it
would
not
,
even
if
accept
,
have
any
material
effect
and
be
redundant
.
it
be
already
the
case
under
the
employment
legislation
that
a
contract
of
indefinite
duration
can
be
terminate
for
reason
such
as
redundancy
,
liquidation
of
the
employer
and
so
on
.
under
the
provision
of
the
exist
law
,
this
Bill
do
not
discommode
exist
law
in
this
context
.
I
be
certain
there
be
no
prescriptive
measure
lay
down
,
such
as
,
for
example
,
that
employee
must
be
a
member
of
a
trade
union
,
by
which
they
can
consult
under
the
provision
of
section
8
.
this
be
a
technical
amendment
which
seek
to
ensure
that
for
the
purpose
only
of
equal
treatment
of
working
and
employment
condition
for
agency
worker
that
be
part
-
time
employee
,
it
be
the
provision
of
this
legislation
and
not
that
of
the
Protection
of
employee
(
part
-
Time
work
)
act
2001
that
apply
.
in
effect
,
this
mean
that
whereas
in
that
act
,
the
appropriate
comparator
that
be
establish
for
a
agency
worker
be
another
agency
worker
,
that
be
supersede
by
this
legislation
,
which
take
as
the
appropriate
comparator
another
directly
recruit
employee
,
subject
to
the
criterion
of
section
3
.
I
understand
the
rationale
behind
this
amendment
.
the
provision
as
it
stand
,
however
,
list
the
facility
and
amenity
intend
.
while
the
list
be
not
exhaustive
,
it
be
not
intend
that
collective
facility
and
amenity
would
include
remuneration
or
expense
.
there
be
a
danger
in
introduce
one
propose
exclusion
as
to
do
so
would
raise
other
issue
that
could
be
equally
propose
for
exclusion
.
this
type
of
detail
be
more
appropriate
for
inclusion
in
guidance
documentation
on
the
Bill
in
preparation
in
my
Department
.
for
this
reason
,
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
amendment
no.
14
.
on
amendment
no.
15
,
it
be
not
suggest
in
the
legislation
nor
would
it
be
legally
possible
under
the
Bill
that
a
agency
worker
could
contend
that
there
be
any
employment
relationship
between
the
hirer
and
the
worker
on
the
basis
that
the
latter
now
have
a
entitlement
to
use
any
collective
facility
in
the
same
manner
as
direct
employee
.
the
definition
make
clear
there
be
a
three
way
relationship
and
the
employer
of
the
agency
worker
be
the
employment
agency
.
in
that
sense
,
the
amendment
be
unnecessary
.
