I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
amendment
no.
1
to
the
motion
regard
protect
community
from
the
unlawful
use
of
scrambler
motorcycle
and
quad
bike
in
public
space
.
yesterday
,
on
the
question
,
"
that
amendment
no.
1
to
the
motion
be
agree
to
"
,
a
division
be
claim
and
that
division
must
be
take
now
.
many
sport
in
Ireland
,
include
greyhound
racing
,
receive
state
funding
.
we
share
the
concern
of
the
many
people
who
have
express
deep
unease
about
the
welfare
of
greyhound
breed
for
racing
.
we
welcome
any
progress
on
the
welfare
of
greyhound
but
see
any
current
measure
as
only
the
first
step
on
a
very
long
road
.
there
be
a
long
way
to
go
before
anyone
can
safely
say
that
welfare
issue
have
be
address
to
everyone
's
satisfaction
.
for
many
year
,
the
Labour
Party
have
consistently
call
for
high
standard
of
animal
welfare
in
many
area
of
society
,
include
the
greyhound
sector
.
we
welcome
the
progress
which
have
be
make
to
advance
the
welfare
of
greyhound
.
since
2010
,
the
Labour
Party
have
endeavour
to
make
the
greyhound
racing
sector
operate
on
a
revenue
-
neutral
basis
by
ensure
that
a
percentage
of
the
funding
raise
through
the
betting
tax
be
use
to
support
the
sector
.
that
proposal
be
now
reality
.
the
Labour
Party
do
not
support
the
removal
of
State
funding
for
greyhound
racing
at
this
time
.
we
be
fearful
that
any
defunding
now
would
lead
to
the
gradual
resumption
of
a
regime
where
practice
be
not
subject
to
any
proper
scrutiny
.
the
Horse
and
Greyhound
Fund
give
the
taxpayer
power
.
it
make
the
taxpayer
the
scrutineer
of
all
welfare
practice
.
I
would
be
very
reluctant
to
remove
that
power
at
a
time
when
the
attention
pay
by
the
public
to
this
sector
have
never
be
great
.
we
will
continue
to
support
further
measure
to
enhance
the
welfare
of
greyhound
.
I
particularly
welcome
the
fact
that
10
%
of
the
state
funding
give
to
greyhound
racing
be
spend
exclusively
on
the
care
and
welfare
of
greyhound
.
this
be
a
positive
first
step
but
it
should
not
be
the
endpoint
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
sport
's
governing
body
,
Rásaíocht
Con
Éireann
,
have
be
implement
a
care
and
welfare
programme
.
however
,
the
government
amendment
be
a
cut-and
-
paste
job
base
on
a
Rásaíocht
Con
Éireann
briefing
note
.
this
amendment
do
nothing
for
the
sustainability
of
the
greyhound
sector
.
one
fundamental
issue
be
whether
the
board
of
Rásaíocht
Con
Éireann
enjoy
the
confidence
of
the
wide
public
and
its
own
stakeholder
on
deliver
on
the
agenda
of
animal
welfare
and
the
sustainability
of
the
sector
.
we
contend
that
the
only
way
to
ensure
confidence
be
to
make
tangible
improvement
beyond
the
measure
implement
so
far
.
for
instance
,
we
would
like
to
see
evidence
a
nationwide
roll
-
out
of
care
centre
similar
to
the
one
in
Tipperary
.
evidence
of
the
construction
of
a
second
centre
might
build
some
confidence
.
a
back
-
of
-
the
-
envelope
calculation
suggest
that
designate
10
%
of
the
fund
for
welfare
and
rehoming
would
allocate
€
1.9
million
to
the
purpose
.
that
be
a
significant
pot
of
money
,
which
will
not
be
available
if
funding
be
cut
or
phase
out
over
time
.
Public
trust
in
the
sector
and
the
administration
thereof
be
very
low
.
Recent
revelation
in
the
industry
be
proof
of
that
.
the
only
way
to
restore
that
trust
be
a
further
roll
-
out
of
care
centre
across
the
country
and
clear
evidence
of
rehoming
.
this
be
not
just
the
demand
of
the
public
.
owner
and
trainer
throughout
the
country
be
call
for
the
same
thing
.
in
my
experience
,
greyhound
owner
be
intelligent
people
who
know
instinctively
that
the
future
of
they
sector
,
which
be
loss
making
,
depend
on
a
transparent
and
world
-
class
welfare
and
rehoming
programme
that
demand
100
%
traceability
.
every
trainer
I
have
speak
to
be
look
forward
to
the
traceability
regime
and
accept
it
with
open
arm
.
such
a
regime
be
dependent
on
a
governance
structure
that
subject
the
expenditure
of
public
money
to
the
type
of
rigorous
oversight
we
witness
when
deputy
Alan
Kelly
have
the
sector
in
he
sight
at
the
Committee
on
Public
Account
.
we
need
further
evidence
of
the
roll
-
out
of
the
traceability
system
.
until
then
,
doubt
will
remain
.
turn
to
the
fund
itself
,
we
note
that
the
2010
Labour
Party
proposal
have
become
practice
.
back
then
,
we
propose
that
the
Horse
and
Greyhound
Fund
should
be
revenue
-
neutral
.
we
welcome
the
increase
in
the
betting
tax
,
which
yield
€
95
million
in
2019
.
we
fear
that
any
defunding
of
the
greyhound
sector
,
which
have
be
propose
in
the
many
email
I
have
receive
on
the
matter
,
would
force
animal
welfare
gain
backwards
.
we
contend
that
the
money
give
to
the
fund
give
the
taxpayer
skin
in
the
game
and
help
to
ensure
animal
welfare
and
traceability
standard
be
meet
.
I
note
that
the
motion
do
not
refer
to
the
horse
racing
industry
,
which
whether
we
like
it
or
not
also
have
serious
welfare
issue
.
if
the
fund
be
revenue
-
neutral
,
we
should
bag
the
very
small
gain
that
have
be
make
on
welfare
and
traceability
and
use
the
funding
to
make
further
gain
.
the
relevant
Oireachtas
committee
should
ensure
that
that
responsible
for
animal
welfare
in
the
horse
and
greyhound
sector
be
subject
to
rigorous
and
independent
scrutiny
on
a
regular
basis
.
for
instance
,
the
statement
by
the
board
refer
to
the
implementation
of
a
extensive
rehoming
programme
,
with
more
than
1300
greyhound
rehome
in
2020
to
date
with
assistance
from
the
Irish
retired
Greyhound
trust
,
should
be
subject
to
great
scrutiny
.
the
board
claim
that
the
traceability
system
will
ensure
that
important
event
in
the
life
of
racing
greyhound
,
include
birth
,
microchipping
,
registration
,
racing
career
,
change
of
ownership
or
trainer
location
,
export
,
retirement
and
end
of
life
,
be
accurately
record
.
this
should
be
subject
to
ongoing
and
rigorous
scrutiny
.
the
social
Democrat
be
right
to
shine
a
light
on
a
important
and
vital
sector
,
which
traverse
urban
and
rural
life
.
take
away
its
funding
be
not
the
good
way
to
bring
about
this
urgently
need
change
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
amendment
no.
1
in
the
name
of
Minister
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
to
the
motion
re
funding
for
the
Irish
greyhound
industry
.
this
morning
,
on
the
question
,
"
that
the
amendment
be
make
"
,
a
division
be
claim
and
that
division
must
be
take
now
.
I
welcome
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
before
we
tonight
and
the
fact
that
we
be
debate
this
issue
.
it
be
probably
the
first
time
we
have
be
able
to
hear
from
the
minister
formally
on
the
establishment
of
the
pension
commission
,
outside
of
the
normal
parliamentary
question
process
.
I
welcome
she
clarification
on
the
income
support
for
people
retire
at
age
65
and
I
welcome
she
statement
that
she
will
be
introduce
regulation
to
formally
remove
the
current
requirement
for
people
aged
65
and
over
to
sign
on
.
everybody
involved
in
the
Stop67
campaign
make
a
strong
impression
on
all
of
we
during
the
election
campaign
through
they
own
story
.
I
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
that
campaign
have
be
quite
influential
in
bring
about
a
outcome
that
ensure
people
do
not
have
to
face
the
ignominy
of
appear
before
a
social
protection
office
when
they
have
35
,
40
,
or
50
year
of
labour
under
they
belt
.
that
will
be
finally
and
formally
be
do
away
with
now
.
I
put
great
store
in
the
fact
that
the
Stop67
campaign
have
a
big
influence
or
impact
on
that
decision
.
I
stand
before
the
House
as
someone
who
be
a
member
of
the
government
when
the
decision
be
make
on
the
State
pension
transition
payment
.
I
be
deeply
regretful
about
that
decision
.
I
hear
from
people
after
that
,
the
very
people
about
whom
we
be
talk
tonight
,
who
have
put
such
time
and
effort
into
they
life
's
labour
and
have
to
suffer
indignity
at
the
end
of
they
working
life
.
that
be
something
I
will
always
regret
.
the
decision
be
make
at
a
time
when
there
be
economic
retrenchment
but
it
now
have
to
be
reverse
.
as
deputy
,
we
deal
with
social
protection
issue
every
day
of
the
week
and
have
a
intimate
knowledge
of
the
working
of
the
social
protection
architecture
.
we
must
ensure
that
the
State
pension
transition
be
restore
because
the
certainty
it
give
would
mean
much
to
people
at
the
end
of
they
working
life
.
I
do
not
say
that
seek
to
score
political
point
.
I
say
it
because
we
hear
from
people
about
this
,
day
in
,
day
out
,
and
we
all
buy
into
the
Stop67
campaign
and
hear
what
that
people
have
to
say
.
the
system
work
very
well
for
people
,
by
and
large
.
I
do
not
see
why
it
could
not
be
restore
or
at
least
look
at
.
I
welcome
the
establishment
of
the
pension
commission
.
I
do
not
necessarily
see
it
as
kick
the
can
down
the
line
.
I
welcome
it
primarily
because
of
how
it
be
constitute
.
there
be
member
on
that
committee
from
the
trade
union
movement
,
as
well
as
former
civil
servant
and
so
on
,
who
be
robust
people
.
I
do
not
want
to
speak
to
gender
per
se
,
but
they
be
all
decent
people
,
man
and
woman
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
they
will
be
cognisant
of
the
issue
of
gender
as
it
relate
to
low
-
pay
work
woman
in
this
country
,
about
whom
we
all
know
.
I
could
give
chapter
and
verse
of
example
of
low
-
pay
worker
but
I
be
not
go
to
do
that
tonight
.
we
all
deal
with
this
issue
.
sometimes
people
come
into
this
house
and
articulate
example
but
we
all
deal
with
this
across
the
House
,
no
matter
who
we
be
.
we
must
be
conscious
,
through
the
pension
commission
,
of
the
issue
of
gender
and
set
up
a
system
whereby
woman
,
particularly
that
in
labour
-
intensive
job
or
precarious
employment
,
who
come
to
the
end
of
they
working
life
do
not
have
to
go
through
another
firewall
or
have
to
knock
down
another
door
to
get
to
that
restful
period
,
to
which
everybody
expect
to
get
when
they
retire
from
they
year
or
decade
of
labour
.
the
pension
commission
will
hopefully
come
up
with
a
set
of
recommendation
that
speak
to
flexibility
and
the
issue
of
people
who
work
in
labour
-
intensive
or
extremely
stressful
job
.
I
think
of
front
-
line
worker
,
nurse
and
doctor
in
the
current
climate
.
if
this
people
have
do
so
many
year
's
work
and
be
retire
well
in
advance
of
65
,
a
framework
should
be
set
up
to
protect
they
in
order
that
they
do
not
lose
they
entitlement
.
we
need
a
system
that
reflect
the
new
paradigm
in
Irish
society
.
there
be
a
pension
time
bomb
but
we
also
need
to
allow
for
flexibility
,
in
order
to
reflect
the
new
reality
of
people
's
working
life
.
if
the
pension
commission
deal
with
that
it
will
have
do
a
good
day
's
work
,
but
only
if
the
minister
of
the
day
do
not
put
its
recommendation
up
on
a
shelf
to
gather
dust
.
nobody
want
that
and
that
be
not
what
anybody
be
suggest
.
the
composition
of
the
commission
itself
be
of
robust
,
august
people
who
will
not
be
find
want
when
it
come
to
explore
all
of
this
issue
.
I
note
that
the
term
of
reference
make
specific
mention
of
gender
and
to
demographic
.
I
support
the
motion
.
it
be
important
that
we
discuss
this
issue
because
of
the
differential
that
exist
between
jobseeker
's
allowance
or
benefit
and
the
pension
.
as
a
society
,
we
want
to
ensure
that
the
very
people
who
contact
deputy
through
the
Stop67
campaign
and
outside
of
that
campaign
,
such
as
the
citizen
who
come
through
we
constituency
office
door
with
they
own
testimony
on
this
issue
,
as
well
as
the
people
one
meet
on
the
street
,
man
and
woman
,
have
available
to
they
a
mechanism
that
allow
that
transition
to
take
place
as
seamlessly
as
possible
,
that
recognise
the
dignity
of
they
labour
and
toil
and
set
up
a
pension
architecture
that
be
realistic
,
that
speak
to
the
cost
and
the
demographic
fact
that
Irish
people
be
get
old
but
also
to
the
need
to
ensure
we
look
after
this
people
when
they
come
to
the
end
of
they
working
life
.
while
I
say
"
this
people
"
;
ultimately
,
we
be
all
this
people
across
profession
.
I
will
say
one
thing
on
the
composition
of
the
pension
commission
.
I
do
not
want
to
strike
a
discordant
note
about
it
.
we
be
all
very
mindful
of
the
Stop67
campaign
and
its
constituent
part
,
as
well
as
the
role
of
the
National
woman
's
Council
of
Ireland
in
advocate
for
woman
and
I
be
hopeful
that
they
would
be
part
of
this
because
of
they
advocacy
.
we
must
recognise
they
role
,
as
well
as
that
of
organisation
like
Age
Action
,
Active
Retirement
Ireland
and
SIPTU
,
that
be
all
under
the
umbrella
of
Stop67
.
the
decision
be
make
and
I
accept
it
but
its
mandate
under
that
umbrella
should
be
recognise
through
the
work
of
the
commission
.
I
think
it
will
be
but
we
should
not
lose
sight
of
that
campaign
's
work
because
it
be
vital
.
I
stand
before
the
House
and
acknowledge
the
decision
that
be
make
in
the
past
that
lead
to
the
scenario
that
leave
people
with
a
loss
of
dignity
after
they
year
of
labour
.
I
be
part
of
that
government
and
speak
personally
,
I
be
deeply
regretful
.
perhaps
we
should
have
revise
that
.
the
beauty
of
politics
and
policy
be
that
policy
can
be
reverse
to
reflect
new
reality
.
if
one
devise
a
policy
one
should
not
sit
on
it
until
kingdom
come
.
if
it
need
to
be
change
and
circumstance
dictate
,
then
one
can
always
change
that
policy
.
there
be
the
great
Denis
Naughten
,
who
be
a
minister
for
two
year
and
be
now
on
the
Opposition
bench
.
I
wish
he
well
.
I
thank
deputy
Clarke
again
.
I
be
not
one
for
sound
bite
at
all
.
I
be
more
a
person
of
action
in
respect
of
understand
exactly
what
be
go
wrong
behind
the
system
.
the
deputy
be
right
in
everything
she
say
.
I
will
not
contradict
one
bit
of
it
.
I
will
talk
about
the
MRC
for
one
moment
,
however
.
I
go
to
the
MRC
with
the
Minister
of
State
,
Deputy
Burke
and
Troy
,
in
August
and
September
.
I
meet
with
parent
,
family
and
friend
of
the
MRC
.
I
be
at
the
Bridge
House
and
the
Millennium
House
,
I
think
,
and
I
be
out
to
the
MRC
building
itself

I
first
wish
to
express
my
concern
at
report
that
the
out
-
of
-
hour
gp
service
in
the
Fermoy
and
Mitchelstown
area
will
cease
shortly
.
we
be
be
tell
that
a
stricture
be
be
put
on
that
service
on
the
basis
that
if
a
gp
be
over
the
age
of
60
or
be
pregnant
,
the
service
may
no
long
be
sustainable
.
this
be
very
worrying
news
and
if
taxpayer
's
money
be
be
use
to
fund
the
SouthDoc
service
,
the
matter
must
be
address
in
a
way
that
ensure
absolute
transparency
about
the
decision
-
making
process
.
we
do
not
want
to
see
a
loss
of
out
-
of
-
hour
service
in
the
north
Cork
area
.
second
,
the
issue
of
section
39
organisation
,
which
include
SouthDoc
,
worry
we
greatly
.
a
strike
will
be
hold
on
Tuesday
,
15
December
and
we
express
solidarity
with
the
worker
in
that
regard
.
we
want
to
ensure
that
worker
be
pay
and
get
they
due
reward
but
we
also
want
to
ensure
that
we
do
not
lose
service
in
this
area
.
I
welcome
the
response
insofar
as
the
Minister
of
State
have
state
on
the
dáil
record
that
,
"
there
be
no
plan
at
present
to
change
the
provision
of
SouthDoc
out
-
of
-
hour
service
in
Fermoy
and
Mitchelstown
.
"
I
welcome
the
fact
that
any
service
provision
change
would
have
to
be
subject
to
discussion
.
it
seem
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
acknowledge
that
this
be
a
private
organisation
.
the
key
point
be
that
there
must
be
transparency
about
any
decision
-
make
procedure
where
they
relate
to
the
diminution
of
service
for
a
massive
geographical
area
from
the
Blackwater
valley
,
the
Kerry
border
over
to
the
Waterford
border
,
cover
the
town
of
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
and
any
point
in
between
.
gps
have
tell
I
this
be
a
proposal
to
cut
off
a
centre
by
stealth
by
impose
guideline
about
gps
who
may
be
pregnant
or
over
60
year
.
do
that
automatically
remove
one
-
third
of
the
capacity
of
the
centre
in
Fermoy
.
that
be
unconscionable
and
something
we
must
push
back
against
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
,
but
we
be
hold
the
government
's
foot
to
the
fire
on
this
because
it
be
important
that
we
do
not
lose
the
service
.
I
take
the
Minister
of
State
to
be
a
decent
and
honourable
person
and
take
she
at
she
word
,
but
we
will
continue
to
monitor
this
situation
and
to
support
section
39
employee
because
we
want
to
ensure
that
we
do
not
lose
we
gp
out
-
of
-
hour
service
,
notwithstand
the
reduction
in
capacity
.
I
ask
for
a
bit
of
latitude
.
I
know
of
no
Irish
College
of
General
Practitioner
guideline
on
the
exclusion
of
gps
from
deliver
front
-
line
healthcare
on
the
basis
of
be
over
the
age
of
60
year
or
pregnant
.
I
would
caution
the
Minister
of
State
not
to
use
that
line
with
we
,
please
.
I
would
also
caution
against
the
use
of
the
word
elderly
in
characterise
certain
gps
.

I
want
to
keep
the
pressure
on
the
minister
in
respect
of
pay
rate
in
the
childcare
and
early
year
education
sector
.
we
have
sight
of
a
report
,
pathway
to
good
prospect
:
deliver
proper
term
and
condition
for
the
early
Year
Workforce
in
Ireland
,
of
which
the
minister
will
no
doubt
be
aware
.
it
be
produce
by
the
department
of
work
and
employment
study
at
the
University
of
Limerick
.
the
research
be
partly
fund
by
the
Irish
human
Right
and
Equality
Commission
.
the
report
state
that
the
sustainability
of
the
sector
be
under
pressure
because
"
[t
]
he
unsustainability
be
evidence
by
a
2019
survey
which
find
that
65
per
cent
of
3200
early
year
professional
do
not
expect
to
be
work
in
the
sector
in
five
year
's
time
"
.
when
will
there
be
a
sectoral
employment
order
or
some
such
mechanism
that
ensure
we
can
retain
staff
and
pay
they
properly
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
but
I
want
to
pin
he
down
a
little
more
in
respect
of
what
he
say
about
joint
labour
committee
.
he
state
that
work
be
progress
,
but
it
would
be
useful
if
we
have
more
definitive
timeline
and
if
we
know
what
the
expectation
be
for
a
successful
outcome
to
that
such
that
it
can
be
guarantee
that
there
will
be
a
improvement
in
the
pay
and
condition
at
the
end
of
the
process
.
the
minister
tell
we
that
he
and
he
Department
be
not
the
employer
,
but
he
be
very
mindful
that
the
sustainability
of
the
sector
be
in
question
because
,
even
though
there
be
increase
demand
for
worker
within
the
sector
,
that
be
not
be
meet
with
increase
rate
of
pay
to
reflect
that
demand
.
we
would
like
to
hear
from
the
minister
a
more
definitive
timeline
and
a
sense
of
what
he
expectation
be
.
there
be
a
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
,
as
he
note
.
we
would
like
to
know
when
he
expect
that
commitment
to
be
deliver
on
.
I
believe
the
minister
to
be
genuine
in
the
agenda
he
be
pursue
on
this
.
I
welcome
he
reply
and
fully
acknowledge
that
he
cannot
give
a
definitive
timeline
,
and
it
be
useful
for
we
to
have
some
sense
of
the
working
,
but
we
want
this
to
end
up
as
a
interminable
process
that
outlive
the
potential
mandate
of
any
sit
government
.
the
worker
in
the
sector
expect
clear
timeline
and
clear
deliverable
and
it
be
reasonable
that
they
should
not
have
to
wait
two
or
three
year
before
they
see
some
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
,
which
be
the
essential
point
I
be
make
.
I
want
to
keep
the
pressure
on
the
minister
in
respect
of
ensure
that
we
all
move
towards
a
scenario
in
this
country
whereby
people
be
give
a
proper
wage
for
the
work
they
do
and
in
recognition
of
they
qualification

however
,
one
would
have
to
look
at
that

in
a
medium
to
long

perspective
.
there
be
approximately
5000
application

up

what
be
the

state
there

what
can
I

can
the

give
that
person
?
be

the

mention
that
she
intend
to
recruit

.
will
they
be
employ
on
a
full

basis
?
will
there
be
a
permanent

as
oppose
to
external
staff
who
be
bring
in
on
a

?
will
the

assurance
that
all

will
be
on

full

so
that

I
thank
the
Deputy
and
acknowledge
that
this
be
a
difficult
situation
.
Covid

the

that

it
have
have
to
develop

to
carry

a
manner
as
possible
.
the
decision
to
close

have
be
take
by

it

inconvenient
for

indeed

who
accompany

,
the
fact
be
that
if

there
be

the

to
carry
out
they
job
in
as
safe
a
manner
as
possible
.
the
decision
to
close
waiting
room
and
restrict
access
to
washing
facility
have
be
take
by
the
rsa
to
safeguard
staff
and
public
alike
in
line
with
this
protocol
.
it
follow
the
approach
take
by
many
organisation
where
access
traditionally
grant
to
member
of
the
public
to
use
staff
facility
have
be
withdraw
for
the
protection
of
public
health
.
while
the
authority
recognise
that
this
may
be
inconvenient
for
partner
,
family
member
and
indeed
driving
instructor
who
accompany
learner
driver
to
they
test
,
the
fact
be
that
if
more
people
enter
a
building
,
there
be
a
great
risk
of
Covid
spread
.
the
safety
of
staff
and
the
public
in
general
must
remain
the
Road
Safety
Authority
's
number
one
priority
at
this
time
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
and
acknowledge
that
this
be
a
difficult
situation
.
Covid
-19
have
be
disruptive
to
a
number
of
setting
.
this
be
a
operational
matter
for
the
rsa
and
driving
instructor
operate
as
independent
business
.
they
be
not
employ
by
either
the
Department
of
Transport
or
the
Road
Safety
Authority
.
Driver
tester
be
direct
employee
of
the
Road
Safety
Authority
and
,
like
any
employer
,
the
Road
Safety
Authority
have
a
duty
of
care
to
that
employee
.
that
be
why
it
have
have
to
develop
protocol
to
allow
tester
to
carry
out
they
job
in
as
safe
a
manner
as
possible
.
the
decision
to
close

.
the
Labour
Party
will
be
support
the
Bill
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
,
if
only
because
it
repeal
the
section
in
regard
to
the
pension
age
.
it
be
something
we
discuss
in
the
last
week
on
foot
of
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
and
we
welcome
it
wholeheartedly
.
again
,
I
wish
to
pay
tribute
to
the
Stop67
campaign
,
without
which
this
issue
would
not
have
reach
the
level
of
political
importance
that
it
have
reach
in
the
past
year
or
so
.
I
want
to
pay
tribute
again
to
the
National
woman
's
Council
,
Age
Action
,
Active
Retirement
Ireland
and
SIPTU
.
in
repeal
that
section
,
which
be
so
injurious
to
all
of
that
people
,
when
do
the
minister
propose
to
give
effect
to
that
measure
?
last
week
,
the
minister
state
:
in
addition
to
repeal
the
increase
in
the
pension
age
,
I
will
also
shortly
be
introduce
regulation
which
will
formally
remove
the
current
requirement
for
people
aged
65
and
over
to
sign
on
,
participate
in
activation
programme
or
give
a
undertaking
that
they
be
genuinely
seek
work
.
the
idea
,
therefore
,
that
any
65
-
year
-
old
will
have
to
stand
in
a
dole
queue
be
absolute
nonsense
.
I
be
formalise
a
administrative
practice
which
have
already
be
in
place
for
some
time
.
while
the
payment
rate
of
€
203
for
65
-
year
-
old
be
less
than
the
full
contributory
pension
rate
,
it
be
worth
bear
in
mind
that
a
65
-
year
-
old
receive
€
203
per
week
here
be
still
good
off
than
any
pensioner
in
Northern
Ireland
.
notwithstanding
the
commentary
in
respect
of
Northern
Ireland
,
it
would
be
very
useful
to
hear
from
the
minister
when
she
propose
to
introduce
the
statutory
regulation
,
if
she
have
not
already
sign
they
.
that
will
give
a
lot
of
comfort
to
people
who
be
welcoming
the
repeal
of
that
section
in
the
legislation
,
but
who
do
not
want
,
to
use
the
minister
's
word
,
to
have
to
stand
in
a
dole
queue
.
that
be
one
issue
on
which
I
seek
clarification
.
again
,
I
want
to
pay
tribute
to
the
National
woman
's
Council
,
Age
Action
,
Active
Retirement
Ireland
and
SIPTU
for
they
wonderful
work
in
go
out
and
campaign
,
develop
a
strong
consciousness
around
this
issue
and
co-ordinate
a
strong
campaign
that
have
borne
fruit
.
it
be
great
to
welcome
this
because
they
have
be
vindicate
in
they
position
.
I
want
to
raise
the
issue
of
fraud
with
the
minister
,
particularly
in
respect
of
the
pup
.
we
know
there
be
matter
which
be
before
the
court
today
and
yesterday
,
so
I
be
very
conscious
of
any
public
commentary
in
respect
of
the
issue
of
fraud
or
allege
fraud
with
regard
to
the
pup
.
I
merely
wish
to
ask
the
minister
if
she
Department
have
make
any
projection
in
respect
of
amount
that
may
have
be
fraudulently
obtain
as
a
result
of
application
make
for
pup
.
we
absolutely
welcome
the
initiative
whereby
the
Department
of
social
Protection
be
work
hand
in
hand
with
the
Garda
National
economic
crime
Bureau
because
it
could
be
say
,
by
any
objective
analysis
,
that
this
be
bear
fruit
.
it
be
important
work
and
I
hope
it
would
continue
to
be
resource
because
it
be
vitally
necessary
that
the
integrity
of
we
social
protection
system
be
maintain
,
and
that
everybody
have
confidence
in
that
system
.
the
more
resource
that
can
be
apply
to
that
effort
,
the
more
confidence
people
will
have
in
the
system
.
it
be
important
,
if
the
integrity
of
the
system
be
to
be
maintain
for
people
who
have
entitlement
,
that
where
fraud
exist
,
it
be
weed
out
and
eradicate
,
people
be
subject
to
the
law
and
the
law
be
apply
rigorously
where
incident
occur
.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
the
minister
in
respect
of
anti-fraud
measure
.
that
be
my
second
point
.
give
the
season
we
be
in
,
I
want
to
refer
to
seasonal
employment
.
we
be
hear
on
the
ground
that
for
many
people
who
would
have
work
in
the
hospitality
sector
on
a
seasonal
basis
,
particularly
lead
into
the
Christmas
period
but
also
during
the
summer
period
,
there
be
a
reluctance
on
the
part
of
some
to
give
up
they
pup
and
to
go
back
to
that
seasonal
employment
because
they
have
a
genuine
fear
that
,
if
they
do
so
,
they
pup
will
be
lose
and
go
forever
.
I
seek
a
assurance
from
the
minister
that
where
people
do
take
up
employment
,
albeit
on
a
seasonal
basis
,
there
be
no
fear
of
they
lose
they
pup
when
they
finish
that
employment
.
if
the
minister
could
speak
to
that
issue
to
reiterate
assurance
she
have
give
previously
on
that
it
would
also
send
a
very
positive
signal
.
she
state
in
she
contribution
that
if
someone
have
to
reapply
in
January
,
he
or
she
will
be
able
to
do
that
up
to
a
include
31
March
.
we
take
she
at
she
word
on
that
but
it
be
important
for
that
message
to
go
out
because
I
know
from
talk
to
employer
that
they
be
find
it
difficult
to
bring
people
back
into
the
workplace
again
.
that
be
a
issue
I
hope
will
be
address
.
there
have
be
much
news
make
of
the
fact
that
there
will
be
a
commitment
to
nine
week
pay
parental
leave
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
the
commitment
by
the
minister
,
deputy
O'Gorman
,
be
welcome
but
that
the
nine
week
pay
parental
leave
be
a
minimum
requirement
of
a
EU
directive
which
the
government
be
legally
compel
to
introduce
anyway
.
the
payment
be
fund
from
social
insurance
contribution
and
not
by
the
State
.
it
be
,
therefore
,
fund
by
people
's
own
contribution
.
it
would
be
useful
to
have
the
perspective
of
the
Minister
and
the
Department
of
social
Protection
on
the
nine
week
and
whether
there
will
be
extension
beyond
that
nine
week
in
the
foreseeable
future
so
as
to
make
parental
leave
,
as
a
policy
,
as
family
-
friendly
as
possible
.
Council
directive
2010/18
/
EU
establish
a
minimum
of
four
month
of
parental
leave
.
at
least
one
out
of
the
four
month
be
non-transferable
from
a
parent
to
another
and
there
be
no
minimum
compensation
during
parental
leave
at
EU
level
.
as
of
2
August
2022
,
Council
directive
2019
/
1158
establish
a
minimum
of
four
month
of
parental
leave
.
at
least
two
out
of
the
four
month
be
non-transferable
from
a
parent
to
another
.
at
least
the
two
non-transferable
month
have
to
be
adequately
compensate
at
a
level
to
be
decide
in
each
EU
country
as
of
2
August
2024
for
the
past
two
week
and
parent
have
the
right
to
request
take
the
leave
in
a
flexible
-
mean
part
-
time
-
and
piecemeal
way
.
it
would
be
very
useful
to
have
the
perspective
of
the
minister
in
respect
of
parental
leave
.
while
,
technically
,
it
be
not
she
line
Department
,
the
issue
of
social
insurance
contribution
very
much
dovetail
with
she
Department
and
I
be
sure
she
have
a
perspective
on
that
.
what
we
want
in
any
progressive
society
be
to
ensure
that
we
do
not
operate
to
the
minimum
or
to
the
directive
but
that
we
seek
to
find
mechanism
to
ensure
great
flexibility
such
that
work
mother
in
particular
can
avail
of
as
much
leave
as
possible
,
and
work
father
as
well
.
if
there
be
one
thing
the
first
lockdown
have
teach
I
as
a
public
representative
,
it
be
that
when
there
be
a
absence
of
childcare
,
it
have
a
massive
impact
on
work
mother
in
particular
.
I
believe
we
have
not
fully
analyse
the
impact
it
have
have
on
work
mother
in
respect
of
they
career
prospect
and
as
we
be
try
to
move
towards
a
more
equal
society
and
as
the
research
become
more
embed
,
and
I
know
the
ESRI
have
do
some
research
on
that
,
we
need
to
ensure
that
we
can
create
pathway
for
woman
,
and
work
mother
in
particular
,
such
that
no
impediment
be
put
in
they
way
and
that
the
parental
leave
arrangement
put
in
place
by
the
State
be
do
in
a
progressive
way
and
not
just
to
a
minimum
EU
requirement
.
I
know
the
minister
will
also
have
a
view
on
that
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
.
we
welcome
also
that
the
work
of
the
stop
67
campaign
be
very
much
inculcate
and
embed
within
this
legislation
.
I
pay
tribute
to
that
involved
in
that
.
we
believe
this
Bill
be
worthy
of
support
.
I
want
to
raise
a
final
issue
in
the
time
available
to
I
.
the
minister
have
speak
to
this
issue
previously
and
other
deputy
have
raise
it
with
she
.
it
be
in
respect
of
the
request
for
pps
number
.
many
employer
and
perspective
employer
have
apply
for
pps
number
for
prospective
employee
.
in
the
time
since
the
minister
last
speak
on
that
publicly
and
in
this
house
,
have
further
improvement
be
make
such
that
when
people
make
a
application
for
a
pps
number
that
application
be
expedite
in
as
timely
a
manner
as
possible
?
I
recognise
that
because
of
the
pup
resource
and
people
have
to
be
allocate
into
that
section
.
that
be
fully
acknowledge
by
everybody
here
but
if
pps
number
be
be
allocate
it
mean
that
people
be
at
work
.
if
people
be
at
work
,
they
be
contribute
.
I
ask
the
minister
for
a
update
on
progress
in
respect
of
that
.
I
thank
deputy
for
they
contribution
to
the
debate
on
this
Bill
.
health
insurance
be
hold
by
a
large
proportion
of
people
in
Ireland
relative
to
other
country
,
as
have
be
state
by
many
deputy
.
it
be
important
that
we
take
the
opportunity
to
discuss
this
Bill
and
the
positive
effect
that
community
rating
and
other
aspect
of
health
insurance
regulation
have
on
people
's
daily
life
.
the
voluntary
health
insurance
system
in
Ireland
operate
on
the
basis
of
community
rating
,
mean
people
who
be
old
or
sick
do
not
have
to
pay
more
than
the
young
and
healthy
.
community
rating
be
a
fundamental
cornerstone
of
the
Irish
health
insurance
system
and
in
other
health
insurance
system
.
the
level
of
risk
present
by
a
individual
directly
affect
the
premium
pay
.
the
objective
of
community
rating
be
support
by
a
risk
equalisation
scheme
which
aim
to
keep
health
insurance
affordable
for
old
and
less
healthy
member
.
under
the
scheme
,
all
the
money
raise
on
levy
from
insurer
be
pay
into
a
fund
for
the
sole
purpose
of
support
the
market
in
the
form
of
credit
payable
.
the
purpose
of
this
Bill
be
to
specify
the
revise
credit
and
corresponding
stamp
duty
level
to
apply
on
health
insurance
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
for
the
issue
they
have
raise
.
deputy
Cullinane
,
Patricia
Ryan
,
O'Rourke
and
Shortall
talk
about
Sláintecare
.
I
hope
that
Sláintecare
will
eventually
impact
on
implement
the
removal
of
private
healthcare
.
it
will
happen
progressively
.
anyone
with
health
insurance
can
continue
to
receive
private
care
in
public
hospital
for
the
foreseeable
future
.
after
that
,
anybody
with
private
health
insurance
will
still
be
able
to
receive
private
care
in
private
hospital
.
when
there
be
certainty
about
the
timeframe
for
the
implementation
of
Sláintecare
and
a
public
-
only
consultant
contract
,
a
broad
discussion
on
the
role
of
private
health
insurance
will
follow
.
we
be
commit
to
introduce
Sláintecare
as
soon
as
possible
.
deputy
Ó
Murchú
and
Gould
talk
about
addiction
service
.
I
would
be
concerned
that
the
€
90
cost
for
a
assessment
for
treatment
be
a
barrier
.
I
ask
deputy
Gould
if
he
could
raise
that
again
because
we
want
to
support
recovery
,
especially
for
people
in
addiction
service
.
deputy
Naughten
talk
about
Irish
Life
Health
,
and
how
one
major
insurer
be
not
support
level
2
hospital
such
as
Clonmel
,
Louth
,
Roscommon
and
many
more
.
there
be
no
obligation
for
insurer
to
cover
all
the
hospital
in
the
manner
outline
because
it
limit
the
commercial
decision
of
the
insurer
.
we
would
be
concerned
that
this
would
increase
the
cost
if
legislation
try
to
oblige
insurer
to
cover
all
hospital
for
treatment
,
procedure
etc
.
I
agree
with
deputy
Naughten
and
I
be
familiar
with
Roscommon
University
Hospital
.
it
be
a
level
2
hospital
and
much
great
work
have
happen
there
.
we
need
to
try
to
talk
to
the
gps
and
many
other
stakeholder
,
to
say
that
there
be
good
,
quick
treatment
available
at
level
2
hospital
than
at
level
3
or
4
hospital
.
they
have
a
role
there
and
deputy
Naughten
have
a
point
.
deputy
O'Connor
talk
about
cost
system
and
outside
provider
.
we
keep
a
eye
on
it
.
deputy
Michael
Collins
talk
about
a
young
child
in
Cork
.
if
he
write
to
I
and
the
Department
,
we
will
follow
up
on
that
serious
issue
and
try
to
sort
it
out
or
see
exactly
what
be
happen
.
although
the
private
health
insurance
market
have
demonstrate
resilience
and
remain
reasonably
stable
amid
significant
uncertainty
in
2020
,
the
long
-
term
impact
of
Covid
-
19
on
the
health
insurance
industry
have
yet
to
be
determine
.
against
the
background
of
some
uncertainty
about
the
potential
impact
on
market
profile
and
membership
,
the
credit
and
levy
rate
for
next
year
strike
a
fair
balance
between
the
need
to
support
community
rating
and
maintain
the
sustainability
of
the
market
.
deputy
Pringle
have
some
interesting
point
about
health
insurance
.
he
make
a
interesting
point
about
credit
union
and
we
must
have
a
discussion
about
that
in
the
future
.
the
Bill
allow
we
to
maintain
support
for
the
core
principle
of
community
rating
,
which
be
long
-
establish
and
well
-
support
government
policy
for
the
health
insurance
market
.
the
Bill
will
ensure
that
we
can
continue
to
provide
the
necessary
support
to
ensure
that
the
cost
of
health
insurance
be
share
across
the
insure
population
.
I
read
the
Minister
's
speech
as
he
be
deliver
it
.
I
ask
he
to
consider
the
Labour
Party
Bill
,
which
be
also
publish
yesterday
,
entitle
the
Adoption
(
Information
and
Tracing
)
Bill
2021
.
if
it
be
pass
,
it
will
provide
adopt
person
with
the
right
to
access
they
birth
certificate
.
I
note
the
Sinn
Féin
Bill
of
deputy
Funchion
and
that
Senator
Bacik
have
contact
she
office
yesterday
to
consider
this
Bill
.
if
a
Bill
emerge
from
this
bill
which
we
can
all
support
that
deal
with
this
issue
finally
and
in
a
timely
fashion
,
this
will
provide
some
confidence
to
the
many
people
who
have
be
advocate
on
this
issue
for
many
year
.
I
take
in
good
faith
the
minister
's
statement
that
we
will
have
the
head
of
the
Bill
on
information
and
trace
by
the
end
of
March
or
early
April
.
be
there
a
way
of
shorten
that
time
,
give
that
the
minister
's
predecessor
have
be
give
consideration
to
this
matter
for
a
number
of
year
and
the
issue
have
be
in
the
system
for
too
long
already
?
we
feel
strongly
that
the
legislation
to
speak
to
the
issue
of
the
right
to
access
birth
certificate
could
be
implement
tomorrow
if
the
political
will
be
there
.
we
ask
that
the
timeframe
be
address
again
.
this
be
a
issue
on
which
people
want
to
see
closure
or
progress
.
I
accept
that
there
be
a
process
,
but
it
be
one
that
have
be
ongoing
for
a
number
of
year
and
be
on
the
minister
's
predecessor
's
desk
for
a
number
of
year
as
well
.
it
be
not
a
new
issue
.
we
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
many
people
,
but
I
wish
to
mention
two
whose
material
I
have
read
extensively
.
they
have
be
instrumental
in
raise
consciousness
about
this
issue
.
I
be
refer
to
Mr.
Conall
Ó
Fátharta
,
a
journalist
who
write
for
the
Irish
Examiner
,
and
Mr.
Donal
O'Keeffe
,
a
documentarian
,
historian
and
commentator
.
Mr.
O'Keeffe
be
responsible
for
put
together
the
list
of
name
that
appear
in
the
Irish
Examiner
last
week
.
I
thank
the
Irish
Examiner
for
carry
the
list
on
its
front
page
.
that
mere
act
raise
consciousness
about
this
issue
among
many
people
for
whom
it
otherwise
would
not
have
be
bring
home
so
starkly
in
this
time
of
Covid
.
that
front
page
be
a
important
piece
of
work
.
it
be
now
a
historical
document
and
have
do
much
to
raise
awareness
of
the
issue
.
it
have
do
a
great
duty
in
bring
home
to
we
the
reality
of
the
sheer
number
of
young
baby
who
die
in
such
horrific
circumstance
.
deputy
McDonald
be
right
,
in
that
if
we
generation
of
politician
do
not
deal
with
this
now
,
we
will
not
be
able
to
look
we
child
and
,
hopefully
,
grandchild
in
the
eye
when
they
ask
we
what
we
do
about
mother
and
baby
home
without
cast
we
gaze
downwards
.
we
have
to
address
this
issue
now
.
base
on
he
word
to
date
,
I
believe
the
minister
be
willing
to
do
so
.
I
do
not
say
this
in
a
condescending
way
,
but
if
I
may
,
I
implore
he
to
ensure
that
we
do
not
go
down
the
road
that
have
be
take
before
with
report
of
this
nature
where
we
have
see
evidence
of
internal
memo
write
by
senior
people
in
Department
where
sympathy
be
express
for
the
issue
but
cost
become
a
determine
cause
for
inaction
.
we
can
not
be
a
generation
of
politician
that
become
part
of
the
edifice
of
historical
issue
not
be
deal
with
because
cost
be
a
factor
.
I
respectfully
ask
the
minister
that
,
as
a
first
step
,
when
the
interdepartmental
group
meet
to
assess
the
provision
of
a
form
of
enhance
medical
card
for
anyone
who
spend
more
than
six
month
in
a
mother
and
baby
institution
,
the
timeframe
should
be
consider
because
anyone
who
spend
even
a
hour
in
such
a
institution
should
have
that
right
.
six
month
be
too
arbitrary
.
if
the
minister
start
with
this
gesture
,
it
would
build
confidence
among
the
many
people
who
have
be
hurt
and
traumatise
by
they
experience
.
it
would
be
a
meaningful
gesture
for
many
.
I
have
raise
two
issue
-
the
information
and
tracing
Bill
and
medical
card
.
if
they
could
be
deal
with
immediately
,
it
would
build
confidence
in
what
will
be
a
long
process
.
I
acknowledge
the
workload
lie
ahead
of
the
minister
.
we
will
work
with
he
as
a
committee
.
I
stand
as
a
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Children
,
Disability
,
Equality
and
Integration
.
we
will
do
everything
we
can
to
help
the
minister
and
he
colleague
in
whatever
process
need
to
be
undertake
.
this
be
not
a
partisan
issue
,
but
one
that
we
all
must
deal
with
collectively
.
a
few
minute
be
leave
to
I
.
I
note
the
minister
's
reference
to
Ms
Litster
and
the
experience
in
Tuam
.
I
wish
to
acknowledge
the
role
of
Dr.
James
Deeny
,
the
former
Chief
Medical
Adviser
who
be
active
in
respect
of
Bessborough
.
between
1922
and
the
end
of
1946
,
674
child
be
officially
certify
as
have
die
at
that
home
.
that
be
not
the
sum
total
of
child
who
die
at
the
home
.
one
report
-
I
be
sorry
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
-
state
that
"
the
great
number
"
be
"
miserable
scrap
of
humanity
,
wizened
,
some
emaciated
,
and
almost
all
have
rash
and
sore
all
over
they
body
,
face
,
hand
and
head
"
.
Dr.
Deeny
visit
and
inspect
the
home
in
Bessborough
.
he
note
that
it
be
spotlessly
clean
.
he
write
:
"
I
march
up
and
down
and
around
about
and
could
not
make
out
what
be
wrong
;
at
last
I
take
a
notion
and
strip
all
the
baby
and
,
unusually
for
a
Chief
Medical
Adviser
,
examine
they
.
"
as
he
recall
in
he
1989
memoir
,
"
every
baby
have
some
purulent
infection
of
the
skin
and
all
have
green
diarrhoea
,
carefully
cover
up
.
"
forgive
I
for
get
upset
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
,
but
this
have
to
be
deal
with
.
we
have
to
deal
with
it
.
we
have
to
acknowledge
and
face
up
to
the
fact
that
it
happen
and
we
have
to
find
a
mechanism
for
every
woman
,
child
and
family
member
who
have
any
contact
with
any
home
throughout
the
State
.
justice
will
be
serve
when
they
feel
they
have
receive
some
acknowledgement
of
the
hurt
that
be
cause
to
they
.
we
can
achieve
that
through
redress
,
proper
mechanism
and
a
revision
of
the
executive
summary
,
which
be
a
insult
to
they
-
the
minister
describe
its
language
as
cold
.
the
first
point
of
departure
should
be
the
report
itself
.
it
have
cause
trauma
and
hurt
again
.
that
be
not
a
good
starting
point
and
I
ask
that
the
executive
summary
be
address
.
before
I
read
my
speech
,
I
will
first
respond
to
a
question
from
deputy
Connolly
,
which
be
also
ask
early
by
deputy
Devlin
,
about
copy
of
the
report
.
in
short
,
approximately
200
hard
copy
of
the
abrid
report
have
be
send
out
to
date
.
of
that
,
75
be
post
on
the
day
of
publication
to
the
survivor
and
they
representative
and
to
select
member
,
deputy
and
Senator
.
since
then
,
123
request
for
the
abrid
version
have
be
receive
to
date
and
a
copy
have
be
post
to
all
of
that
who
request
they
.
there
have
be
247
request
for
copy
of
the
full
report
.
they
be
in
stock
and
the
distribution
company
be
organise
the
distribution
at
the
moment
.
any
of
the
survivor
who
would
like
to
get
a
copy
can
contact
the
Department
of
Children
,
Equality
,
Disability
,
Integration
and
Youth
and
the
report
will
be
send
directly
to
they
at
no
cost
whatsoever
.
I
hope
that
answer
the
question
.
it
be
my
second
time
also
to
contribute
on
this
matter
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
address
the
House
a
week
after
a
landmark
moment
of
truth
for
the
State
and
for
the
people
.
I
thank
everybody
who
bring
response
,
story
and
feedback
from
they
constituent
into
the
Chamber
today
and
for
the
ongoing
engagement
with
the
survivor
,
which
be
critical
.
many
question
have
be
ask
throughout
the
past
three
and
a
half
hour
and
I
do
not
have
the
answer
to
all
of
they
,
but
the
minister
,
deputy
O'Gorman
,
have
sit
through
the
entire
debate
,
and
between
he
and
the
Department
,
answer
will
go
back
to
Deputy
.
there
be
a
strong
onus
on
we
now
not
to
do
further
damage
to
a
community
of
people
who
have
be
so
desperately
let
down
time
and
again
.
to
speak
about
survivor
as
one
group
,
a
singular
entity
,
and
to
suggest
that
all
of
they
have
have
the
same
experience
and
currently
have
the
same
need
and
desire
be
yet
again
to
ignore
they
,
demean
they
and
refuse
to
acknowledge
they
precise
individuality
.
during
my
year
hold
clinic
in
Galway
East
I
have
meet
so
many
survivor
from
mother
and
baby
home
and
county
home
across
the
constituency
.
no
two
of
they
have
have
the
same
experience
and
no
two
of
they
have
the
same
idea
about
what
redress
mean
to
they
.
there
be
as
many
story
as
survivor
.
we
have
a
obligation
as
a
government
to
listen
and
to
meet
they
need
.
we
be
go
to
do
so
in
the
follow
way
.
the
most
common
thread
we
have
hear
be
that
people
want
to
share
they
story
,
to
tell
the
horror
and
trauma
of
they
past
and
to
be
believe
.
that
be
the
reason
the
commission
be
set
up
in
2015
and
its
report
have
now
be
publish
online
without
editing
or
redaction
.
I
spend
the
past
week
listen
to
the
response
of
survivor
and
they
family
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
it
must
have
be
a
gruelling
,
exhausting
and
traumatising
week
for
they
all
.
while
many
be
happy
to
be
move
into
the
next
phase
of
address
the
past
,
many
other
be
upset
at
the
tone
and
language
use
in
the
report
.
we
have
hear
in
the
Chamber
today
that
it
be
awful
that
some
of
the
witness
feel
that
they
story
be
misrepresent
or
that
the
lack
of
evidence
report
make
they
feel
they
be
not
believe
or
that
they
be
lie
.
I
assure
they
that
nobody
think
they
be
lie
.
I
would
like
to
highlight
some
of
the
story
.
one
woman
's
son
be
three
and
a
half
year
of
age
when
a
nun
say
to
she
,
"
it
be
happen
.
"
she
do
not
have
time
to
say
goodbye
but
she
have
enough
time
to
run
up
to
the
top
of
the
stair
to
see
she
son
as
he
be
be
drive
away
.
it
break
she
heart
that
he
be
part
from
she
.
another
woman
be
bring
into
a
shop
in
town
and
tell
to
sign
a
document
that
be
half
cover
.
what
she
be
actually
sign
be
a
adoption
and
when
she
return
to
the
home
the
baby
be
gone
.
another
witness
tell
the
committee
that
she
have
tell
a
nun
of
she
plan
to
go
to
England
with
she
baby
.
the
nun
respond
,
"
that
do
not
happen
here
.
you
will
do
what
we
tell
you
and
that
be
it
.
you
be
not
keep
that
baby
.
you
be
go
nowhere
with
that
baby
.
you
be
go
home
and
the
baby
be
go
somewhere
else
.
"
a
18
-
year
-
old
have
to
hand
over
she
baby
like
a
parcel
while
she
father
force
she
to
sign
she
name
on
adoption
paper
.
one
woman
say
she
be
tell
to
shut
she
mouth
and
sign
.
in
the
case
of
another
woman
,
when
she
child
be
three
week
old
,
a
nun
walk
into
the
nursery
and
snatch
she
baby
from
she
.
this
be
the
language
use
to
describe
this
adoption
:
"
snatch
"
,
"
order
to
give
away
"
,
"
make
to
hand
over
"
,
"
give
I
no
choice
"
,
"
without
consent
"
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
this
be
simply
replacement
word
for
be
force
.
we
believe
they
story
.
the
language
use
by
the
commission
be
officious
and
technical
.
the
evidence
,
perhaps
,
that
the
commission
mean
be
the
documentation
that
the
nun
and
organisation
should
have
keep
to
assist
people
in
trace
they
lineage
and
they
family
.
if
we
take
evidence
as
mean
documentation
and
physical
evidence
,
it
be
a
hard
thing
for
we
to
get
we
head
around
.
it
be
possible
for
two
conflict
thing
to
be
true
at
the
same
time
.
it
be
possible
for
someone
to
have
be
force
to
give
up
they
baby
for
adoption
and
it
be
possible
that
there
would
be
no
evidence
of
that
.
it
be
possible
for
someone
to
have
be
abuse
and
for
there
to
be
no
evidence
of
that
.
unfortunately
,
the
people
who
commit
that
act
must
have
know
what
they
be
do
be
wrong
.
when
people
commit
wrongdoing
,
they
very
rarely
keep
robust
documentation
and
record
of
they
action
.
we
believe
this
woman
and
we
want
to
help
they
.
one
of
the
area
not
discuss
in
the
public
arena
to
date
,
and
again
today
,
be
the
matter
of
that
people
with
disability
and
how
they
be
treat
in
mother
and
baby
home
.
much
can
be
learn
by
the
chapter
title
under
which
this
matter
be
deal
,
Chapter
31
:
discrimination
.
it
highlight
the
extent
of
the
limited
knowledge
of
the
professional
at
the
time
,
as
well
as
the
wide
struggle
of
State
and
society
with
how
to
support
that
with
disability
.
the
language
use
at
the
time
be
hard
to
read
,
with
woman
or
child
with
disability
often
refer
to
as
"
slow
"
,
"
backward
"
or
"
mentally
deficient
"
.
this
people
be
truly
"
othered
"
.
the
commission
note
that
regardless
of
one
's
place
of
birth
,
incidence
of
discrimination
for
that
with
a
disability
be
significant
.
the
commission
add
that
it
hear
no
representation
by
or
on
behalf
of
people
with
disability
,
who
it
state
be
probably
the
most
badly
affect
by
be
in
a
institution
.
to
all
who
pass
through
this
mother
and
baby
home
I
must
say
this
evening
that
the
unrelenting
darkness
through
which
they
have
live
,
the
shadow
cast
over
they
,
the
lack
of
information
and
the
lack
of
acknowledgement
be
something
we
want
to
end
.
I
be
conscious
that
it
be
disappointing
that
the
report
do
not
answer
all
the
deeply
personal
question
about
burial
arrangement
for
many
of
the
child
who
die
in
this
institution
and
in
many
case
the
burial
location
remain
unknown
.
it
be
my
deep
regret
that
we
cannot
provide
all
the
information
need
.
the
commission
find
that
many
adopt
people
think
there
be
considerably
more
information
about
they
in
institutional
and
other
record
than
be
the
case
.
have
examine
the
record
closely
,
the
commission
state
that
the
information
be
very
limited
in
most
case
.
there
be
no
burial
record
for
a
number
of
large
institution
,
where
significant
number
of
infant
be
know
to
have
die
,
include
at
Tuam
,
Bessborough
,
Castlepollard
and
Sean
Ross
Abbey
.
it
break
my
heart
that
this
information
be
not
there
and
it
be
another
fail
on
the
part
of
the
institution
to
do
the
right
thing
and
document
the
decision
make
to
allow
people
to
know
who
they
be
and
who
be
they
mother
and
sibling
.
we
be
aware
that
this
do
not
come
close
to
heal
the
pain
of
that
involve
but
the
government
be
commit
to
create
a
dignified
remembrance
and
memorialisation
where
there
be
currently
nothing
in
place
.
as
a
government
,
we
be
fully
commit
to
legislate
for
people
's
rights
to
access
information
that
be
there
.
a
person
's
right
to
identity
be
a
important
human
right
.
Medical
information
and
adoption
record
compile
at
the
time
of
adoption
should
be
make
available
,
and
the
minister
,
deputy
O'Gorman
,
be
work
intensively
with
the
Attorney
General
on
the
development
of
information
and
trace
legislation
to
support
a
person
's
right
to
access
birth
and
early
life
information
.
the
government
have
agree
to
make
this
a
priority
.
the
minister
be
also
work
with
the
Department
to
establish
a
restorative
recognition
scheme
for
survivor
,
which
will
involve
suggestion
from
survivor
that
will
make
a
real
and
measurable
difference
.
it
would
be
remiss
of
I
not
to
address
the
matter
of
Galway
County
Council
.
next
week
Galway
County
Council
have
its
monthly
plenary
meeting
and
I
be
horrified
to
think
no.
8
on
its
agenda
happen
to
be
statement
on
mother
and
baby
home
.
the
whole
county
council
meeting
should
be
give
over
to
apologise
to
that
who
be
in
that
mother
and
baby
home
.
we
have
hear
deputy
Connolly
's
contribution
and
both
of
we
be
from
Galway
and
we
understand
much
of
what
go
on
in
the
mother
and
baby
home
because
we
have
speak
with
the
affect
people
.
I
be
very
disappointed
to
learn
about
this
last
night
and
I
appeal
to
Galway
County
Council
to
amend
what
it
have
set
out
.
I
also
know
my
colleague
in
the
Seanad
,
Senator
O'Reilly
,
have
raise
the
matter
as
well
and
Galway
County
Council
should
follow
the
government
's
lead
in
apologise
if
it
want
to
bring
about
change
and
give
a
good
example
.

I
thank
the
Leas

Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
say
in
the
good
spirit
possible
that
it
be
not
the
first
time
that
have
happen
to
Pairtí

Lucht

I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
in
the
short
time
that
be
open
to
I
,
I
share
with
deputy
Mac
Lochlainn
a
interest
in
the
question
around
Rockall
.
it
would
be
good
to
have
some
clarity
on
that
.
that
be
my
first
question
.
as
I
only
have
four
and
a
half
minute
left
,
a
one
-
minute
answer
would
suffice
.
I
welcome
the
reply
.
I
look
forward
to
hear
about
progress
on
that
matter
.
the
minister
have
mention
the
idea
of
a
temporary
fleet
tie
-
up
scheme
in
the
context
of
the
€
1
billion
Brexit
adjustment
fund
.
be
he
give
consideration
to
a
decommissioning
scheme
,
and
if
so
,
will
he
include
the
small
vessel
that
would
have
be
exclude
which
be
under
the
18
m
threshold
in
such
a
scheme
?
we
want
to
ensure
,
if
such
a
scheme
be
be
consider
from
that
€
1
billion
,
that
small
boat
would
be
include
in
that
as
well
.
it
would
appear
from
the
minister
's
reply
that
he
have
not
give
consideration
to
the
idea
of
a
decommissioning
scheme
.
I
would
ask
,
frankly
,
because
it
be
important
for
we
to
be
honest
with
people
in
fishing
community
as
well
.
there
will
be
that
who
will
avail
of
a
decommissioning
scheme
if
it
be
appropriately
fund
.
it
be
something
that
should
be
put
on
the
table
.
it
be
important
for
we
to
be
honest
with
fishing
community
as
well
.
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
the
consequence
of
this
deal
and
the
loss
of
quota
will
have
a
impact
,
especially
on
small
inshore
vessel
.
let
we
be
honest
with
fisherman
about
that
.
I
would
ask
that
the
minister
give
I
a
clear
answer
in
respect
of
whether
he
will
consider
the
idea
of
a
decommissioning
scheme
,
specifically
in
favour
of
small
vessel
throughout
we
coastal
community
,
in
the
context
of
this
€
1
billion
fund
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
that
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
that
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
that
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
that
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
that
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
that
.
I
will
use
the
short
time
available
to
have
a
quick
back
-
and
-
forth
exchange
with
the
minister
.
in
respect
of
the
taxation
of
the
pup
,
the
paper
on
this
issue
by
the
Free
legal
advice
Centre
and
the
argument
make
in
it
be
very
compelling
.
it
be
important
for
we
to
pursue
the
point
in
regard
to
taxation
that
be
apply
retrospectively
.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
social
Welfare
(
Covid
-
19
)
(
amendment
)
act
2020
last
August
,
claimant
could
only
be
expect
to
have
rely
on
the
official
information
publish
by
the
Department
of
social
Protection
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
the
pup
would
be
subject
to
tax
.
however
,
neither
the
application
form
for
the
pup
nor
the
relevant
web
page
on
gov.ie
offer
any
guidance
in
this
regard
.
there
appear
to
be
inconsistency
between
the
official
statement
release
by
the
Department
and
the
political
statement
release
by
the
minister
for
Finance
regard
the
original
legal
basis
of
the
pup
and
the
implication
it
have
for
the
potential
taxation
of
the
payment
.
in
May
2020
,
the
pup
be
describe
as
a
social
welfare
payment
that
be
taxable
as
income
.
that
be
in
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
to
the
Minister
for
Finance
.
in
August
2020
,
however
,
the
pup
be
categorise
as
a
social
assistance
payment
.
such
payment
be
not
normally
subject
to
tax
.
the
original
Covid
PUP
scheme
be
describe
as
have
be
pay
pursuant
to
section
202
of
the
social
Welfare
Consolidation
Act
.
I
foresee
that
this
will
,
potentially
and
ultimately
,
become
a
matter
for
the
court
.
the
minister
state
that
the
taxation
of
the
payment
be
constitutional
but
the
issue
of
fairness
apply
in
the
question
of
whether
anybody
who
make
the
application
for
pup
could
reasonably
have
expect
,
when
he
or
she
apply
for
it
,
that
it
would
be
tax
.
I
know
the
minister
will
come
back
to
I
on
that
.
the
second
point
I
would
like
to
make
relate
to
person
who
have
contact
we
office
in
respect
of
love
one
who
have
pass
away
.
there
be
,
within
the
system
,
many
section
of
the
Department
and
the
Department
of
Heath
that
people
have
to
go
through
to
put
in
order
the
affair
of
person
who
have
receive
payment
,
in
term
of
notification
and
whatnot
.
I
ask
that
the
minister
sit
down
with
she
official
with
a
view
to
create
a
one
-
stop
shop
for
bereaved
person
in
order
that
when
they
love
one
pass
away
,
there
be
as
seamless
a
process
as
possible
.
if
there
be
a
one
-
stop
shop
,
it
would
help
many
grieve
family
,
particularly
at
this
point
in
time
when
many
people
be
lose
love
one
.
I
acknowledge
the
sympathetic
and
empathetic
manner
in
which
social
welfare
official
deal
with
people
in
that
situation
.
in
my
experience
,
the
engagement
have
be
extremely
positive
and
I
want
to
acknowledge
the
official
's
role
.
my
third
point
be
in
regard
to
community
employment
,
CE
,
scheme
.
I
welcome
the
statement
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Joe
O'Brien
,
in
respect
of
the
extension
of
the
timeframe
.
what
consideration
be
be
give
to
CE
supervisor
's
pension
request
?
where
stand
that
process
at
the
moment
?
I
understand
from
the
minister
's
predecessor
that
there
be
a
legitimate
expectation
on
the
part
of
CE
supervisor
that
there
would
be
a
protocol
or
something
put
in
place
that
would
acknowledge
they
role
and
provide
for
pension
entitlement
or
some
sort
of
acknowledgment
of
the
work
they
have
do
,
many
of
they
over
decade
.
I
ask
the
minister
or
Minister
of
State
to
indicate
whether
or
not
there
be
a
realistic
expectation
on
the
part
of
CE
supervisor
that
they
will
receive
a
pension
or
some
sort
of
payment
for
the
exceptional
work
they
have
do
in
we
community
.
we
would
all
support
such
a
proposal
if
it
be
to
bear
fruit
as
soon
as
possible
.
the
deputy
be
right
,
however
,
and
I
will
agree
with
she
on
this
,
that
it
be
a
matter
of
all
of
we
follow
the
good
advice
.
that
be
how
we
will
stop
the
spread
of
the
virus
.
it
be
not
a
blame
game
but
a
matter
of
all
of
we
adhere
to
the
advice
and
the
guidance
as
good
we
possibly
can
.
I
support
Sinn
Féin
's
motion
.
we
strongly
believe
that
the
issue
of
fuel
poverty
and
the
current
fuel
allowance
system
require
further
interrogation
.
the
Labour
Party
have
carry
out
a
analysis
of
this
year
's
fuel
allowance
payment
arise
from
budget
2021
and
I
would
welcome
the
minister
's
response
to
that
analysis
,
if
she
can
respond
to
it
.
it
be
we
contention
that
in
real
term
there
have
be
,
in
effect
,
a
cut
to
the
fuel
allowance
for
2020
-
21
.
the
reason
we
be
say
that
be
because
the
fuel
allowance
be
pay
over
28
week
from
the
end
of
September
through
to
March
.
due
to
Covid
-
19
,
the
2019
-
20
fuel
allowance
season
be
extend
by
a
extra
four
week
.
this
would
have
be
worth
€
98
to
recipient
,
because
four
week
multiply
by
€
24.50
be
€
98
.
in
2021
,
the
payment
increase
by
€
3.50
a
week
from
January
,
which
would
be
worth
a
additional
€
98
over
a
full
28
week
.
however
,
only
14
of
the
week
in
this
year
's
fuel
season
will
be
pay
at
the
high
rate
,
which
mean
they
will
only
get
€
49
.
that
signal
,
in
real
term
,
a
actual
cut
in
the
fuel
allowance
.
that
be
the
Labour
Party
analysis
.
I
would
welcome
a
response
from
the
minister
in
respect
of
that
analysis
because
if
she
agree
with
it
,
and
I
mean
this
respectfully
,
that
would
blow
the
government
's
argument
regard
the
policy
roll
-
out
on
the
fuel
allowance
for
2021
out
of
the
water
.
it
effectively
mean
that
people
on
fuel
allowance
this
winter
will
be
down
€
49
compare
with
the
2019
-
20
season
,
and
next
winter
they
will
also
face
more
expensive
fuel
due
to
the
high
carbon
tax
.
we
be
on
record
as
say
we
be
not
against
the
carbon
tax
but
it
mean
people
will
be
bad
off
in
2021
.
the
government
will
say
that
there
be
no
carbon
tax
increase
by
€
7.50
per
tonne
until
May
,
but
thereafter
that
will
hit
.
the
minister
also
say
it
be
for
individual
to
seek
supplementary
welfare
allowance
and
that
community
welfare
officer
will
not
be
find
want
when
it
come
to
exceptional
need
payment
.
that
have
be
my
experience
in
my
constituency
.
the
system
that
be
set
up
to
allow
for
payment
for
exceptional
need
have
,
in
my
experience
,
continue
to
be
a
robust
one
and
that
level
of
discretion
be
,
thankfully
,
there
.
we
welcome
that
.
however
,
the
figure
show
that
,
in
spite
of
the
minister
's
contention
that
supplementary
welfare
allowance
can
be
pay
and
be
available
in
exceptional
circumstance
,
between
January
and
December
only
11,922
people
receive
the
fuel
supplement
or
the
heat
supplement
.
in
the
context
of
the
overall
spend
and
the
number
that
be
in
receipt
of
fuel
allowance
,
one
would
have
to
contend
that
11,922
be
quite
a
small
number
of
people
to
have
benefit
from
that
additional
payment
.
that
speak
volume
about
the
continue
level
of
fuel
poverty
that
exist
within
this
State
.
I
do
not
doubt
the
minister
's
bona
fide
.
when
we
be
argue
this
point
in
opposition
,
we
all
subscribe
to
rhetoric
.
there
be
no
question
about
that
.
there
be
scope
to
look
at
the
fuel
allowance
again
,
perhaps
to
look
at
the
Labour
Party
analysis
of
the
real
-
term
impact
of
the
cut
,
and
see
whether
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
could
be
examine
afresh
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
more
people
be
notify
and
make
aware
of
its
existence
.
the
11,922
people
who
avail
of
the
payment
in
December
and
January
be
a
small
number
relative
to
the
300000
plus
in
receipt
of
the
payment
.
that
be
we
core
point
.
I
want
to
speak
to
the
element
of
the
motion
that
deal
with
the
pup
,
and
it
not
be
a
qualifying
payment
for
the
fuel
allowance
.
we
be
see
a
grow
phenomenon
in
we
constituency
office
of
people
who
be
feel
the
effect
of
long
Covid
.
I
appreciate
that
the
science
in
regard
to
measure
the
effect
of
long
Covid
might
not
be
up
-
to
-
date
but
the
phenomenon
of
long
Covid
and
its
effect
on
people
be
widely
accept
.
there
be
a
sufficient
evidence
base
in
that
regard
.
the
enhance
illness
benefit
be
the
current
payment
that
meet
the
need
of
that
people
,
as
I
understand
it
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
undertake
a
budgetary
analysis
of
people
who
be
suffer
the
effect
of
long
Covid
and
to
design
a
payment
that
would
include
provision
for
a
fuel
allowance
to
meet
the
need
of
household
with
people
who
have
be
work
but
be
no
long
able
to
work
because
of
the
long
-
term
physical
effect
of
Covid
.
that
would
be
a
stringent
exercise
.
I
merely
want
to
it
put
on
the
record
of
the
Dáil
today
in
relation
to
the
minister
's
agenda
.
I
be
ask
she
to
look
afresh
at
measure
the
long
-
term
impact
of
long
Covid
and
to
examine
if
additional
support
can
be
put
into
that
budgetary
line
,
include
a
potential
provision
for
fuel
allowance
payment
where
there
be
a
fuel
poverty
marker
in
a
give
household
.
I
accept
the
point
make
by
deputy
Bruton
but
the
people
I
be
meet
be
not
in
a
position
to
be
able
to
avail
of
the
support
that
have
be
articulate
by
he
.
whatever
about
local
authority
programme
and
the
progress
in
that
regard
,
which
I
acknowledge
,
the
people
who
have
avail
of
Sustainable
Energy
Authority
of
Ireland
grant
in
respect
of
the
extensive
work
that
need
to
be
carry
out
on
the
housing
stock
be
people
who
do
not
have
the
means
and
cannot
access
loan
to
bring
they
house
up
to
the
require
standard
such
that
fuel
poverty
be
extinguish
.
there
be
still
a
significant
gap
in
the
housing
stock
that
be
plug
,
by
and
large
,
by
the
fuel
allowance
.
I
understand
and
acknowledge
that
progress
be
be
make
but
it
need
to
be
accelerate
.
while
that
acceleration
of
enhancement
of
building
and
housing
stock
be
under
way
,
eligibility
for
the
fuel
allowance
should
be
look
at
again
,
if
at
all
possible
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
number
of
people
in
receipt
of
the
fuel
allowance
be
significant
,
but
if
it
could
be
look
at
afresh
,
particularly
in
regard
to
that
people
in
fuel
impoverish
house
,
that
would
be
widely
welcome
.
I
welcome
the
reappointment
of
Dr.
Niall
Muldoon
.
he
have
do
a
stellar
job
on
behalf
of
child
throughout
the
State
and
I
be
glad
he
be
be
reappoint
.
I
acknowledge
Dr.
Muldoon
's
report
in
respect
of
unmet
need
in
the
assessment
of
need
for
child
.
we
note
that
the
figure
have
not
improve
significantly
since
the
issuance
of
that
report
.
I
further
acknowledge
that
minister
be
do
they
good
to
create
the
right
environment
for
assessment
of
need
to
be
conduct
in
a
timely
fashion
,
but
they
will
be
conscious
that
there
have
be
much
commentary
about
the
number
of
child
who
still
require
a
assessment
of
need
and
that
the
desktop
exercise
,
or
90
-
minute
assessment
,
be
open
to
legitimate
critique
.
Dr.
Niall
Muldoon
have
state
that
there
need
to
be
a
dramatic
increase
in
resource
such
that
proper
assessment
can
be
carry
out
and
the
requisite
service
would
follow
every
child
.
we
welcome
the
reappointment
of
the
Ombudsman
for
Children
.
we
believe
that
he
have
be
a
stout
advocate
on
behalf
of
child
and
calm
in
he
delivery
of
key
message
.
it
be
a
source
of
great
comfort
to
parent
and
family
that
there
be
in
this
office
somebody
like
Dr.
Niall
Muldoon
who
speak
truth
to
power
.
he
have
call
out
the
fact
that
the
statutory
timeframe
for
completion
of
assessment
of
need
be
not
be
meet
.
I
be
aware
that
this
a
matter
the
government
be
seek
to
address
.
if
we
be
to
have
ombudsperson
in
this
State
,
it
be
only
fair
that
when
they
issue
report
,
we
respond
in
a
timely
fashion
to
what
they
be
say
in
they
report
.
Dr.
Muldoon
have
say
that
there
be
need
for
a
tenfold
increase
in
resource
.
we
be
not
see
any
evidence
of
that
yet
.
notwithstanding
that
additional
money
be
make
available
by
the
then
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Health
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
in
respect
of
assessment
of
need
,
there
be
still
a
job
of
work
to
be
do
within
individual
HSE
community
healthcare
organisation
,
CHO
,
area
,
where
there
be
still
massive
variation
in
term
of
meet
the
need
of
child
.
ultimately
,
this
be
about
child
.
we
can
not
skimp
when
it
come
to
child
.
we
all
welcome
the
reappointment
of
Dr.
Muldoon
.
all
of
we
throughout
the
political
system
have
great
faith
in
he
.
I
join
in
wish
he
well
in
the
next
part
of
he
tenure
and
I
look
forward
to
he
work
with
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
and
,
in
particular
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Children
,
Disability
,
Equality
and
Integration
,
in
respect
of
he
ongoing
work
and
advocacy
on
behalf
of
the
child
of
this
State
.
deputy
Cahill
be
unable
to
attend
,
but
he
be
down
to
share
time
with
I
.
I
have
to
respond
to
some
of
the
extraordinary
word
that
be
utter
not
by
the
previous
Sinn
Féin
speaker
but
the
one
before
.
the
deputy
come
in
and
lecture
Fianna
Fáil
and
Fine
Gael
on
they
role
in
the
economic
crisis
,
bank
guarantee
and
bank
bailout
.
there
be
all
sort
of
anti-European
utterance
about
we
role
in
the
European
Union
.
I
wish
to
outline
to
the
deputy
that
when
I
be
a
child
in
primary
school
,
Sinn
Féin
Deputy
be
in
the
dáil
praise
the
bank
guarantee
.
multiple
Sinn
Féin
Deputy
be
in
the
Dáil
Chamber
,
include
Caoimhghín
Ó
Caoláin
,
Arthur
Morgan
-
as
well
as
deputy
Pearse
Doherty
,
while
he
be
in
the
Seanad
-
give
support
to
the
credit
guarantee
when
it
be
be
outline
and
to
the
early
stage
of
the
bail
out
.
the
misinformation
that
be
outline
by
deputy
Gould
when
he
be
in
the
Chamber
some
moment
ago
be
extraordinary
.
I
believe
he
owe
the
House
a
more
honest
account
of
the
role
of
Sinn
Féin
.
I
will
move
on
now
to
speak
not
about
constituency
issue
or
anything
else
but
about
the
matter
at
hand
in
the
Dáil
,
which
be
the
criminal
justice
(
theft
and
Fraud
offence
)
(
amendment
)
Bill
2020
.
the
government
be
work
on
significant
legislation
in
term
of
we
role
to
protect
ourselves
from
fraud
at
European
level
.
we
should
acknowledge
the
fact
that
fraud
be
estimate
to
cost
€
500
million
worth
of
European
money
.
obviously
,
that
be
a
staggering
amount
of
money
and
we
should
do
more
on
a
multilateral
basis
to
deal
with
that
.
it
require
high
level
of
co-operation
from
we
government
and
across
all
European
level
to
police
this
matter
.
it
be
a
extraordinarily
large
amount
of
money
that
could
be
put
to
exceptionally
good
use
in
other
area
.
it
could
be
use
to
prevent
crime
,
for
example
,
or
to
help
we
to
upgrade
and
invest
in
cybersecurity
,
as
outline
by
the
previous
speaker
.
that
be
a
exceptionally
important
point
.
I
believe
we
ability
to
protect
ourselves
from
cybercrime
be
a
area
where
we
be
exceptionally
vulnerable
in
Ireland
.
we
be
a
prominent
nation
in
term
of
international
finance
and
banking
.
we
need
look
no
further
than
outside
the
door
today
at
the
company
and
multinational
that
surround
we
at
the
Convention
Centre
.
from
my
engagement
with
people
in
this
sector
as
a
member
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Transport
and
Communication
Network
it
be
clear
that
strong
view
be
be
put
forward
by
many
people
in
that
sector
.
they
be
concerned
about
the
ability
of
the
government
to
defend
the
sector
from
cyberattack
.
unfortunately
,
this
can
be
serious
in
the
impact
it
can
have
on
the
public
finances
and
potential
theft
.
we
should
strengthen
we
ability
to
police
against
that
.
this
have
be
outline
by
multiple
deputy
in
the
House
today
.
I
wish
to
put
this
point
across
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Browne
,
today
while
he
be
with
we
,
because
I
know
this
matter
fall
within
he
Department
.
it
relate
to
how
we
police
fraud
and
theft
in
Ireland
.
fraud
and
theft
be
obviously
issue
we
have
have
down
through
the
year
.
this
have
be
experience
through
multiple
government
and
we
have
to
do
more
.
I
would
like
to
see
Ireland
rise
in
the
index
in
term
of
we
transparency
,
which
be
obviously
important
.
as
a
new
person
get
involved
in
politics
,
I
often
sense
among
the
public
a
great
mistrust
of

,
of
what
they
stand
for
or
of
what
they
be

to
achieve
by

into
politics
.
this
apply
whether
it
be
deliver
for
constituency
or
work
on
policy
issue
that
affect
everyone
in
the
State
.
this
be
a
area
where
member
of
the
public
want
to
see
we
lead
from
the
front
.
they
want
to
see
a
more
honest
and
transparent
political
system
.
we
ever
-
grow
role
within
the
European
Union
be
obviously
become
more
important
.
it
be
grow
each
year
in
term
of
the
integration
between
nation
across
the
European
Union
.
this
be
timely
legislation
.
it
be
time
we
put
we

it

it
be
grow

in

this
be
timely
legislation
.
it
be
time
we
put
we
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
enact
it
.
it
be
very
interesting
to
listen
to
we
friend
from
Limerick
and
we
friend
from
Kerry
speak
about
the
Labour
Party
motion
.
they
remind
I
of
the
missionary
priest
who
use
to
come
to
Mallow
when
I
be
a
boy
in
the
1980
.
that
priest
would
preach
fire
,
damnation
and
brimstone
and
engage
in
fine
rhetoric
.
I
be
not
sure
the
Deputy
's
rhetoric
be
so
fine
but
there
be
plenty
of
it
.
however
,
there
be
very
little
enlightenment
at
the
end
of
it
all
and
I
often
wonder
if
it
be
more
about
spectacle
than
substance
.
none
of
the
Deputy
to
whom
I
refer
have
spend
a
day
in
government
and
they
never
will
because
they
would
run
a
mile
from
it
.
I
doubt
any
one
of
they
would
have
the
backbone
or
the
courage
to
go
into
government
or
to
spend
one
day
inside
Government
Buildings
.
I
think
the
Healy
-
Raes
be
in
there
for
a
little
while
all
right
but
they
run
out
as
quick
as
lightning
.
it
be
fine
to
preach
when
in
opposition
.
it
be
the
easy
thing
to
play
the
Tadgh
a
dá
thaobh
,
and
God
know
there
be
plenty
of
people
in
this
place
who
want
to
be
Tadgh
a
dá
thaobh
.
the
Labour
Party
motion
be
honest
.
what
we
be
seek
to
do
be
to
bring
about
a
perspective
which
seek
to
provide
some
enlightenment
on
this
issue
that
exercise
we
all
.
I
want
to
focus
very
briefly
on
the
issue
of
long
Covid
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
take
on
board
the
fact
there
be
people
now
suffer
the
effect
of
long
Covid
.
it
be
a
expression
that
have
work
its
way
into
the
public
discourse
and
we
be
see
its
effect
.
however
,
it
have
not
be
classify
officially
.
I
ask
the
minister
and
the
government
to
put
in
place
a
pot
of
funding
so
that
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
the
Health
Research
Board
and
the
Department
can
take
a
collective
approach
to
look
at
the
effect
of
long
Covid
.
we
be
now
see
the
effect
of
this
in
term
of
the
presentation
of
other
type
of
illness
as
a
result
of
people
have
contract
Covid
.
the
only
research
I
can
speak
to
in
a
Irish
context
that
exist
at

quite
a
length
of
time
after
have
receive

all
I
be
ask
be
that
the
government
adopt
a
cross-
departmental
approach
,
bring
in
the
research
funder
and
start
issue
funding
call
so
that
we
excellent
scientist
work
in
health
can
start
research
this
.
if
there
be
a
evidence
base
for
it
,
we
can
then
acknowledge
that
the
Department
of
social
Protection
could
put
in
place
a
payment
which
recognise
the
long
-
term
impact
on
people
of
Covid
,
something
akin
to
the
enhance
illness
benefit
payment
that
recognise
long
Covid
.
long
after
have
receive
a
diagnosis
of
Covid
people
feel
the
ill
effect
of
it
.
they
be
miss
work
.
there
be
the
issue
of
fatigue
and
also
issue
relate
to
the
impact
on
people
's
heart
and
lung
.
as
a
society
,
we
need
to
acknowledge
this
issue
and
address
it
.
if
we
have
a
evidence
base
with
well
-
fund
research
,
we
can
take
that
research
and
turn
it
into
a
acknowledgement
,
through
the
Department
of
social
Protection
and
the
Minister
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
of
the
need
to
establish
payment
for
that
people
where
they
be
miss
work
and
require
a
supplementary
income
to
acknowledge
the
suffering
they
be
go
through
at
present
.
this
be
the
call
the
Labour
Party
be
make
through
the
motion
and
I
ask
that
the
minister
use
he
good
office
.
I
know
he
be
a
research
-
minded
minister
and
if
we
call
on
the
minister
to
do
this
we
would
be
do
a
good
day
's
work
to
acknowledge
that
people
suffer
from
long
Covid

I
move
:
that
leave
be
grant
to
introduce
a
Bill
entitle
a
act
to
give
security
to
local
authority
,
by
way
of
create
a
charge
on
the
land
concerned
,
in
relation
to
the
expense
incur
by
the
local
authority
in
order
to
give
effect
to
measure
which
the
local
authority
consider
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
the
land
from
become
or
continue
to
be
a
derelict
site
,
for
that
purpose
to
amend
the
Derelict
Sites
Act
1990
,
and
to
provide
for
related
matter
.
I
seek
leave
to
introduce
the
Derelict
site
(
amendment
)
Bill
2021
.
the
Derelict
Sites
Act
1990
enable
a
local
authority
,
where
,
in
its
opinion
,
it
be
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
prevent
land
from
become
or
continue
to
be
a
derelict
site
,
to
serve
a
notice
in
writing
on
the
owner
or
occupier
of
the
land
.
under
section
11
of
the
act
,
where
the
person
on
whom
the
notice
have
be
serve
do
not
comply
with
it
within
a
specify
period
,
the
local
authority
may
take
such
step
,
include
entry
on
land
by
authorise
person
,
as
it
consider
reasonable
and
necessary
to
give
effect
to
the
term
of
the
notice
.
the
authority
may
also
recover
any
expense
incur
from
the
person
on
whom
the
notice
be
serve
as
a
simple
contract
debt
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
.
if
,
however
,
the
derelict
site
belong
to
a
insolvent
company
and
a
liquidator
be
appoint
who
sell
the
land
,
the
proceed
of
the
sale
must
be
distribute
accord
to
the
rule
relate
to
priority
of
debt
.
secure
creditor
come
first
and
unsecured
creditor
be
at
the
end
of
queue
.
at
the
end
of
the
process
there
may
be
nothing
leave
to
pay
unsecured
creditor
,
include
the
local
authority
.
the
Bill
propose
a
short
amendment
to
the
act
so
as
to
convert
the
expense
incur
by
the
local
authority
into
a
charge
on
the
land
,
make
the
authority
a
secure
creditor
for
the
purpose
of
a
subsequent
liquidation
.
the
main
reason
I
be
introduce
this
legislation
be
that
in
my
own
home
town
of
Mallow
we
have
a
derelict
site
,
the
former
Central
Hotel
,
which
give
rise
to
litigation
in
2012
.
a
fire
at
the
hotel
,
where
there
be
continue
dereliction
,
give
rise
to
a
court
sitting
.
in
a
article
in
the
Corkman
newspaper
,
Mr.
Bill
Browne
state
:
at
a
court
sit
in
October
2012
the
then
owner
...
be
hit
with
a
fine
of
€
91033.07
plus
legal
cost
under
the
dangerous
Structure
provision
of
the
1964
bill
.
this
total
also
include
recoup
cost
of
the
remedial
work
undertake
by
Mallow
Town
Council
.
it
be
understand
the
money
remain
outstanding
.
in
June
of
2016
two
separate
fire
at
the
dilapidated
building
within
the
space
of
three
hour
cause
even
more
internal
damage
to
the
building
.
the
follow
month
the
building
once
again
come
under
the
spotlight
after
it
emerge
a
Dublin
-
base
property
developer
have
purchase
it
for
a
sum
...
a
subsequent
application
for
a
major
plan
of
work
there
,
lodge
in
the
name
of
Mallow
Capital
Ltd
,
be
shoot
down
by
county
council
planner
.
in
the
case
of
the
Central
Hotel
in
Mallow
and
countless
number
of
derelict
site
throughout
the
country
,
the
fact
be
that
where
a
site
be
in
the
ownership
of
a
insolvent
company
and
the
local
authority
intervene
to
make
it
safe
,
the
taxpayer
lose
.
the
taxpayer
have
no
mechanism
to
recoup
that
funding
through
the
local
authority
make
the
site
safe
.
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
be
to
make
good
that
wrong
and
ensure
the
taxpayer
be
protect
such
that
,
where
a
local
authority
intervene
to
protect
citizen
in
a
streetscape
in
the
event
of
a
building
become
derelict
and
require
to
be
make
safe
,
the
authority
will
not
be
leave
at
a
loss
for
the
cost
of
do
so
.
we
be
seek
to
rectify
and
amend
the
Derelict
Sites
Act
1990
.
I
be
hopeful
the
government
will
support
this
Bill
and
that
it
will
receive
cross-party
support
because
this
issue
affect
each
and
every
one
of
we
in
we
constituency
.

"
will
the
minister
give
a
synopsis
of
where
stand
the
beef
task
force
at
present
?
we
be
all
receive
communication
from
the
Beef
Plan
Movement
where
there
be
a
clear
ask
for
the
appointment
of
a
independent
regulator
.
it
would
be
very
useful
for
we
if
the
minister
in
he
response
could
give
we
a
up
-
to
-
date
position
as
to
where
the
task
force
be
at
present
.
on
the
status
of
horticulture
,
Bord
to
Móna
have
make
a
decision
on
harvesting
peat
.
as
we
move
down
the
level
of
public
health
guideline
and
garden
centre
reopen
and
people
begin
to
purchase
compost
again
,
will
there
be
a
adequate
supply
of
compost
and
will
we
be
face
with
shortage
?
will
we
be
import
compost
as
a
consequence
of
decision
not
to
harvest
peat
,
as
articulate
by
Bord
to
Móna
?
I
ask
the
minister
for
he
perspective
on
where
stand
that
status
at
the
moment
.
we
all
agree
that
action
on
climate
change
be
necessary
.
if
it
mean
,
though
,
that
we
be
go
to
be
import
thing
like
coconut
derivative
from
third
country
,
then
the
question
will
be
ask
whether
in
real
term
that
be
real
action
on
climate
change
.
as
people
begin
to
visit
they
garden
centre
again
,
they
will
be
wonder
whether
there
will
be
a
adequate
supply
of
compost
for
the
come
grow
season
.
on
the
status
of
point
-
to
-
point
racing
,
we
know
several
meeting
throughout
the
country
have
be
cancel
.
I
cannot
figure
out
the
logic
of
allow
racing
to
go
ahead
because
of
the
importance
of
the
racing
and
bloodstock
industry
,
as
the
minister
say
,
but
then
disallow
point
-
to
-
point
race
meeting
.
I
would
have
think
that
this
two
endeavour
be
complementary
and
dovetail
with
each
other
.
if
we
can
justify
hold
race
meeting
,
then
we
can
surely
justify
hold
point
-
to
-
point
meeting
.
I
be
a
Cork
person
and
I
live
in
Mallow
.
there
be
a
racecourse
there
and
I
recognise
the
importance
of
that
aspect
of
the
industry
.
I
would
like
also
to
speak
,
however
,
for
the
people
who
operate
point
-
to
-
point
racing
.
that
meeting
will
begin
to
start
from
March
.
they
be
not
technically
cancel
.
I
be
talk
about
place
like
Kildorrery
,
Dromahane
and
other
which
be
vital
to
the
local
economy
.
I
would
like
a
update
on
the
status
of
that
meeting
.
my
last
issue
be
one
on
which
I
do
not
necessarily
expect
the
minister
to
have
a
response
.
a
young
woman
be
be
detain
by
the
Indian
police
.
please
forgive
I
if
I
mispronounce
she
name
,
but
Disha
Ravi
be
a
young
environmental
activist
protest
on
behalf
of
Indian
subsistence
farmer
.
we
have
a
long
history
of
protest
regard
farming
issue
in
this
country
.
it
be
inherent
within
the
Irish
polity
and
psyche
to
protest
or
advocate
on
behalf
of
farming
interest
or
to
do
both
.
I
acknowledge
Ms
Ravi
's
activism
and
hope
the
Irish
government
will
,
if
possible
,
make
its
view
know
or
register
its
disturbance
at
the
fact
that
this
young
activist
have
be
detain
purely
and
only
on
the
basis
of
she
activism
on
behalf
of
environmental
issue
and
to
support
subsistence
farmer
in
India
.
I
put
on
the
record
of
the
House
that
Ms
Ravi
be
a
activist
and
that
she
be
be
detain
.
I
hope
the
Irish
government
will
record
its
protest
with
the
Indian
government
regard
this
situation
.
I
will
move
the
adjournment
.
I
hope
we
can
mobilise

''
I
support
the
motion
.
we
welcome
the
motion
and
the
fact
that
the
government
be
not
oppose
it
,
nor
the
propose
amendment
,
I
assume
,
and
the
Labour
Party
proposal
to
extend
access
to
the
medical
card
to
applicant
.
I
will
speak
on
that
momentarily
,
but
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
government
be
not
oppose
it
.
the
issue
of
the
status
of
the
motion
then
arise
.
the
motion
seek
to
extend
the
life
of
the
commission
.
if
the
government
be
not
oppose
it
,
do
it
follow
that
the
life
of
the
commission
will
be
extend
?
I
do
not
believe
that
be
the
case
because
the
minister
's
remark
thus
far
suggest
otherwise
.
I
wish
to
speak
on
the
issue
of
datum
protection
because
there
be
some
element
of
this
that
be
unclear
in
my
mind
.
on
11
February
,
the
minister
write
to
the
clerk
of
the
Joint
Committee
on
Children
,
Disability
,
Equality
and
Integration
.
I
be
a
member
of
that
committee
.
the
minister
quote
from
the
commission
's
final
report
with
regard
to
the
conduct
of
the
confidential
committee
.
he
say
that
witness
be
ask
for
permission
to
record
they
evidence
on
the
clear
understanding
that
the
recording
would
be
use
only
as
a
aide
-
memoire
,
and
that
all
such
recording
be
destroy
after
the
report
be
add
to
the
confidential
committee
electronic
repository
of
information
.
if
we
fast
forward
to
today
,
we
now
know
that
the
information
be
available
.
it
have
be
retrieve
,
and
that
be
a
fact
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
minister
will
become
the
datum
controller
for
that
information
.
however
,
there
be
something
I
can
not
reconcile
in
my
mind
.
if
it
be
the
understanding
of
the
confidential
committee
testimony
taker
,
evidence
taker
or
whatever
expression
one
wish
to
use
and
of
the
commission
that
the
evidence
would
be
destroy
,
if
the
minister
be
co-ordinate
with
the
DPC
and
if
the
Murphy
commission
be
say
that
it
be
hand
over
to
the
minister
datum
which
it
have
already
process
and
if
that
information
be
use
for
a
specific
purpose
-
I
use
the
expression
"
specific
purpose
"
because
it
have
a
legal
meaning
for
the
purpose
of
the
commission
's
work
-
what
be
the
status
of
that
datum
if
the
minister
become
the
controller
of
the
datum
and
if
the
DPC
report
that
it
be
use
once
for
a
specific
purpose
and
that
it
be
understand
that
it
would
be
destroy
?
now
the
minister
will
become
the
controller
of
that
datum
and
it
can
be
use
again
for
subject
access
request
.
that
be
the
question
.
I
apologise
if
I
do
not
fully
understand
the
process
,
but
if
the
DPC
decide
that
it
be
already
use
for
a
specific
purpose
,
do
it
then
follow
that
it
must
be
destroy
under
the
term
of
reference
of
the
commission
as
already
articulate
by
the
minister
to
the
committee
?
that
be
the
question
on
we
mind
.
this
issue
would
not
have
arise
if
people
feel
they
narrative
,
story
and
history
be
adequately
and
properly
reflect
in
the
report
.
so
great
be
the
damage
do
by
inaccurately
reflect
the
trauma
of
people
that
we
have
now
reach
the
point
where
this
House
be
call
for
a
extension
to
the
commission
's
remit
to
deal
with
the
matter
.
someone
somewhere
make
a
hame
of
this
and
the
buck
now
stop
with
the
minister
.
short
of
the
commission
be
reconstitute
,
the
responsibility
on
he
be
to
create
a
process
that
will
give
justice
to
and
correct
the
narrative
of
that
who
feel
rightly
aggrieve
by
the
fact
that
they
story
be
not
adequately
reflect
in
the
final
report
.
a
great
injury
have
be
do
to
they
.
the
minister
state
:
the
commission
state
that
consent
be
give
by
549
of
the
550
witness
to
the
use
of
a
audio
device
and
the
subsequent
deletion
of
the
recording
.
for
clarity
,
the
final
witness
,
who
object
to
they
testimony
be
record
,
be
not
record
.
I
be
fascinate
by
that
statement
.
do
it
not
make
liar
of
the
many
people
who
feel
they
be
never
tell
that
all
of
this
be
be
record
?
we
need
to
delve
into
that
further
because
the
question
of
consent
have
become
a
major
issue
.
there
be
people
who
in
they
mind
rightly
feel
they
do
not
give
such
a
consent
.
how
do
we
reconcile
that
and
why
be
it
not
reflect
in
the
minister
's
speech
?
as
I
say
at
the
recent
committee
hearing
,
and
will
continue
to
say
,
in
the
absence
of
the
reconstitution
of
the
commission
,
a
mechanism
must
be
find
to
ensure
the
narrative
be
correct
so
that
people
can
get
some
restitution
of
justice
for
they
time
and
the
pain
they
go
through
when
they
be
tell
they
story
.
if
the
minister
do
not
do
that
,
I
respectfully
say
that
any
other
legislation
or
issue
related
to
redress
will
be
taint
because
how
will
any
survivor
be
able
to
trust
or
buy
into
any
process
until
the
matter
of
narrative
have
be
adequately
address
?
I
ask
the
minister
to
take
that
on
board
.
if
he
do
so
and
deal
with
the
matter
full
on
,
he
will
go
a
long
way
towards
repair
the
damage
that
be
do
by
the
use
of
the
cold
language
,
to
use
he
expression
,
that
be
in
this
report
.
the
minister
must
deal
with
the
issue
of
medical
card
.
the
inclusion
of
a
criterion
that
people
must
have
spend
six
month
in
a
home
be
cruel
.
I
be
sure
minister
will
look
at
this
again
.
Professor
Louise
Kenny
,
a
eminent
person
,
produce
a
report
base
on
she
examination
of
the
death
certificate
of
all
816
baby
who
die
in
the
Bessborough
mother
and
baby
home
.
extrapolate
from
the
evidence
adduce
from
this
death
certificate
,
it
be
possible
to
draw
up
a
list
of
condition
-
gynaecological
-
related
issue
-
affect
that
who
give
birth
and
be
still
alive
.
there
be
enough
evidence
for
medical
card
to
be
issue
forthwith
.
the
criterion
should
be
that
if
one
go
in
at
35
week
,
36
week
or
whatever
,
that
be
the
starting
period
.
if
one
spend
any
period
in
the
-----
it
be
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
population
be
become
traumatise
by
the
continue
effect
of
Covid
-
19
.
this
be
the
last
time
we
should
ask
the
Irish
people
to
continue
with
level
5
restriction
,
albeit
soften
they
slowly
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
significant
mental
stress
have
result
for
many
in
the
population
.
this
have
be
particularly
so
for
the
education
sector
,
especially
special
education
and
the
many
teacher
,
carer
,
parent
and
pupil
.
the
late
announcement
regard
the
return
to
school
be
welcome
,
especially
for
leave
certificate
student
,
early
year
education
and
that
in
special
education
.
like
many
other
,
I
welcome
the
re-prioritisation
of
vulnerable
and
immunosuppressed
people
in
the
vaccination
schedule
.
I
believe
the
government
will
also
have
to
consider
some
cohort
in
the
carer
sector
for
priority
vaccination
,
give
the
exceptional
difficulty
that
could
occur
for
a
vulnerable
person
if
the
person
's
carer
become
indispose
due
to
Covid
-
19
.
however
,
even
as
the
government
commit
to
schooling
and
vaccination
,
there
be
very
little
in
the
plan
for
the
private
business
sector
or
for
that
who
depend
on
the
hospitality
and
tourism
sector
for
they
livelihood
.
we
all
understand
that
transmission
of
the
virus
be
the
arbiter
of
open
up
the
economy
but
significant
question
remain
for
I
and
many
other
.
what
be
the
overall
action
plan
,
aside
from
wait
on
sufficient
vaccine
supply
,
to
prise
ourselves
out
of
this
situation
?
the
vaccine
strategy
be
fraught
with
danger
on
two
level
in
particular
.
one
be
that
we
may
not
secure
appropriate
supplies
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
.
for
all
the
time
that
we
depend
solely
on
a
vaccine
fix
,
we
risk
a
new
variant
of
Covid
come
into
the
country
and
undo
all
the
hard
work
the
population
have
do
to
date
.
we
have
see
how
the
British
variant
have
become
the
dominant
strain
in
less
than
12
week
,
and
the
Brazilian
variant
have
be
identify
in
the
North
of
Ireland
.
how
can
we
protect
we
future
,
hard
-
win
gain
if
we
cannot
protect
we
border
and
the
movement
of
people
throughout
we
country
?
we
have
have
month
to
consider
border
restriction
and
full
quarantine
,
yet
we
face
wait
for
week
for
legislation
to
be
draft
.
this
can
hardly
be
deem
to
be
acceptable
.
along
with
the
furlough
economy
,
there
be
now
a
tsunami
of
defer
activity
in
the
hospital
sector
,
with
waiting
list
double
from
the
position
12
month
ago
.
one
of
the
service
that
be
restart
be
BreastCheck
,
which
have
be
close
for
many
month
and
have
over
240000
on
the
mammogram
waiting
list
.
this
scanning
be
deem
unsafe
due
to
Covid
transmission
rate
,
but
how
be
it
there
be
no
proposal
to
try
to
provide
screen
testing
to
BreastCheck
patient
in
advance
of
they
scan
to
keep
the
service
operational
?
this
sound
like
failure
,
not
fail
-
safe
.
the
same
rationale
apply
to
many
other
activity
,
both
public
and
private
,
that
be
currently
furlough
.
could
we
health
expert
not
follow
the
lead
of
country
such
as
England
,
Germany
,
France
and
the
US
and
implement
antigen
screen
testing
in
many
of
we
work
setting
?
what
be
to
stop
we
screen
test
construction
worker
every
two
day
use
antigen
test
,
to
open
the
construction
sector
and
monitor
the
testing
effectiveness
?
there
be
many
other
sector
and
area
that
could
benefit
from
this
approach
.
the
current
plan
pathway
give
nothing
certain
to
the
business
sector
other
than
the
promise
of
continue
support
,
which
,
for
many
,
be
like
pump
oxygen
into
a
dead
body
.
many
private
business
owner
be
face
significant
warehouse
debt
and
demand
for
rent
and
utility
.
moreover
,
they
be
incur
significant
interest
penalty
on
long
-
term
loan
on
which
the
bank
be
once
again
look
for
payment
.
many
owner
know
full
well
that
when
they
resume
trading
,
they
revenue
will
be
a
fraction
of
it
be
pre-Covid
and
be
likely
to
remain
that
way
,
leave
they
business
technically
insolvent
.
this
business
need
something
like
certainty
.
the
government
should
implement
the
kind
of
step
that
be
speak
about
early
on
in
the
crisis
,
namely
,
widespread
population
screen
,
rigorous
testing
and
border
control
.
I
do
not
think
that
we
can
continue
to
limp
along
,
wait
on
European
medicine
supplies
to
fully
deliver
we
from
this
crisis
.
we
need
to
find
new
way
to
live
with
this
virus
while
we
wait
for
the
technology
,
which
hopefully
will
fully
eradicate
it
in
the
future
.
the
Labour
Party
will
be
support
the
Sinn
Féin
Bill
.
it
so
happen
that
the
Labour
Party
also
have
a
Bill
on
this
very
issue
which
be
wind
its
way
through
the
Seanad
as
we
speak
.
the
Labour
Party
Bill
,
which
be
very
similar
to
the
Sinn
Féin
Bill
,
come
with
a
proposal
by
the
government
to
issue
its
own
Bill
so
,
in
effect
,
we
will
have
three
bill
on
this
very
issue
before
long
.
that
speak
volume
about
the
intent
of
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
to
legislate
for
this
issue
.
we
would
hope
that
,
ultimately
,
common
ground
will
be
find
on
the
three
Bills
in
order
that
the
issue
can
be
properly
deal
with
.
we
Bill
seek
to
carry
out
the
express
wish
of
survivor
of
mother
and
baby
home
and
other
adopt
person
.
my
colleague
,
Senator
Ivana
Bacik
,
have
speak
to
this
very
issue
in
the
Seanad
.
I
be
use
she
word
when
I
say
there
be
a
urgent
need
to
legislate
for
robust
and
effective
information
and
tracing
rights
for
adopt
person
.
Successive
government
have
spend
year
examine
how
good
to
formulate
such
legislation
.
we
short
Bill
,
similar
to
the
Sinn
Féin
Bill
,
would
enable
adopt
person
to
obtain
the
information
necessary
to
access
they
birth
certificate
.
there
have
never
be
a
absolute
ban
on
provide
this
information
enable
a
link
to
be
make
between
the
register
of
birth
and
the
register
of
adoption
.
the
adoption
authority
and
the
court
have
always
be
entitle
to
order
the
production
of
record
that
enable
a
applicant
to
trace
the
link
.
we
be
aware
of
the
argument
make
about
the
need
to
balance
the
right
of
adopt
person
to
access
they
birth
information
with
the
privacy
rights
of
birth
mother
but
current
state
policy
be
skew
towards
privacy
rights
.
currently
,
unless
a
natural
mother
have
indicate
she
preference
for
contact
,
she
presume
wish
for
secrecy
override
the
adopt
adult
's
right
to
know
he
or
she
identity
.
in
essence
,
I
think
we
all
wish
to
legislate
for
that
,
hence
we
support
the
Sinn
Féin
Bill
.
we
hope
for
reciprocal
support
from
Sinn
Féin
and
indeed
government
support
for
we
Bill
as
it
wind
its
way
through
the
Seanad
.
we
await
the
government
's
proposal
and
hope
the
minister
will
make
haste
on
that
.
I
know
he
be
very
active
on
this
issue
.
the
important
point
to
note
be
that
this
bill
cater
only
for
validly
adopt
people
who
can
access
the
information
hold
in
the
register
.
the
minister
speak
to
that
issue
.
this
will
do
nothing
for
the
recently
highlight
cohort
of
illegally
or
invalidly
adopt
people
because
there
be
no
accessible
record
in
the
register
or
with
the
Adoption
Authority
of
Ireland
relate
to
they
.
I
want
to
use
my
time
to
speak
to
that
very
issue
.
I
listen
to
the
minister
on
"
Morning
Ireland
"
early
and
I
note
he
intention
in
respect
of
the
publication
of
the
independent
review
report
into
illegal
birth
registration
and
he
proposal
,
as
I
understand
it
,
that
he
call
on
the
special
rapporteur
,
Professor
Conor
O'Mahony
,
"
to
consider
and
propose
next
step
"
.
the
question
on
we
mind
be
this
:
what
do
the
minister
envisage
this
process
will
yield
?
the
minister
also
state
:
neither
AAI
nor
Tusla
be
able
to
identify
a
unique
marker
which
be
suggestive
of
incorrect
birth
registration
,
similar
to
that
find
in
the
St.
Patrick
Guild
's
case
.
while
the
sampling
review
of
the
file
do
identify
some
potential
marker
or
wording
suggestive
of
marker
,
both
agency
report
that
they
be
unable
to
establish
'
clear
evidence
of
incorrect
birth
registration
'
.
if
base
on
a
sample
take
now
or
recently
the
Adoption
Authority
of
Ireland
and
Tusla
be
unable
to
find
clear
evidence
of
incorrect
birth
registration
,
what
be
the
point
-
I
be
not
suggest
there
be
no
point
-
of
move
towards
a
independent
review
by
the
special
rapporteur
if
it
yield
the
same
end
result
?
we
welcome
the
minister
's
thinking
on
this
matter
because
it
be
important
to
do
it
,
but
I
be
think
beyond
that
now
.
there
be
no
doubt
the
bona
fide
of
Professor
O'Mahony
,
let
I
put
that
on
the
record
,
and
we
certainly
welcome
the
process
.
it
be
to
take
six
month
,
as
I
understand
it
.
beyond
that
,
however
,
if
,
at
the
end
of
the
process
,
Professor
O'Mahony
come
to
the
same
conclusion
,
where
will
we
go
from
there
?
I
be
leave
think
that
the
only
solution
be
a
full
public
inquiry
whereby
potentially
all
the
file
,
not
just
a
sample
,
can
be
audite
.
there
may
be
a
argument
against
that
.
if
there
be
,
I
certainly
would
like
to
hear
it
.
however
,
in
light
of
the
report
on
the
mother
and
baby
home
and
in
light
of
a
clear
wish
on
the
part
of
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
to
deal
with
all
this
issue
in
a
open
and
transparent
way
in
order
that
they
be
not
leave
to
be
deal
with
by
future
generation
of
deputy
and
Senator
,
why
not
have
a
public
inquiry
in
respect
of
the
independent
review
into
illegal
birth
registration
and
open
it
all
up
in
a
transparent
way
such
that
every
file
be
examine
in
order
that
everybody
can
be
satisfied
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
State
's
reaction
to
this
very
important
issue
?
it
be
something
that
have
cross
my
mind
.
I
be
fearful
that
if
Professor
O'Mahony
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
independent
review
,
it
will
leave
many
people
extremely
disappointed
.
time
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
or
woman
and
people
be
get
old
.
therefore
,
should
we
not
now
consider
the
idea
of
a
full
public
inquiry
into
this
in
order
that
all
of
the
file
can
be
examine
fully
,
not
just
a
sample
?
I
do
not
profess
to
have
the
wisdom
of
Solomon
on
this
issue
,
but
I
fear
that
it
may
not
be
conclude
thereafter
.
will
we
end
up
tell
people
that
there
be
absolutely
no
way
that
the
State
can
interrogate
every
single
illegal
adoption
and
there
be
no
mechanism
open
to
the
State
to
do
that
but
that
we
should
hold
a
full
-
scale
public
inquiry
into
this
issue
in
order
that
we
can
satisfy
ourselves
,
as
well
as
everybody
who
have
be
impact
by
illegal
adoption
,
that
the
State
have
do
everything
within
its
wherewithal
to
examine
and
interrogate
every
single
issue
related
to
it
?
I
be
not
call
for
it
;
I
be
merely
suggest
it
as
a
potential
course
of
action
.
we
will
await
and
see
the
result
of
the
process
put
in
place
by
the
minister
in
respect
of
the
appointment
of
the
special
rapporteur
to
consider
and
propose
the
next
step
.
however
,
it
would
be
good
to
hear
from
the
minister
as
to
what
that
next
step
will
be
.
the
minister
and
he
official
will
have
some
view
as
to
what
the
next
step
will
be
.
the
minister
will
not
be
whole
dependent
on
the
special
rapporteur
;
he
will
also
have
he
own
view
on
this
issue
.
I
suppose
that
be
where
we
be
go
with
this
.
I
thank
the
minister
and
Deputy
for
they
co-operation
.
that
conclude
question
to
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Climate
and
Communication
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
speech
.
by
any
objective
analysis
,
the
White
Paper
have
result
in
clear
action
on
the
part
of
the
government
.
he
have
come
before
we
today
to
articulate
that
area
where
progress
be
be
make
,
especially
concern
access
to
education
.
that
aspect
be
a
key
element
for
every
young
person
in
the
direct
provision
process
.
education
be
the
key
to
build
for
a
future
where
we
integrate
people
and
give
they
the
rights
to
which
they
be
entitle
by
dint
of
any
international
standard
.
I
,
therefore
,
welcome
the
progress
on
that
aspect
.
I
do
not
propose
to
detain
the
House
for
too
long
,
but
I
would
like
to
ask
the
minister
about
the
Irish
Nationality
and
Citizenship
(
Naturalisation
of
Minor
bear
in
Ireland
)
Bill
2018
.
regard
the
recent
success
in
get
agreement
on
this
Bill
,
which
,
if
fully
implement
,
would
give
a
pathway
to
citizenship
to
child
bear
in
direct
provision
,
if
we
could
see
that
bear
fruit
,
it
would
be
a
massive
leap
forward
for
society
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
government
be
committed
to
that
.
the
campaign
to
count
time
as
a
asylum
seeker
as
reckonable
residence
be
ongoing
.
the
Labour
Party
be
in
contact
with
the
Movement
of
Asylum
seeker
Ireland
,
MASI
,
on
that
issue
.
I
be
pretty
sure
the
representative
of
the
minister
and
the
government
be
also
in
contact
in
that
regard
.
that
would
be
a
big
leap
forward
.
we
accept
the
recommendation
of
the
report
by
Catherine
Day
as
we
own
de
facto
policy
in
September
.
we
acknowledge
that
perhaps
the
government
's
White
Paper
be
marginally
less
ambitious
than
the
day
report
,
but
it
be
still
very
ambitious
.
that
must
be
acknowledge
.
I
welcome
the
progress
regard
the
issuance
of
driver
licence
as
well
.
this
be
what
I
would
call
simple
,
low
-
hanging
fruit
issue
,
but
they
be
significant
to
so
many
people
in
regard
to
give
they
the
freedom
to
move
,
notwithstand
the
current
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
it
allow
people
to
move
.
it
allow
people
freedom
and
independence
.
therefore
,
we
welcome
progress
in
all
of
that
respects
.
we
very
much
support
the
government
's
position
in
respect
of
the
White
Paper
and
will
work
with
it
in
push
on
the
issue
.
we
be
hopeful
that
the
commitment
make
in
respect
of
the
length
of
stay
in
reception
or
integration
centre
be
no
more
than
four
month
will
prevail
and
succeed
.
there
be
one
issue
that
be
bring
to
we
attention
yesterday
.
RTÉ
report
,
through
its
reporter
,
Laura
Fletcher
,
that
two
healthcare
worker
have
to
leave
they
job
in
nursing
home
due
to
issue
over
temporary
accommodation
.
the
story
be
widely
report
yesterday
on
RTÉ
.
the
report
state
that
this
worker
could
no
long
avail
of
a
HSE
temporary
accommodation
scheme
and
be
subsequently
return
to
direct
provision
.
in
one
case
,
a
worker
be
place
200
kilometer
from
where
she
live
and
work
.
my
understanding
be
that
nowhere
do
it
say
in
documentation
,
and
the
report
highlight
this
,
that
eligibility
criterion
be
dependent
on
whether
or
not
there
be
Covid
-
19
case
in
the
workplace
.
the
context
of
the
HSE
kick
this
two
worker
out
of
temporary
accommodation
remain
to
be
examine
further
.
I
will
now
quote
from
the
report
and
one
of
the
woman
involve
:
"
my
employer
tell
I
that
you
can't
stay
in
the
HSE
accommodation
anymore
because
they
say
that
we
do
not
have
any
case
[
of
Covid
-
19
]
in
we
nursing
home
.
"
be
I
out
of
time
?
I
do
not
realise
that
I
have
so
little
time
.
Gabh
mo
leithscéal
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
address
that
point
,
because
this
be
issue
that
be
stumble
block
to
the
progress
that
we
be
try
to
make
.
I
thank
deputy
O'Callaghan
.
as
he
mention
,
we
be
at
level
5
and
we
need
to
see
ramp
-
up
vaccination
level
and
continue
suppression
of
the
virus
.
as
I
say
,
the
Ferguson
report
offer
the
prospect
of
build
on
the
work
the
expert
group
have
do
with
the
FAI
,
IRFU
and
GAA
on
a
plan
regard
the
return
of
spectator
.
I
believe
we
will
see
that
this
summer
and
we
will
be
able
to
start
to
pilot
and
to
test
event
.
we
would
all
like
to
see
spectator
back
at
one
of
the
all
-
Ireland
match
or
even
at
League
of
Ireland
game
this
summer
.
I
be
positive
and
optimistic
about
that
.
it
be
about
timing
,
however
.
we
have
have
planning
on
this
since
autumn
of
last
year
with
the
draft
return
of
spectator
and
test
event
underpin
by
that
.
the
Ferguson
report
complement
we
capacity
to
do
that
.
as
deputy
O'Callaghan
mention
,
antigen
testing
will
play
a
key
role
,
not
only
around
sport
but
also
third
level
education
and
other
key
area
of
society
that
we
want
to
see
reopen
and
stay
open
.
the
deputy
mention
that
we
have
be
in
a
difficult
position
with
the
Euro
2020
match
.
we
have
not
be
able
to
give
the
assurance
of
25
%
spectator
in
the
Aviva
Stadium
for
that
game
.
that
will
obviously
have
a
impact
on
UEFA
's
decision
.
it
be
very
difficult
to
be
able
give
certainty
at
this
point
and
tell
people
that
we
can
have
11000
or
12,000
spectator
present
in
June
when
we
have
such
a
overarching
degree
of
restriction
.
I
share
the
deputy
's
view
,
however
.
we
need
to
get
sport
prioritise
and
reopen
and
we
be
do
so
.
next
Monday
,
we
will
see
we
kid
back
play
in
pod
of
15
again
.
hopefully
,
we
can
extend
that
to
a
great
extent
in
May
and
then
,
through
the
summer
,
as
I
say
,
see
not
only
the
return
of
all
-
Ireland
and
League
of
Ireland
game
but
also
the
broad
return
of
competition
in
sport
,
which
many
young
people
and
adult
have
miss
out
on
for
many
month
.
I
be
ambitious
about
that
and
we
all
want
to
see
it
return
and
continue
.

and
mental
health

the
Labour
Party
welcome
the
Bill
.
we
will
support
it
but
will
table
amendment
to
it
to
make
it
more
robust
.
I
will
start
by
acknowledge
the
countless
email
I
have
receive
from
my
constituent
in
Cork
East
in
respect
of
the
Bill
.
there
be
one
or
two
point
that
I
would
like
to
see
address
in
it
,
as
reflect
in
the
email
from
my
constituent
.
the
first
relate
to
the
Climate
Change
Advisory
Council
and
the
adequacy
of
the
2050
net
zero
target
.
it
be
vitally
important
to
reflect
the
fact
that
climate
change
do
not
affect
everyone
or
every
county
equally
but
impact
first
,
and
most
profoundly
,
on
poorer
country
,
county
and
community
,
on
that
that
have
do
the
least
to
cause
the
problem
and
who
have
the
least
resource
to
cope
.
a
target
of
net
zero
emission
by
2050
,
which
be
the
climate
neutrality
objective
as
define
in
the
Bill
,
be
simply
too
little
,
too
late
,
be
out
of
step
with
the
scientific
advice
present
to
the
Oireachtas
and
do
not
amount
to
we
fair
share
of
the
global
effort
need
to
deliver
on
the
Paris
agreement
.
the
second
point
relate
to
the
just
transition
,
a
phrase
that
be
use
quite
often
in
this
debate
.
it
be
important
to
acknowledge
that

that

if

why
be
we

little

just

2021
will
be
a

of

,
with

there
have
always

plenty
of

from

,
yet
the
Department
be
fail
to
capitalise
on
this
interest
and
convert
it
into

.
why
be
that
happen
?
it
be
because
we
have
a
licensing

be
simply
not

cannot
produce

failure
by

already
make
for
very
grim
reading
on
what
carbon
we
have
fail
to
capture
due
to

.
indeed
,
my
party
colleague
,
deputy
Brendan
Howlin
,
last
week
request
this
information
in
a
parliamentary
question
and
receive
a
reply
from
the
Department
,
state
that
over
the
last
five
year
there
have
be
a
shortfall
in
meeting
target
of
15,365
ha
.
be
this
area
to
be
afforested
with
70
%
conifer
and
30
%
broadleaf
,
this
forest
would
have
the
potential
to
remove
5.8
million
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
over
they
lifetime
,
take
into
account
the
fact
forest
be
fell
and
replant
.
if
we
be
to
take
climate
action
seriously
the
long
-
run
saga
within
the
Department
must
be
address
without
delay
.
there
be
a
need
to
bind
afforestation
target
into
this
legislation
.
that
be
something
the
Labour
Party
will
examine
on
Committee
stage
.
I
welcome
that
my
party
have
tab
this
motion
.
I
welcome
the
fact
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
be
here
to
address
the
issue
specifically
,
as
be
she
colleague
the
minister
,
deputy
O'Gorman
.
the
Minister
of
State
refer
to
1860
case
.
I
ask
she
to
respond
to
this
late
in
the
debate
.
the
HSE
have
advise
I
that
on
8
April
,
the
number
of
overdue
application
for
assessment
of
need
be
50078
.
on
the
face
of
it
,
there
seem
to
be
a
contradiction
between
the
figure
the
Minister
of
State
mention
this
evening
for
the
number
who
be
wait
and
the
figure
supply
to
I
by
the
HSE
.
it
be
a
major
issue
to
have
50078
child
overdue
for
assessment
of
need
.
I
would
be
very
grateful
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
respond
to
that
.
if
there
be
now
only
1860
case
,
that
would
indeed
be
significant
progress
.
while
I
do
not
wish
to
be
cynical
,
the
Minister
of
State
will
forgive
I
if
I
question
the
figure
present
to
we
tonight
.
I
seek
further
clarity
on
that
.
we
be
force
to
table
tonight
's
motion
because
thousand

the

still
do
not

I
appreciate
the
point
the
Minister
of
State
have
make
on
the
focus
on
assessment
of
need
.
I
appreciate
the
progress
that
have
be
make
.
we
acknowledge
that
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
be
the
first
minister
in
a
number
of
year
to
have
tackle
the
lethargy
within
the
HSE
on
this
issue
.
it
be
extraordinary
that
a
minister
of
State
have
to
push
back
against
official
within
the
HSE
,
who
do
not
want
to
deliver
this
service
and
will
find
every
excuse
not
to
.
we
wish
she
well
in
that
regard
.
however
,
this
be
about
child
.
notwithstanding
the
argument
that
have
be
make
about
assessment
of
need
and
the
methodology
which
have
be
critique
by
psychologist
regard
how
that
list
have
be
dramatically
reduce
and
if
we
accept
at
face
value
that
they
have
be
reduce
,
there
be
still
the
significant
issue
of
the
follow
-
on
service
.
some
€
7.8
million
be
spend
on
this
and
I
welcome
that
the
minister
be
able
to
secure
this
amount
.
however
,
the
HSE
pay
€
8.7
million
to
Deloitte
,
EY
,
KPMG
and
PwC
for
consultancy
service
during
the
pandemic
.
that
figure
come
in
the
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
receive
last
week
.
we
need
to
start
prioritise
thing
in
the
HSE
.
the
car

I
have
raise
this
issue
many
time
.
I
basically
seek
the
government
to
put
in
place
a
waiver
for
family
with
disability
or
where
there
be
long
-
term
illness
,
for
example
,
where
incontinence
pad
or
pull
-
up
be
require
in
the
case
of
child
or
young
adult
,
so
that
the
cost
of
refuse
be
defray
or
reduce
.
this
would
be
by
virtue
of
the
introduction
of
a
national
waiver
,
which
would
be
sanction
by
government
and
would
provide
a
measure
of
financial
alleviation
for
many
hard
-
press
family
,
in
particular
work
family
with
child
with
disability
.
I
raise
this
issue
,
about
which
I
feel
very
strongly
,
on
a
number
of
occasion
with
three
minister
.
what
be
of
little
cost
to
the
Exchequer
could
have
a
massive
impact
on
the
annual
expense
of
family
who
rely
on
incontinence
pad
or
where
there
be
significant
medical
issue
,
particularly
family
with

who
have
a
requirement
,
either
in

or
young
adulthood
and
onwards
,
for

minister
,
include
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
,
have
tell
I
that
there
be
,
in
essence
,
a
price
monitoring
group
.
he
say
:
in
a
effort
to
see
how
good
to
support
person
with
long

respect
to
the

...
[
his

Department
...
[
have
]
be
examine
this
issue
in
detail
for
some
time
and
have
engage
with
relevant
stakeholder
,
include
representative
organisation
and
the
HSE
.
I
merely
wish
to
know
whether
the
government
be
give
active
consideration
to
this
.
in
anticipation
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
,
I
would
say
please
do
not
come
back
to
I
with
the
general
datum
protection
regulation
,
gdpr
,
response
or
the
sensitive
medical
datum
response
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
responsibility
for
that
area
.
it
have
be
throw
up
as
a
red
herring
in
respect
of
not
deal
with
this
issue
.
one
cannot
expect
a
family
to
dispose
of
this
type
of
matter
through
recycling
or
through
the
compost
bin
.
that
be
self
-
evident
.
it
must
be
do
through
residual
waste
.
in
part
of
the
country
with
a
weight
-
base
system
,
bill
be
as
high
as
€400
.
I
have
see
example
of
€400
,
€500
and
€600
per
annum
.
it
be
a
significant
cost
.
for
what
would
be
a
small
,
barely
measurable
dent
in
Exchequer
funding
,
this
could
have
a
massive
impact
for
family
,
and
it
can
be
do
.
person
yield
up
sensitive
medical
information
to
the
Department
of
social
Protection
when
apply
for
a
invalidity
pension
,
a
disability
allowance
or
a
illness
benefit
.
a
similar
scheme
could
be
devise
for
this
family
where
sensitive
medical
datum
could
be
yield
up
in
a
safe
,
responsible
and
secure
way
.
it
would
have
a
massive
impact
on
thousand
of
family
throughout
the
State
who
be
bear
a
massive
financial
burden
.
the
Minister
of
State
say
there
be
a
government
decision
envisage
"
the
provision
of
a
financial
support
to
person
with
lifelong
/
long
-
term
medical
incontinence
to
help
meet
the
cost
of
disposal
of
medical
incontinence
wear
"
.
what
he
have
tell
we
be
that
they
have
no
intention
of
do
this
.
minister
after
minister
have
be
talk
around
and
tell
I
the
same
thing
for
nearly
four
year
.
we
either
look
after
vulnerable
people
in
this
society
or
we
do
not
.
on
the
suggestion
to
family
that
this
be
a
market
solution
and
that
they
should
go
to
they
local
provider
,
I
can
tell
the
Minister
of
State
that
I
have
hear
from
a
family
with
two
child
-
they
parent
be
John
and
Neasa
-
a
five
-
year
-
old
and
a
15
-
year
-
old
,
both
on
pull
-
up
.
they
cost
be
€
400
per
year
.
a
working
family
with
a
mortgage
try
to
do
they
good
,
they
know
that
they
will
have
to
deal
with
this
as
a
long
-
term
issue
for
they
child
.
they
go
to
they
local
provider
but
the
market
will
not
sort
they
out
because
they
local
provider
,
which
be
a
significant
collector
of
waste
in
the
north
Cork
area
and
provide
a
excellent
service
,
have
say
that
this
be
a
matter
for
government
.
there
be
a
government
decision
on
this
.
I
be
hopeful
,
dare
I
say
it
,
that
a
Green
minister
with
responsibility
for
this
would
come
to
I
with
a
answer
that
would
at
least
see
some
progression
of
the
issue
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
not
to
throw
the
market
issue
or
the
price
monitoring
group
at
we
and
to
bring
in
all
the
provider
and
get
it
do
if
at
all
possible
.
so
many
family
throughout
the
country
would
be
so
grateful
that
some
government
finally
would
have
deal
significantly
with
this
issue
.
for
a
small
cost
to
the
Exchequer
,
it
would
be
so
meaningful
for
so
many
family
.
I
believe
this
be
the
first
time
the
Acting
Chairman
,
deputy
Kathleen
Funchion
,
have
be
in
the
role
and
I
wish
she
well
.
I
be
delighted
to
have
the
privilege
of
be
the
first
speaker
on
she
watch
.
I
support
the
motion
.
I
want
to
speak
specifically
about
my
constituency
,
which
include
north
and
east
Cork
.
in
the
first
instance
,
I
will
speak
for
Mitchelstown
.
I
have
have
engagement
for
quite
some
time
with
Cork
County
Council
,
Irish
Water
and
local
business
interest
in
respect
of
the
need
to
ensure
the
plan
wastewater
treatment
plant
upgrade
will
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
and
,
in
the
absence
of
this
take
place
within
the
next
one
to
three
year
,
the
need
for
a
interim
solution
to
find
capacity
within
the
exist
infrastructure
so
that
planning
and
development
can
take
place
in
Mitchelstown
.
it
be
vital
that
Irish
Water
,
Cork
County
Council
and
local
industry
interest
,
which
be
also
vital
to
the
community
,
come
together
to
ensure
a
interim
solution
can
be
find
so
we
can
begin
build
house
again
.
if
capacity
could
be
find
within
the
exist
infrastructure
,
either
by
increase
the
capacity
of
the
exist
wastewater
treatment
plant
or
by
look
at
the
licensing
arrangement
on
the
outflow
pipe
,
we
could
start
to
develop
housing
,
residential
property
and
home
for
people
in
town
such
as
Mitchelstown
,
which
so
badly
need
they
.
I
be
happy
to
say
the
quality
of
my
engagement
with
Irish
Water
,
Cork
County
Council
and
local
business
leader
have
intensify
in
recent
month
.
I
be
hopeful
that
,
short
of
build
the
new
wastewater
treatment
plant
,
a
interim
solution
use
the
exist
infrastructure
can
,
in
the
short
term
,
result
in
a
agreement
between
all
the
vital
stakeholder
,
include
Irish
Water
,
Cork
County
Council
,
Dairygold
,
Ornua
and
the
big
industrial
complex
vital
to
the
future
of
Mitchelstown
.
I
hope
a
way
forward
can
be
find
under
the
exist
infrastructure
,
result
in
the
development
of
housing
so
that
people
can
get
on
the
housing
ladder
,
footfall
can
be
create
in
the
town
,
business
can
continue
to
flourish
and
operate
and
more
school
place
can
be
develop
.
if
the
town
be
to
develop
,
it
need
a
upgrade
of
the
exist
plant
as
a
interim
solution
prior
to
the
next
investment
come
down
the
track
.
if
this
can
be
do
as
a
short
-
term
measure
,
it
would
provide
massive
alleviation
to
the
people
of
Mitchelstown
.
it
would
also
allow
business
to
keep
go
and
local
developer
to
develop
and
build
house
.
this
be
what
we
want
to
see
.
I
be
happy
a
solution
be
be
work
on
and
it
be
a
live
process
.
I
be
hopeful
there
will
be
a
positive
outcome
in
the
come
week
that
will
at
least
allow
business
activity
to
start
and
allow
developer
to
start
turn
sod
and
reignite
planning
application
.
it
would
give
they
cover
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
if
they
be
to
flourish
,
town
such
as
Mitchelstown
need
a
influx
of
new
housing
,
new
people
and
new
generation
to
be
create
to
ensure
they
future
viability
.
I
hope
something
can
be
do
,
and
we
be
actively
work
on
find
a
interim
solution
.
I
be
devote
a
lot
of
my
time
and
energy
towards
give
effect
to
this
.
I
also
want
to
speak
about
Glanworth
.
I
welcome
the
engagement
I
have
have
so
far
with
Irish
Water
in
respect
of
the
2.3
kilometer
of
water
main
that
have
be
identify
for
rehabilitation
.
it
be
important
that
we
acknowledge
the
€
160000
that
have
be
allocate
for
2021
.
I
ask
Irish
Water
to
prioritise
Glanworth
.
it
be
another
important
area
that
have
be
the
subject
of
many
break
and
leakage
over
recent
year
.
while
the
citizen
of
Glanworth
welcome
the
investment
of
€
160000
,
they
want
to
see
the
upgrade
of
the
2.3
kilometer
of
water
main
so
this
issue
can
be
finally
solve
and
put
to
bed
.
I
continue
to
implore
,
ask
and
lobby
in
every
way
I
can
to
ensure
Glanworth
be
also
see
to
.
I
also
welcome
the
fact
that
work
be
take
place
in
Mallow
.
they
will
go
a
long
way
towards
alleviate
the
sewerage
issue
in
my
home
town
.
they
will
also
ensure
Mallow
be
give
a
chance
to
develop
in
a
way
that
ensure
no
impediment
be
put
in
the
way
of
future
housing
development
.
it
be
vital
that
town
such
as
Mallow
,
which
be
designate
in
the
national
planning
framework
,
be
give
a
chance
to
develop
.
as
with
Mitchelstown
and
all
the
town
in
my
constituency
,
we
want
to
see
responsible
development
.
we
want
to
see
proper
capacity
be
build
to
ensure
that
town
can
flourish
,
local
business
and
school
all
benefit
and
we
have
the
intergenerational
flow
that
be
vital
and
check
the
balance
of
regional
development
against
everything
flow
towards
the
eastern
seaboard
.
if
town
such
as
Mallow
be
to
flourish
,
it
be
vital
that
they
have
the
infrastructure
to
go
with
it
.
I
continue
to
work
on
a
solution
for
Mitchelstown
with
Irish
Water
,
Cork
County
Council
and
the
other
stakeholder
.
I
hope
we
can
find
a
interim
solution
.
it
be
vital
that
the
licence
be
look
at
in
some
way
,
shape
or
form
in
the
future
with
a
view
to
increase
the
outflow
capacity
,
so
that
when
the
new
treatment
plant
be
build
there
be
no
further
issue
down
the
line
regard
outflow
.
we
must
ensure
that
there
be
development
in
Mitchelstown
,
that
we
can
build
house
there
and
that
local
,
intergenerational
,
family
-
run
business
be
give
a
fighting
change
.
we
must
ensure
that
young
people
who
want
to
buy
home
where
they
have
grow
up
,
work
,
live
and
have
family
link
be
not
imped
in
any
way
.
the
Labour
Party
be
support
this
Bill
and
we
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
bring
it
forward
.
it
will
provide
a
considerable
amount
of
alleviation
for
farm
family
.
who
among
we
have
not
have
a
person
from
a
farm
family
on
the
telephone
tell
we
about
how
a
love
one
be
fill
out
the
form
for
the
nursing
home
support
scheme
and
express
deep
doubt
about
the
process
?
some
of
that
doubt
be
because
it
be
the
end
of
the
road
in
term
of
be
able
to
care
for
somebody
at
home
.
it
be
often
the
last
resort
for
a
spouse
in
respect
of
he
or
she
love
one
.
it
be
always
with
deep
reluctance
that
people
agree
that
it
be
in
a
love
one
's
good
interest
to
go
into
a
residential
unit
or
nursing
home
.
on
top
of
that
be
the
add
pressure
of
not
know
where
people
will
stand
financially
as
a
result
of
take
that
decision
to
sign
up
to
the
nursing
home
support
scheme
.
person
too
often
tell
we
of
they
concern
about
what
the
charge
will
be
on
they
x
amount
in
asset
and
where
it
will
leave
they
and
they
family
in
term
of
they
future
financial
security
.
there
be
no
question
that
this
Bill
go
some
way
towards
address
this
and
,
for
that
reason
,
it
must
be
support
.
who
among
we
have
not
deal
with
a
family
whose
savings
,
which
be
build
up
with
bare
hand
work
the
land
,
have
be
whittle
down
to
nothing
?
in
many
case
,
people
start
with
nothing
or
with
a
very
meagre
hold
and
build
it
up
through
year
and
year
of
hard
work
,
only
to
find
it
be
to
be
scatter
like
grain
on
infertile
ground
.
although
they
love
one
be
be
care
for
,
there
be
often
nothing
leave
in
reserve
.
that
seem
to
I
to
be
a
awful
waste
and
a
awful
shame
for
all
that
year
of
work
people
put
into
build
up
this
people
's
holding
.
the
Bill
alleviate
that
.
as
I
understand
it
,
it
do
not
apply
retrospectively
,
so
we
spare
a
thought
for
the
people
who
have
go
through
the
double
hardship
of
have
savings
whittle
down
and
have
have
to
make
the
decision
on
a
love
one
's
nursing
home
care
.
we
have
to
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
IFA
in
this
issue
.
it
be
interesting
to
read
some
of
the
debate
and
the
submission
that
be
bring
forward
by
the
IFA
in
respect
of
the
pre-legislative
scrutiny
in
2019
.
I
note
in
particular
the
association
's
submission
through
its
then
president
,
Mr.
Joe
Healy
,
in
which
he
encapsulate
the
matter
very
well
:
[
significant
]
uncertainty
and
anxiety
have
be
create
for
family
farm
,
with
fear
that
the
viability
of
the
farm
will
be
undermine
or
lose
while
attempt
to
meet
the
cost
of
care
.
this
have
lead
to
the
introduction
of
a
three
-
year
cap
on
farm
business
asset
in
circumstance
of
sudden
illness
.
it
be
also
important
to
note
that
asset
transfer
for
less
than
five
year
be
include
in
the
assessment
of
means
.
as
...
[
you
]
can
imagine
,
this
have
prove
to
be
a
barrier
to
the
next
generation
take
over
the
family
farm
due
to
the
debt
owe
on
the
farm
business
asset
.
to
be
fair
to
the
Minister
of
State
and
the
government
,
they
have
seek
to
address
this
imbalance
in
the
system
,
and
that
be
absolutely
to
be
welcome
.
it
be
important
for
we
to
look
as
a
society
at
the
entirety
of
care
for
old
people
,
give
we
demographic
whereby
people
be
live
long
than
historically
be
the
case
.
there
be
a
very
interesting
debate
in
the
Seanad
on
10
May
,
at
which
the
Minister
of
State
may
have
be
in
attendance
.
my
colleague
,
Senator
Bacik
,
participate
,
state
:
despite
there
be
half
a
million
carer
in
Ireland
,
the
issue
of
care
and
the
immense
challenge
face
both
by
carer
and
the
people
for
whom
they
care
be
often
neglect
.
Ireland
's
population
be
ageing
and
people
with
disability
comprise
a
significant
portion
of
the
people
live
in
we
community
.
however
,
the
State
remain
reluctant
to
address
the
fact
that
most
of
we
will
either
require
care
ourselves
,
or
will
have
to
give
care
to
another
,
and
that
the
infrastructure
currently
in
place
be
seriously
lack
.
she
further
state
:
[
T
]he
State
's
default
preference
for
institutional
care
be
archaic
and
highly
problematic
.
not
to
mention
that
this
preference
be
not
in
the
spirit
of
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Right
of
Person
with
Disability
,
UNCRPD
,
which
Ireland
ratify
in
2018
,
it
cause
havoc
in
the
real
life
of
the
thousand
of
people
live
in
this
country
who
cannot
do
so
independently
.
we
have
become
all
too
use
to
hear
horror
story
about
we
break
care
model
,
whether
that
concern
the
scandalous
practice
of
inappropriately
housing
young
people
in
nursing
home
,
or
the
tragic
loss
of
life
in
institutional
care
setting
that
we
have
see
over
the
past
year
due
to
Covid
-
19
.
again
,
to
be
fair
to
the
minister
,
she
be
seek
in
she
approach
to
fix
one
element
of
that
,
and
this
legislative
proposal
before
we
do
that
.
however
,
we
in
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
should
have
regard
to
the
issue
of
we
ageing
population
such
that
we
can
put
in
place
a
housing
infrastructure
that
allow
people
to
downsize
and
live
independently
or
to
create
community
across
this
land
that
allow
people
to
live
independently
but
in
a
shelter
environment
such
that
they
retain
they
independence
but
there
be
share
service
.
in
the
context
of
today
's
debate
on
housing
and
the
motion
on
wastewater
treatment
service
tab
by
the
Regional
Group
,
I
believe
strongly
that
if
we
be
to
have
serious
regard
to
the
fact
that
we
be
all
age
and
that
some
of
we
will
be
able
to
live
very
independent
life
until
we
shake
off
this
mortal
coil
,
even
if
we
will
require
some
level
of
care
,
and
in
the
context
of
the
nursing
home
element
of
this
,
with
residential
care
another
element
of
it
,
where
there
be
level
of
dependency
from
low
to
high
,
then
a
housing
mix
that
allow
people
to
downsize
into
community
need
to
be
inculcate
into
political
debate
.
it
need
to
be
further
inculcate
into
how
we
devise
national
planning
framework
in
order
that
we
talk
not
only
about
young
people
get
on
the
housing
ladder
but
also
about
how
old
people
will
be
house
into
the
future
and
what
we
community
will
look
like
in
respect
of
the
third
or
fourth
age
,
when
people
reach
the
autumn
or
the
winter
of
they
life
.
nursing
home
be
a
part
of
that
narrative
but
not
the
only
part
.
I
acknowledge
the
Minister
of
State
be
very
conscious
of
this
because
she
have
speak
of
this
previously
.
I
know
she
be
very
cognisant
of
the
need
to
ensure
we
start
inculcate
new
language
into
the
debate
on
care
for
old
people
.
as
I
have
say
,
we
in
the
Labour
Party
support
this
legislation
.
we
hope
it
will
bring
peace
of
mind
to
many
farm
family
.
it
be
important
we
note
again
that
IFA
submission
on
the
pre-legislative
scrutiny
of
the
Bill
,
in
which
Mr.
Joe
Healy
quote
from
the
2018
Teagasc
national
farm
survey
,
which
show
that
30
%
of
farmer
be
aged
65
year
or
old
while
only
7
%
be
under
the
age
of
35
.
the
survey
also
show
that
average
farm
income
decline
by
21
%
in
2018
,
drop
from
approximately
€
30000
in
2017
to
€
23500
in
2018
.
his
submission
state
:
this
steady
erosion
of
farm
income
threaten
both
the
viability
and
sustainability
of
the
family
farm
and
the
sector
's
growth
prospect
.
this
can
be
clearly
see
in
the
survey
finding
with
only
34
%
or
47000
of
farm
classify
as
viable
.
we
can
interrogate
that
figure
more
closely
,
and
some
will
say
that
the
natural
result
of
there
not
be
intergenerational
solidarity
between
father
and
son
or
father
and
mother
and
daughter
go
into
family
farming
be
that
people
flee
the
land
,
which
then
allow
other
people
to
consolidate
farm
holding
.
what
we
want
to
see
be
a
system
that
ensure
that
as
many
people
who
want
to
stay
on
the
farm
as
possible
be
incentivise
to
do
so
.
we
do
not
want
to
see
another
Mansholt
plan
,
a
famous
European
commission
plan
date
back
to
the
1970
whereby
a
attempt
be
make
to
create
massive
industrial
-
type
holding
.
there
need
to
be
a
mix
that
include
the
small
,
sustainable
,
intergenerational
,
father
-
to
-
son
or
father
-
or
-
mother
-
to
-
daughter
farm
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
gendered
in
my
language
in
any
way
.
I
do
not
think
people
will
take
I
up
the
wrong
way
on
the
point
I
be
make
.
this
mix
should
allow
for
the
passing
of
the
farm
from
one
generation
to
another
and
ensure
that
no
disincentive
be
put
in
place
.
this
legislation
seek
to
provide
that
type
of
alleviation
at
least
.
it
take
out
one
worry
for
farmer
who
find
themselves
in
that
unfortunate
position
whereby
a
love
one
have
to
go
to
a
nursing
home
.
we
support
the
legislation
.
we
send
we
sympathy
to
people
who
find
themselves
face
with
very
difficult
decision
of
fill
out
the
form
and
make
the
life
-
change
decision
to
send
a
love
one
to
a
nursing
home
.
in
deal
with
the
financial
element
of
this
,
they
be
concerned
about
whether
they
financial
legacy
will
be
whittle
down
to
nothing
.
we
hope
this
legislation
will
at
least
provide
some
alleviation
for
they
at
this
time
.
I
be
talk
about
small
farmer
,
people
who
have
build
up
farm
holding
from
nothing
,
from
mere
blade
of
grass
to
field
of
green
.
we
must
be
mindful
of
that
people
who
be
the
backbone
of
the
co-operative
movement
and
who
continue
to
be
a
vital
part
of
we
life
on
this
island
.
obviously
,
I
always
err
on
the
side
of
wish
to
see
the
review
be
carry
out
soon
than
after
four
year
.
however
,
I
welcome
the
fact
that
it
have
be
reduce
from
five
year
to
four
year
.
that
be
a
positive
move
.

I
rise
to
support
Aer
Lingus
worker
.
the
minister
will
tell
we
that
the
government
have
a
€80
million
aviation
plan
and
that
€
120
million
be
give
to
Aer
Lingus
by
Ireland
Strategic
investment
Fund
,
ISIF
.
what
be
need
now
be
direct
support
for
worker
to
stave
off
and
stop
that
job
loss
in
Cork
and
Shannon
airport
.
the
government
must
start
subvent
that
job
,
keep
the
employee
on
the
payroll
and
ensure
they
can
get
through
this
period
of
turmoil
.
it
must
enable
we
to
retain
that
job
in
future
and
save
we
Aer
Lingus
airline
.
that
be
the
important
point
to
be
make
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
please
not
come
with
the
response
that
he
have
already
give
€
80
million
to
the
aviation
industry
,
because
nothing
specifically
have
be
give
to
the
airline
sector
.
person
will
tell
we
that
scheme
,
such
as
the
employee
wage
support
scheme
,
EWSS
,
and
the
Covid

to
process
that
could
be
devise
to
make
system
more
efficient
.
the
deputy
propose
notify
people
of
they
yearly
prsi
contribution
,
which
might
stave
off
case
where
the
citizen
come
up
to
retirement
have
to
phone
a
deputy
,
who
must
then
go
through
a
process
of
engage
with
the
Department
.
I
be
absolutely
delighted
to
do
this
on
behalf
of
the
citizen
but
if
the
citizen
have
be
inform
of
the
prsi
contribution
every
step
of
the
way
,
the
system
would
be
more
efficient
.
this
Bill
be
design
with
such
system
in
mind
.
I
accept
the
argument
make
by
the
minister
in
respect
of
the
citizen
Information
Board
and
I
admit
I
have
not
think
of
it
when
we
devise
the
Bill
.
I
accept
she
offer
to
seek
to
engage
where
there
be
perceive
failure
or
where
improvement
could
be
make
.
as
a
example
,
I
be
currently
deal
with
Aer
Lingus
worker
.
there
be
a
category
of
worker
who
because
of
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
be
on
what
might
be
call
the
casual
jobseeker
's
benefit
.
I
have
tab
a
number
of
parliamentary
question
to
the
minister
and
we
be
engage
with
she
and
some
of
she
official
on
this
.
person
be
find
themselves
on
what
could
be
the
wrong
category
of
payment
and
they
might
need
to
be
in
another
category
so
they
do
not
fall
off
a
social
welfare
entitlement
cliff
where
payment
might
cease
overnight
.
this
category
include
Aer
Lingus
worker
and
a
new
batch
of
worker
that
have
come
on
my
radar
in
the
past
48
hour
from
the
automotive
sector
.
this
be
the
Kostal
worker
in
north
Cork
,
Limerick
and
my
home
town
of
Mallow
.
this
worker
may
not
meet
the
criterion
set
out
in
current
policy
and
principle
that
determine
payment
.
this
be
all
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
working
week
be
still
Monday
to
Friday
but
there
should
be
some
change
to
the
system
to
have
regard
to
the
new
category
of
worker
emerge
in
society
who
present
for
social
protection
but
the
payment
cease
as
a
result
of
a
round
hole
with
a
square
peg
.
they
do
not
fit
a
category
and
be
,
therefore
,
kick
from
the
system
.
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
be
to
seek
to
put
in
place
system
so
individual
from
different
part
of
the
country
,
when
they
present
a
case
to
a
local
Intreo
office
,
do
not
get
conflicting
information
from
various
officer
because
a
system
can
be
put
in
place
to
"
triage
"
such
case
.
a
red
light
could
be
put
on
this
type
of
query
if
a
category
of
worker
be
encounter
difficulty
.
it
could
then
be
deal
with
up
the
line
in
a
timely
fashion
.
I
be
confident
the
two
category
of
worker
I
speak
of
will
be
deal
with
but
my
Bill
would
have
go
some
way
to
respond
to
that
type
of
scenario
.
I
do
not
intend
to
push
this
to
a
vote
and
I
accept
the
Minister
's
argument
and
bona
fide
about
work
with
deputy
on
all
side
of
the
House
when
matter
such
as
this
arise
.
if
deputy
Kerrane
's
very
innovative
proposal
be
take
up
,
we
would
support
it
.
if
that
emerge
from
my
Bill
fall
at
the
first
hurdle
,
I
would
not
see
it
as
a
pyrrhic
victory
.
we
would
still
progress
the
social
protection
system
as
a
whole
.
the
question
could
be
put
to
determine
if
the
minister
be
formally
oppose
the
Bill
on
second
stage

I
note
the
submission
to
the
Taoiseach
by
the
Irish
Air
Line
Pilot
's
Association
.
that
pilot
be
outside
this
building
today
and
we
stand
in
solidarity
with
they
.
they
refer
to
four
pillar
in
they
correspondence
to
the
Taoiseach
:
travel
within
the
common
travel
area
of
Ireland
and
the
UK
;
travel
within
the
European
Union
;
travel
between
Ireland
,
the
EU
and
the
Unite
State
of
America
;
and
the
application
of
rapid
antigen
testing
inbound
to
Ireland
to
safely
facilitate
the
other
three
pillar
.
in
she
statement
to
the
House
,
the
Minister
of
State
say
"
pcr
testing
for
international
travel
[
be
]
among
a
suite
of
public
health
measure
design
to
mitigate
this
risk
"
.
last
week
I
tell
the
minister
,
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
,
that
we
need
to
have
a
honest
debate
about
the
distinction
between
pcr
testing
and
antigen
testing
and
I
reiterate
that
.
we
need
to
have
a
honest
,
reasoned
and
scientific
debate
about
the
difference
between
pcr
testing
and
antigen
testing
.
if
the
pcr
test
become
the
prerequisite
for
the
digital
green
certificate
and
if
the
benchmark
be
that
people
have
to
be
vaccinate
,
test
and
recover
,
I
fear
that
,
subject
to
a
reason
and
rational
scientific
debate
of
this
House
,
many
family
will
be
exclude
from
travel
throughout
either
the
European
Union
or
elsewhere
.
the
issue
of
antigen
testing
have
to
be
part
of
the
debate
.
I
have
note
the
comment
from
we
colleague
in
Sinn
Féin
about
the
privatisation
of
Aer
Lingus
.
if
Sinn
Féin
be
propose
the
re-nationalisation
of
the
airline
,
we
would
all
be
very
happy
to
hear
whatever
proposal
it
might
have
on
that
issue
.
for
now
,
we
want
to
speak
for
Aer
Lingus
family
and
for
family
from
any
airline
.
there
be
family
in
Cork
at
the
moment
who
be
rely
wholly
on
payment
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
and
because
of
the
nature
of
they
work
and
how
they
hour
be
structure
annually
,
they
be
now
fall
off
a
cliff
.
they
be
get
no
more
money
from
the
Department
and
we
need
to
get
they
back
to
work
.
I
merely
wish
to
ask
the
minister
the
way
in
which
the
€
5
million
fund
to
support
the
development
of
Ireland
's
first
national
network
of
remote
working
hub
will
work
,
and
if
she
will
make
a
statement
on
the
matter
.
I
can
internalise
and
understand
where
the
minister
be
go
regard
the
connect
hub
fund
.
if
I
understand
it
correctly
,
she
be
refer
to
pre-exist
infrastructure
.
the
reason
I
ask
the
question
be
to
speak
for
people
in
place
such
as
Killavullen
and
Mitchelstown
in
north
Cork
,
for
example
,
from
where
I
have
receive
query
and
where
there
be
no
pre-exist
hub
.
this
situation
be
reflective
of
the
entire
country
really
.
the
people
ask
I
about
this
two
specific
location
be
wonder
if
they
can
get
a
slice
of
the
action
there
.
Mitchelstown
be
a
small
-
to
medium
-
size
town
while
Killavullen
be
a
village
where
connectivity
would
be
a
issue
.
can
people
who
live
in
area
where
there
be
currently
no
hub
reasonably
expect
that
they
will
get
a
slice
of
the
€5
million
?
I
thank
the
minister
.
what
she
be
clearly
articulate
to
I
,
so
that
I
can
report
back
to
the
people
who
have
make
representation
to
I
,
be
that
the
€
5
million
connect
hub
funding
do
not
apply
to
a
person
or
entity
try
to
start
from
scratch
and
that
it
be
for
pre-exist
infrastructure
.
this
be
what
the
minister
be
clarify
.
if
this
be
the
case
,
we
will
advise
accordingly
in
respect
of
location
where
people
want
to
create
something
in
the
community
where
people
can
come
together
in
appropriate
location
,
which
be
not
necessarily
community
facility
and
might
be
privately
own
facility
,
such
as
pub
,
for
instance
.
there
be
now
massive
potential
for
such
connectivity
and
bring
people
together
-
I
will
not
say
in
a
unorthodox
way
-
in
a
way
reimagine
what
the
local
pub
would
look
like
.
if
the
minister
be
tell
we
there
be
scope
for
connectivity
in
such
circumstance
we
would
welcome
it
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
co-operation
.
I

I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
co-operation
.
that
would
be
my
intention
.
I
wish
to
speak
for
people
who
be
live
in
private
rent
accommodation
throughout
this
State
,
much
of
which
be
substandard
.
many
of
this
people
be
on
local
authority
housing
list
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
overtly
political
about
this
or
seek
to
score
point
.
I
be
not
raise
this
issue
for
the
purpose
of
put
a
clip
up
on
Facebook
.
I
merely
wish
to
raise
the
matter
on
the
basis
of
the
increase
number
of
people
contact
I
who
be
live
in
what
can
be
only
describe
as
hovel
which
have
pass
muster
for
the
purpose
of
the
housing
assistance
payment
,
HAP
,
but
in
respect
of
which
there
do
not
appear
to
be
a
proper
inspection
regime
.
I
be
not
seek
to
apportion
blame
.
I
merely
wish
to
speak
for
this
people
.
in
one
instance
,
a
family
come
to
tell
I
about
mould
and
damp
on
the
wall
.
there
be
all
sort
of
public
health
issue
arise
from
that
,
with
child
present
with
severe
respiratory
illness
as
a
result
of
live
in
substandard
accommodation
.
if
the
inspection
regime
be
buttress
and
kick
-
start
,
that
would
help
the
situation
.
in
a
parliamentary
reply
to
my
colleague
,
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
,
in
respect
of
Cork
,
it
be
state
that
up
to
September
2020
there
be
611
inspection
carry
out
.
a
total
of
601
improvement
letter
be
issue
on
foot
of
that
inspection
.
similarly
,
up
to
September
2020
,
in
Cork
city
434
inspection
be
carry
out
,
96
improvement
letter
be
issue
and
one
improvement
notice
be
issue
.
the
local
authority
be
at
the
pin
of
they
collar
in
try
to
manage
this
service
.
it
be
unfair
to
expect
they
to
do
more
with
less
in
term
of
the
number
of
employee
who
be
task
with
this
job
,
in
respect
of
whole
-
time
equivalence
as
to
personnel
.
in
the
absence
of
a
adequate
supply
of
social
housing
stock
-
a
supply
issue
which
will
pertain
for
the
foreseeable
future
-
the
inspection
regime
should
be
robust
.
if
a
landlord
act
immorally
or
unethically
in
relation
to
he
or
she
tenant
,
and
do
not
meet
the
term
and
condition
of
the
legislation
as
lay
down
by
this
House
,
the
inspection
regime
should
be
robust
and
enforce
the
legislation
so
that
landlord
carry
out
they
obligation
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
reply
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
this
be
on
the
Department
's
agenda
in
the
context
of
provide
increase
funding
.
I
would
argue
,
however
,
that
while
a
increase
to
€
10
million
from
€
2.5
million
be
dramatic
,
when
one
factor
in
a
county
like
Cork
,
I
be
not
sure
how
far
€
10
million
would
go
if
it
be
extrapolate
out
across
all
county
.
I
ask
that
this
be
look
at
again
.
we
all
know
landlord
;
they
live
among
we
.
ninety
-
nine
per
cent
of
the
landlord
I
have
meet
be
very
good
and
decent
people
who
want
to
ensure
that
they
tenant
be
protect
and
that
they
live
in
accommodation
of
a
proper
standard
.
they
be
very
proud
of
the
fact
they
have
long
-
term
tenancy
and
agreement
with
letter
,
and
so
on
.
however
,
there
be
a
small
minority
who
I
would
describe
as
slum
landlord
.
in
one
instance
,
someone
approach
I
last
week
to
say
they
have
ask
for
a
simple
repair
and
be
tell
that
if
they
do
not
like
it
,
that
they
could
sling
they
hook
.
the
landlord
in
that
case
be
in
receipt
of
a
supplement
or
subvention
from
the
State
in
respect
of
the
property
involve
.
that
be
the
mere
point
.
there
be
a
moral
and
ethical
argument
here
in
the
context
of
tenant
who
cannot
get
local
authority
house
at
present
because
of
a
lack
of
supply
.
this
be
tenant
of
long
standing
.
some
be
happy
to
maintain
they
arrangement
if
the
repair
can
be
carry
out
.
there
need
to
be
a
follow
up
for
that
people
as
to
the
inspection
regime
.
I
be
very
conscious
that
we
be
in
this
pandemic
,
however
,
I
make
the
case
and
highlight
the
fact
that
the
inspection
regime
need
to
be
kick
-
start
as
soon
as
we
can
.
I
support
the
motion
and
congratulate
deputy
Nolan
and
she
colleague
on
bring
it
before
we
.
member
should
spare
a
thought
for
the
many
fisher
who
be
in
Cork
at
the
moment
.
a
flotilla
have
arrive
in
Cork
Harbour
.
I
wish
to
acknowledge
the
wonderful
way
in
which
they
have
organised
the
event
.
they
be
primary
producer
as
well
,
of
a
fashion
,
and
be
deserving
of
we
support
and
attention
.
I
hope
they
will
be
successful
in
they
travail
throughout
the
day
and
that
they
will
get
to
meet
the
Taoiseach
.
there
be
a
elephant
in
the
room
in
respect
of
beef
,
namely
,
the
current
negotiation
between
the
United
Kingdom
and
Australia
on
a
zero-
tariff
and
zero-quota
agreement
that
could
be
conclude
next
month
.
my
understanding
be
they
be
tee
it
up
for
the
G7
summit
in
Cornwall
.
I
be
fearful
about
that
deal
because
it
will
have
major
consequence
for
Irish
primary
producer
,
include
Irish
beef
and
sheep
farmer
.
if
the
deal
conclude
,
the
permutation
be
such
that
it
will
allow
Australia
to
ship
beef
and
lamb
without
tariff
to
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
I
be
really
concerned
about
how
that
will
impact
on
Irish
export
to
the
UK
.
notwithstanding
the
current
travail
in
respect
of
Brexit
,
I
be
fearful
that
the
conclusion
of
such
a
UK
-
Australia
free
trade
agreement
would
have
even
more
untold
and
negative
consequence
for
Irish
primary
producer
.
I
be
keen
to
hear
the
government
perspective
on
this
deal
and
what
kind
of
forward
planning
the
government
be
do
to
mitigate
the
effect
for
Irish
farmer
.
we
know
the
nature
of
farming
in
Australia
.
they
have
factory
farm
to
all
intent
and
purpose
.
if
they
be
able
to
export
to
the
UK
it
will
have
dire
consequence
for
Unite
Kingdom
farmer
and
for
Irish
farmer
.
we
wish
to
know
the
permutation
,
what
real
-
time
planning
be
take
place
and
what
mitigation
measure
the
government
will
undertake
to
ensure
Irish
farmer
be
support
.
if
there
be
a
significant
loss
of
income
and
loss
of
what
be
a
vital
market
,
what
be
the
government
do
to
offset
that
potential
loss
?
we
have
to
hear
from
government
on
its
plan
in
that
regard
.
it
be
a
vital
issue
and
one
deserving
of
attention
.
it
speak
to
the
heart
of
the
motion
before
we
today
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
market
access
to
China
.
will
the
minister
outline
the
status
of
export
beef
to
China
at
present
?
it
would
be
useful
to
know
the
value
in
euro
term
and
the
status
of
we
trading
relationship
with
China
at
present
in
respect
of
beef
export
.
it
be
a
grow
market
and
a
vital
one
,
give
the
primacy
of
Irish
beef
.
I
hope
we
will
not
be
lock
out
of
that
market
for
too
much
long
.
it
would
be
useful
for
Irish
farmer
in
the
export
game
to
know
the
status
of
that
market
.
it
would
be
useful
for
they
to
know
where
the
government
be
at
present
in
its
diplomatic
effort
to
restore
and
enhance
that
market
.
we
need
to
hear
from
the
government
in
respect
of
the
common
agricultural
Policy
.
we
know
that
many
farmer
will
farm
to
scheme
.
we
know
there
be
a
inevitability
about
the
fact
that
climate
action
measure
will
be
writ
large
across
the
next
cap
agreement
.
the
agreement
have
to
come
on
the
basis
of
ensure
financial
support
for
farmer
.
we
must
be
honest
about
this
.
if
there
be
to
be
a
incentive
provide
for
farmer
to
move
into
agri-environmental
scheme
support
by
the
Government
and
the
European
Union
,
then
there
need
to
be
clarity
on
what
that
mean
and
what
the
permutation
will
be
for
farm
income
.
I
refer
to
farm
income
for
the
type
of
farmer
we
be
discuss
today
,
namely
,
farmer
who
be
farming
on
a
marginal
income
and
who
be
wholly
dependent
on
a
market
price
.
they
will
need
continue
subvention
to
support
they
income
if
they
be
to
be
guardian
of
the
countryside
,
to
use
the
often
-
quote
phrase
.
incentive
will
have
to
be
provide
to
ensure
that
income
be
supplement
where
loss
of
income
be
perceive
or
project
.
I
will
speak
briefly
to
the
reality
of
where
the
market
be
at
present
.
I
understand
that
the
export
benchmark
price
that
be
negotiate
,
discuss
or
land
upon
in
the
context
of
the
beef
sector
agreement
be
currently
,
at
2020
price
,
approximately
€
3.55
per
kilo
.
I
be
tell
that
the
Bord
Bia
prime
cattle
price
for
export
be
approximately
€
3.56
,
or
effectively
1
cent
more
.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
the
minister
where
the
government
see
the
project
price
of
beef
be
one
year
from
now
,
take
CAP
and
the
UK
-
Australia
agreement
into
account
.
what
be
the
future
projection
and
what
plan
be
the
government
make
to
ensure
there
be
adequate
support
for
the
sector
and
individual
family
farm
?
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
amendment
no.

the
Labour
Party
be
very
disappointed
that
the
government
have
seek
to
defer
the
second
Reading
of
the
Bill
for
12
month
.
we
be
disappointed
because
for
thousand
of
people
throughout
the
State
the
acquisition
of
a
home
be
urgent
in
the
here
and
now
.
dress
up
the
deferment
of
this
legislation
,
which
arise
from
a
report
issue
48
year
ago
,
and
call
it
premature
because
it
be
at
variance
with
the
Law
Reform
Commission
's
consideration
of
the
Acquisition
of
Development
Land
(
Assessment
of
compensation
)
Bill
be
not
a
honest
argument
to
make
as
a
rebuttal
.
it
do
not
speak
for
the
people
who
anxiously
want
to
own
a
home
,
live
in
a
home
or
have
fixity
of
tenure
at
least
or
for
that
who
wish
to
be
able
to
rent
a
home
.
it
speak
volume
about
the
fact
that
,
from
a
ideological
point
of
view
,
this
government
and
its
component
part
still
believe
that
the
market
alone
will
deliver
housing
.
in
this
country
,
we
have
always
have
a
approach
whereby
the
State
could
provide
.
the
implementation
of
the
Kenny
report
be
one
mechanism
for
do
so
.
the
promulgation
of
this
legislation
,
which
many
people
accept
as
be
the
outworking
of
the
Kenny
report
and
its
recommendation
,
could
not
be
deem
or
adjudicate
to
be
premature
when
it
be
self
-
evident
,
with
many
thousand
of
people
wait
to
get
a
house
,
that
this
issue
be
urgent
and
need
to
be
deal
with
now
.
there
be
no
reason
the
government
could
not
support
this
legislation
now
,
allow
it
to
pass
second
stage
and
then
deal
with
all
the
issue
that
the
Minister
of
State
raise
in
he
contribution
.
the
view
of
the
Law
Reform
Commission
on
the
consolidation
of
compulsory
purchase
order
law
could
be
deal
with
easily
through
the
prism
of
this
legislation
.
it
could
be
do
now
rather
than
wait
for
12
month
.
it
could
be
deal
with
coterminous
with
the
government
's
housing
for
all
strategy
.
we
ask
the
government
to
reconsider
its
position
in
respect
of
we
humble
legislation
,
which
be
the
culmination
of
a
wait
of
48
year
.
we
have
be
try
for
some
time
to
promulgate
this
legislation
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
say
that
he
be
in
principle
in
agreement
with
it
,
I
do
not
see
why
it
could
not
pass
second
stage
at
this
point
.
all
the
issue
he
highlight
as
reason
it
cannot
proceed
could
be
debate
on
committee
stage
.
there
will
be
ample
time
in
the
come
12
month
,
as
oppose
to
go
beyond
12
month
,
to
deal
with
the
issue
the
Minister
of
State
have
outline
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
we
,
as
public
representative
,
be
deal
with
thousand
of
people
,
young
and
old
,
who
can
not
get
access
to
housing
.
they
cannot
build
house
or
purchase
house
in
they
locality
.
there
be
no
sense
of
a
timescale
for
when
they
will
see
house
on
the
horizon
.
the
national
planning
framework
be
have
the
effect
of
dezone
land
.
local
authority
,
like
my
local
authority
in
Cork
,
be
now
take
zone
land
out
of
the
equation
.
in
addition
,
Irish
Water
and
other
infrastructural
deficit
be
not
be
address
quickly
in
order
that
planning
permission
can
be
secure
and
we
can
house
the
people
we
represent
.
there
be
a
opportunity
in
the
here
and
now
to
address
the
issue
of
housing
.
it
be
the
issue
of
we
time
and
of
we
generation
of
politician
.
I
be
disappointed
that
the
Minister
of
State
have
come
to
we
with
this
response
.
I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
how
much
time
do
I
have
,
please
?
I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
very
much
.
I
be
grateful
for
the
half
.
I
will
start
by
alig
the
issue
of
the
CAP
negotiation
to
the
climate
action
and
low
carbon
development
(
amendment
)
Bill
2021
,
which
we
will
vote
upon
tonight
.
I
want
to
align
the
two
because
I
believe
they
be
absolutely
and
utterly
complementary
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
of
the
minister
's
perspective
on
what
climate
action
measure
or
type
of
scheme
he
envisage
will
be
put
in
place
arise
from
a
new
cap
.
what
kind
of
funding
mechanism
will
be
put
in
place
for
climate
action
?
before
my
second
question
,
let
I
first
make
a
political
point
in
that
we
completely
disagree
with
the
guillotining
of
this
Bill
this
evening
.
there
be
hundred
of
amendment
,
which
we
feel
strongly
should
have
be
address
.
more
time
should
have
be
give
,
for
instance
,
to
the
issue
of
the
elephant
in
the
room
,
that
be
,
the
biogenic
methane
issue
.
assurance
be
be
seek
by
the
farm
organisation
about
how
that
will
be
deal
with
in
respect
of
carbon
budget
.
be
the
minister
assure
that
the
climate
Bill
,
as
it
be
constitute
at
present
,
give
sufficient
coverage
to
farmer
such
that
any
measure
they
put
in
place
regard
climate
adaptation
or
mitigation
be
adequately
deal
with
in
this
Bill
?
I
suggest
to
the
minister
that
it
be
not
adequately
proof
so
that
one
can
take
into
account
the
measure
farmer
themselves
undertake
with
regard
to
offset
the
effect
of
biogenic
methane
.
that
be
something
on
which
we
need
clarity
.
I
will
come
back
in
if
I
have
time
.
I
genuinely
do
not
wish
to
put
the
minister
on
the
hook
but
all
that
of
we
who
will
support
the
climate
action
Bill
tonight
still
feel
strongly
that
not
enough
time
be
give
to
explore
issue
such
as
how
biogenic
methane
would
be
deal
with
,
regardless
of
which
side
of
the
argument
one
be
on
.
there
be
,
however
,
a
genuine
concern
on
the
part
of
farming
organisation
that
the
Bill
do
not
sufficiently
address
the
issue
of
biogenic
methane
in
respect
of
issue
like
sequestration
.
the
Labour
Party
,
for
example
,
propose
a
amendment
regard
afforestation
measure
where
we
be
seek
sectoral
adaptation
plan
so
that
one
would
clearly
define
what
the
target
on
afforestation
would
be
.
one
could
design
scheme
around
that
,
which
would
benefit
farmer
,
for
instance
.
I
be
tell
they
be
rule
out
of
order
because
it
would
be
a
cost
on
the
Revenue
.
for
that
of
we
who
be
try
to
think
laterally
-
without
be
too
rhetorical
about
it
-
we
still
have
to
grapple
with
the
issue
of
biogenic
methane
one
way
or
another
.
we
need
a
honest
debate
about
that
.
I
feel
strongly
that
it
be
important
it
be
allied
to
CAP
,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
pillar
in
respect
of
agri-environmental
type
scheme
that
will
be
come
down
the
track
.
there
would
have
be
time
within
the
climate
action
Bill
to
do
that
but
instead
the
government
tonight
be
guillotine
that
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
disrespectful
to
the
minister
but
I
do
not
think
I
be
satisfied
with
the
answer
he
have
give
in
he
response
on
biogenic
methane
.
we
remain
to
be
convinced
that
there
be
enough
within
the
legislation
as
it
be
constitute
presently
.
there
be
not
sufficient
wording
in
that
.
there
be
not
a
proper
locking
mechanism
in
it
that
address
the
concern
of
that
genuine
farmer
,
who
actually
want
to
be
involve
in
carbon
sequestration
,
carbon
adaptation
and
carbon
neutrality
,
but
do
not
feel
as
if
there
be
a
pathway
for
they
at
present
.
that
be
the
concern
I
be
try
to
address
here
.
there
be
30
second
leave
in
the
slot
for
the
minister
.
I
do
not
think
so
.
he
be
give
out
to
the
-----.
the
deputy
should
be
a
gentleman
and
acknowledge
that
he
misquot
deputy
Cairn
.
acknowledge
that
now
.
it
be
deputy
Cairn
you
misquot
.
you
should
take
it
back
,
address
it
to
the
deputy
and
be
a
gentleman
about
it
.
I
rise
to
support
amendment
no.
20
,
which
I
understand
be
in
this
grouping
.
the
reason
we
be
so
exercise
about
the
just
transition
be
that
we
all
,
from
we
various
perspective
,
feel
strongly
that
,
for
worker
in
the
sector
where
there
be
a
transition
to
be
make
,
that
transition
must
be
a
just
and
fair
one
.
the
State
should
recognise
that
by
ensure
a
funding
line
into
it
and
support
it
use
all
the
mechanism
of
the
State
that
can
be
employ
to
ensure
the
transition
take
place
in
a
fair
manner
.
I
refer
to
agriculture
in
particular
because
if
we
be
move
towards
this
transition
,
there
must
be
some
recognition
that
farmer
may
have
to
change
.
if
funding
line
such
as
scheme
and
support
through
CAP
or
the
European
Union
be
change
,
that
transition
must
be
make
as
just
and
fair
as
possible
.
person
involve
in
agriculture
must
be
part
of
that
process
.
they
need
to
feel
they
have
ownership
of
that
process
and
that
it
be
not
foist
upon
they
.
the
reason
I
be
so
exercise
about
the
de
facto
deletion
of
any
reference
to
just
transition
in
the
Bill
-
save
for
one
,
which
be
not
substantial
-
be
that
I
be
on
the
Joint
Committee
on
Climate
Action
with
the
current
minister
before
he
become
a
minister
.
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
,
as
he
be
at
the
time
,
play
a
massive
part
on
that
committee
and
people
like
I
support
the
ask
that
just
transition
be
reflect
in
the
report
arise
from
the
citizen
's
Assembly
deliberation
.
that
be
why
it
be
very
hard
to
understand
why
now
,
in
framework
legislation
,
there
be
no
reference
to
the
just
transition
or
any
substantial
definition
of
it
.
even
if
one
be
to
take
the
minister
at
face
value
about
the
legislation
he
be
promulgate
and
accept
that
there
will
be
sectoral
plan
deal
with
agriculture
,
transport
and
all
the
other
area
affect
by
climate
action
,
there
should
still
be
some
guide
definition
of
the
just
transition
.
then
,
in
agriculture
,
for
instance
,
when
devise
sectoral
action
plan
for
afforestation
,
the
principle
of
the
just
transition
would
have
to
be
apply
to
make
it
as
fair
as
possible
for
people
who
operate
in
that
sector
.
that
be
the
logic
of
the
amendment
on
the
just
transition
and
that
be
where
we
be
come
from
.
I
cannot
understand
why
the
minister
have
take
such
a
stern
line
on
this
issue
.
it
be
something
the
Green
Party
put
forward
in
its
own
just
transition
Bill
when
in
opposition
.
I
do
not
understand
why
it
be
demur
or
withdraw
from
it
now
.
we
have
not
hear
from
the
minister
what
he
plan
be
regard
this
issue
.
we
put
down
amendment
on
afforestation
target
because
year
after
year
,
we
be
miss
target
on
afforestation
.
we
have
hear
about
this
chapter
and
verse
.
deputy
Fitzmaurice
be
one
of
the
strong
voice
on
forestry
licence
in
this
Dáil
and
we
have
always
support
he
when
it
come
to
the
plight
of
people
in
the
forestry
sector
.
I
be
deal
with
case
relate
to
that
issue
in
my
own
constituency
.
my
point
be
that
if
we
have
a
proper
target
for
afforestation
and
a
proper
,
fit
-
for
-
purpose
forestry
service
to
enable
forestry
licence
for
fell
and
grow
to
be
procure
in
a
timely
fashion
,
that
would
feed
into
this
climate
agenda
.
it
be
not
be
consider
in
this
legislation
,
because
I
be
be
tell
the
idea
of
have
a
sectoral
target
for
afforestation
be
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
.
this
be
the
new
tool
now
be
use
for
legislative
purpose
to
block
amendment
.
I
understand
the
ruling
of
the
chair
of
the
committee
and
I
always
abide
by
that
ruling
,
as
I
do
by
that
ruling
make
by
the
Ceann
Comhairle
,
because
I
respect
parliamentary
tradition
and
the
rule
lay
down
by
this
House
.
however
,
there
come
a
time
when
it
be
necessary
to
push
back
against
what
I
call
a
tool
be
use
to
block
what
we
consider
very
effective
and
genuine
amendment
to
encourage
the
planting
of
more
tree
and
feed
into
this
agenda
more
effectively
.
when
seek
to
amend
the
legislation
to
that
effect
,
though
,
we
be
tell
that
there
will
be
a
charge
on
the
Revenue
to
have
a
sectoral
plan
.
that
defy
logic
in
my
book
.
I
think
today
be
Bloomsday
.
I
be
not
a
Joycean
scholar
by
any
manner
or
means
,
but
I
think
we
would
all
have
admire
Nora
Barnacle
for
the
way
in
which
she
be
able
to
marshal
Mr.
Joyce
.
one
day
,
she
ask
he
why
he
would
not
write
book
that
people
can
read
.
I
think
that
sentiment
would
appeal
to
some
of
we
here
.
we
might
not
be
Joycean
scholar
,
but
we
can
certainly
appreciate
the
global
impact
James
Joyce
have
in
respect
of
Irish
literature
.
it
be
not
,
however
,
to
everybody
's
taste
.
in
the
same
vein
,
I
ask
the
minister
to
write
legislation
that
everybody
can
read
,
write
in
the
just
transition
element
as
a
abide
principle
and
then
work
through
all
the
sectoral
plan
.

the
Labour
Party
support
the
motion
.
I
want
to
raise
some
issue
in
respect
of
the
Pension
Commission
,
which
the
Minister
of
State
have
speak
extensively
about
.
we
be
strike
by
the
IBEC
submission
.
one
of
its
key
recommendation
call
on
the
government
to
remove
the
necessity
to
objectively
justify
a
post
-
retirement
fix
-
term
contract
.
we
believe
that
this
be
a
retrograde
step
that
would
give
employer
the
green
light
to
discriminate
against
worker
on
the
grounds
of
age
.
while
plenty
of
stick
and
stone
be
throw
at
the
Labour
Party
about
we
time
in
government
,
we
must
remember
that
it
be
a
Labour
Party
minister
of
State
,
my
colleague
,
deputy
Aodhán
Ó
Ríordáin
,
who
introduce
vital
legislation
in
2015
to
protect
work
people
and
bring
law
to
prevent
age
discrimination
in
line
with
European
case
law
.
we
must
protect
the
provision
set
out
in
section
6
(
3
)
(
c
)
of
the
employment
Equality
act
at
all
cost
.
this
vital
legislation
prohibit
employer
from
"
offer
"
a
post
-
retirement
fix
-
term
contract
without
any
requirement
to
objectively
justify
it
.
it
be
vital
that
be
protect
.
a
move
though
to
row
back
on
this
or
amend
this
legislation
,
as
some
be
call
for
-
I
hope
the
government
will
resist
that
call
-
would
set
back
worker
's
rights
and
equality
rights
by
decade
,
which
would
be
unacceptable
.
the
reality
be
that
many
worker
wish
to
remain
in
they
employment
until
at
least
they
state
pension
become
payable
due
to
they
continue
ability
to
do
they
job
and
that
they
would
see
a
significant
drop
in
they
income
if
force
to
retire
.
the
recently
introduce
benefit
payment
do
not
address
this
issue
.
let
we
call
a
spade
a
spade
here
and
be
honest
with
each
other
about
the
debate
that
we
be
have
tonight
about
the
benefit
payment
.
it
do
not
address
the
issue
.
address
this
issue
require
legislative
change
.
the
employment
Equality
Act
1998
to
2015
state
that
a
employer
cannot
discriminate
against
a
worker
on
the
grounds
of
age
.
the
act
allow
,
but
crucially
do
not
require
,
employer
to
set
a
mandatory
retirement
age
for
worker
provide
it
can
objectively
be
justify
by
legitimate
aim
.
therefore
,
where
we
have
legislation
which
allow
for
worker
to
be
retire
by
a
particular
age
,
it
will
not
be
regard
as
age
discrimination
if
it
be
objectively
justify
by
a
legitimate
aim
.
however
,
such
a
aim
most
include
legitimate
employment
policy
,
labour
market
and
training
objective
for
it
to
be
in
line
with
the
EU
's
directive
on
equal
treatment
in
employment
and
occupation
.
that
be
the
law
.
that
be
where
we
be
and
there
can
be
no
go
back
on
that
.
this
decision
must
be
justify
rather
than
the
decision
of
individual
employer
.
the
Labour
Party
believe
that
be
miss
from
tonight
's
motion
,
although
it
address
it
to
a
certain
extent
.
as
well
-
mean
as
it
be
,
it
fall
short
on
a
crucial
element
the
Stop67
campaigner
be
call
for
,
which
be
a
statutory
right
to
remain
in
the
job
.
we
be
support
the
motion
.
I
listen
very
carefully
to
the
Sinn
Féin
contributor
to
the
debate
.
De
facto
,
Sinn
Féin
be
call
for
the
retirement
age
to
move
to
65
.
I
do
not
think
there
be
any
ambiguity
about
that
.
that
be
my
understanding
of
it
.
the
motion
state
in
the
first
line
that
"
worker
in
the
State
make
a
considerable
tax
contribution
throughout
they
work
life
and
should
have
the
right
to
access
the
full
pension
rate
of
payment
when
they
retire
at
age
65
"
.
in
other
word
,
it
want
to
move
the
retirement
age
from
66
down
to
65
.
the
final
Sinn
Féin
speaker
might
clarify
this
for
we
.
the
motion
call
on
the
government
to
"
commit
to
restore
the
State
pension
Transition
payment
for
that
retire
at
65
year
of
age
"
.
I
may
be
misinterpret
the
motion
but
I
ask
for
clarification
.
if
the
motion
be
call
for
the
retirement
age
to
be
reduce
to
65
,
I
imagine
it
negate
the
need
for
the
State
pension
transition
payment
to
be
reintroduce
at
65
year
of
age
.
however
,
I
may
be
miss
some
logic
there
.
we
support
the
motion
and
we
support
the
work
of
the
Pension
Commission
.
we
need
to
be
cognisant
of
what
be
already
in
law
.
when
the
Pension
Commission
make
its
final
deliberation
,
hopefully
it
will
not
recommend
any
unwinding
of
pre-exist
law
particularly
in
respect
of
argument
Stop67
have
so
stridently
put
forward
,
and
which
we
have
all
adhere
to
.
the
employment
Equality
act
be
exist
robust
legislation
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
fix
-
term
contract
be
deal
with
properly
in
the
context
of
the
Pension
Commission
.
we
all
wait
with
anticipation
for
the
report
of
that
commission
.
ultimately
,
it
will
be
for
this
House
to
decide
where
it
go
thereafter
.
the
Labour
Party
be
set
out
its
stall
tonight
in
respect
of
post
-
retirement
fix
-
term
contract
because
we
believe
that
issue
will
be
very
high
on
the
agenda
.
we
support
the
motion
;
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
that
.
I
just
want
to
raise
a
minute
,
but
significant
issue
on
the
benefit
payment
.
the
application
process
can
be
cumbersome
for
some
people
.
on
15
June
I
ask
the
minister
if
she
would
make
the
form
for
the
benefit
payment
for
65
-
year
-
old
available
to
download
and
print
,
rather
than
on
request
only
.
the
minister
respond
to
say
that
people
can
apply
online
,
which
be
fine
and
many
people
will
apply
online
.
for
that
not
able
to
apply
online
,
the
alternative
be
to
make
a
request
to
the
local
Intreo
office
or
through
the
Department
's
income
-
support
helpline
and
it
be
post
to
the
applicant
.
if
the
form
could
be
available
online
for
people
to
print
it
off
and
make
they
application
it
would
help
a
significant
number
of
people
.
it
be
a
relatively
minor
issue
.
we
do
not
understand
the
logic
of
not
be
able
to
print
off
the
form
itself
.
however
,
a
significant
cohort
of
people
be
not
able
to
do
that
at
the
moment
.
I
would
be
very
grateful
if
that
could
be
consider
.
deputy
Ellis
raise
important
point
,
particularly
about
send
out
notification
and
effective
communication
.
that
point
be
important
for
Irish
Water
to
take
on
board
.
the
Water
Service
Act
place
specific
responsibility
on
the
Minister
and
the
Department
of
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
,
include
responsibility
for
matter
relevant
to
water
policy
,
funding
and
in
the
making
of
regulation
.
the
water
service
act
also
put
in
place
a
variety
of
legislative
and
regulatory
control
to
ensure
governance
,
oversight
and
accountability
regard
water
service
.
Irish
Water
be
subject
to
significant
regulation
and
oversight
from
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
,
EPA
,
relate
to
environmental
compliance
and
the
CRU
,
relate
to
economic
regulation
,
include
customer
service
.
the
Oireachtas
also
establish
the
Water
Advisory
Body
to
report
to
the
Oireachtas
on
Irish
Water
's
performance
.
for
example
,
regard
the
major
boil
water
notice
arise
from
problem
at
the
Leixlip
water
treatment
plant
in
2019
,
the
CRU
carry
out
a
audit
of
the
Irish
Water
response
to
check
compliance
with
the
standard
lay
down
in
the
customer
service
handbook
.
this
audit
be
also
available
on
the
CRU
website
.
as
I
have
outline
,
Irish
Water
assure
my
Department
that
it
make
every
effort
to
deliver
on
its
responsibility
,
to
keep
service
interruption
to
the
minimum
extent
possible
,
as
well
as
to
comply
with
its
obligation
under
the
customer
service
handbook
when
communicate
with
customer
.
I
note
the
point
make
by
deputy
Ellis
.
as
I
say
,
we
can
always
improve
on
the
communication
and
on
the
level
of
service
provide
to
the
public
.
on
the
point
raise
about
McKee
Avenue
,
Finglas
,
I
understand
that
the
burst
water
main
have
now
be
repair
.
it
be
probably
the
initial
query
bring
forward
by
deputy
Ellis
.
I
thank
he
for
bring
this
issue
forward
this
evening
.
the
Labour
Party
be
support
the
Bill
.
we
wonder
why
it
be
be
kick
to
touch
for
the
period
of
time
that
be
propose
by
the
government
,
which
be
unnecessary
.
there
be
ample
time
to
deal
with
all
of
the
section
in
the
Bill
through
Committee
stage
.
any
of
the
concern
that
have
be
raise
by
the
government
,
through
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
,
could
be
deal
with
through
the
parliamentary
process
.
this
could
be
do
in
the
normal
course
of
event
.
the
Bill
be
worthy
of
support
.
it
be
measure
and
it
simply
give
retire
worker
access
to
the
Workplace
Relation
Commission
in
situation
where
they
pension
scheme
be
be
change
,
which
be
not
unreasonable
.
they
currently
have
no
representation
.
there
be
a
definite
gap
in
the
law
because
it
allow
unscrupulous
business
owner
to
make
million
in
profit
while
leave
pension
fund
underfunded
,
which
be
one
example
.
we
have
meet
group
of
public
sector
retiree
who
have
very
legitimate
grievance
.
old
public
sector
worker
do
not
pay
regular
prsi
and
do
not
have
a
entitlement
to
the
State
pension
,
so
they
do
not
benefit
from
budget

there

group
like
that
,
which
be
support
the
promulgation
of
this
legislation
,
have
legitimacy
.
it
be
important
to
recognise
the
legitimacy
of
this
cohort
of
people
and
all
of
the
stakeholder
who
be
support
this
Bill
because
they
represent
ten
of
thousand
of
worker
.
that
need
to
be
acknowledge
.
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
the
large
stakeholder
grouping
do
not
attach
to
one
political
party
or
ideological
association
and
,
in
fact
,
I
suggest
that
very
many
of
this
worker
would
have
traditionally
vote
for
Fianna
Fáil
and
Fine
Gael
.
that
be
why
we
feel
strongly
that
the
Bill
should
progress
through
the
dáil
at
this
stage
.
this
be
a
broad
coalition
of
stakeholder
that
reflect
what
be
happen
in
society
.
person
have
a
real
-
time
loss
of
income
and
they
merely
wish
to
have
representation
and
for
that
representation
to
be
recognise
in
law
.
that
be
not
unreasonable
.
cynically
,
one
could
say
that
,
like
any
issue
that
affect
a
historical
cohort
,
there
be
a
reflex
within
the
government
and
sometimes
within
the
Civil
Service
,
dare
I
say
it
,
and
I
say
it
be
a
former
minister
of
State
,
to
hold
tight
because
the
calculation
be
that
this
generation
will
pass
on
and
,
as
the
issue
do
not
affect
middle
aged
or
young
people
,
the
government
will
try
to
put
it
on
the
long
finger
.
I
speak
with
objectivity
because
that
be
precisely
what
be
happen
with
this
legislation
.
it
be
be
put
on
the
long
finger
and
it
be
a
de
facto
attempt
by
the
government
to
kill
it
off
in
the
long
run
.
I
do
not
think
that
be
to
anybody
's
benefit
,
particularly
give
the
range
and
breadth
of
the
stakeholder
group
that
be
involved
in
support
the
legislation
.
they
be
reflective
of
all
sector
of
society
.
we
must
always
remember
that
the
principle
of
intergenerational
solidarity
have
to
apply
.
there
must
be
that
solidarity
between
retire
former
worker
and
current
worker
,
and
this
Bill
seek
to
support
that
principle
.
we
strongly
support
the
Bill
and
we
ask
that
the
government
revise
its
decision
to
delay
its
passage
.
we
ask
the
government
,
in
principle
,
to
stop
use
this
tool
.
it
use
to
be
the
guillotine
and
now
it
be
the
six
-
month
or
12
-
month
delay
tactic
that
be
be
use
as
the
effective
tool
of
government
to
stymie
legislation
that
be
propose
by
member
on
the
Opposition
bench
.
to
be
frank
,
the
ten
of
thousand
of
worker
,
who
be
watch
this
proceedings
in
the
hope
that
the
government
would
at
least
allow
the
Bill
to
pass
second
stage
and
go
to
Committee
Stage
,
so
all
of
the
issue
raise
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
,
can
be
address
,
see
the
tactic
for
what
it
be
.
let
we
call
a
spade
a
spade
:
it
be
a
attempt
by
the
government
to
kick
the
can
down
the
line
and
kill
it
off
,
if
it
can
.
I
do
not
think
people
will
be
too
enamoured
with
Fianna
Fáil
,
Fine
Gael
and
the
Green
Party
for
employ
this
tactic
.
they
will
see
it
for
what
it
be
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
second
Stage
of
the
Industrial
Relation
(
provision
in
respect
of
Pension
Entitlement
of
retired
worker
)
Bill
2021
,
which
take
place
this
morning
.
on
the
question
,
"
that
the
amendment
to
the
motion
be
make
"
,
a
division
be
claim
,
and
in
accordance
with
Standing
Order
80
(
2
)
,
that
division
must
be
take
now
.
on
the
same
theme
,
I
merely
wish
to
ask
the
minister
the
exact
status
of
the
propose
public
tendering
of
local
employment
scheme
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
there
be
still
concern
,
particularly
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
have
be
work
in
the
system
?
one
person
I
know
have
be
work
in
the
system
for
over
25
year
.
I
share
the
concern
raise
.
it
have
be
express
to
I
that
if
a
person
who
be
a
client
of
the
service
do
not
reach
a
certain
metric
or
if
there
be
not
a
certain
output
in
that
person
's
case
,
perhaps
the
attainment
of
a
full
-
time
or
part
-
time
job
or
whatever
that
output
might
be
,
a
punitive
economic
measure
or
sanction
could
be
levy
against
the
person
or
client
.
that
be
a
concern
that
people
have
.
they
be
concerned
that
the
net
effect
of
the
creation
of
a
new
service
will
be
that
a
set
of
metric
will
be
put
in
place
which
specify
that
the
client
have
to
reach
certain
milestone
and
if
they
do
not
reach
that
milestone
,
payment
or
other
service
will
be
cut
off
from
the
client
.
we
be
yet
to
be
convince
.
I
say
that
respectfully
.
the
minister
have
acknowledge
that
she
predecessor
attend
the
Irish
local
Development
Network
,
ILDN
,
conference
in
2018
.
I
request
that
the
minister
consider
meet
the
ILDN
and
trade
union
representative
follow
the
outcome
of
the
first
request
for
tender
process
and
before
the
second
request
for
tender
process
begin
.
I
be
make
that
request
because
I
believe
there
will
be
learning
from
the
first
request
for
tender
process
.
the
minister
state
previously
to
deputy
Kerrane
that
she
official
have
meet
various
representative
group
.
if
the
minister
would
consider
personally
meet
trade
union
representative
and
the
ILDN
,
that
would
be
welcome
.
the
employer
and
union
be
on
the
same
page
,
in
this
instance
.
I
share
the
concern
deputy
Calleary
outline
about
the
risk
that
we
feel
be
inherent
in
this
that
the
outcome
of
the
negotiation
will
be
such
that
the
amount
pay
to
retiree
would
be
derisory
,
rendering
the
process
almost
null
and
void
in
the
context
of
the
pound
of
flesh
that
supervisor
have
give
through
they
year
of
service
.
the
government
should
not
at
the
end
of
this
process
be
level
with
the
charge
that
it
be
a
token
process
.
the
process
have
to
be
such
that
the
amount
of
money
that
will
be
award
to
people
will
be
commensurate
with
they
year
of
service
and
meaningful
for
that
people
.
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
Minister
in
the
Department
and
accept
the
fact
that
there
be
a
process
to
be
go
through
in
respect
of
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
but
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
ensure
that
the
money
that
be
pay
at
the
end
of
the
day
will
be
meaningful
give
the
supervisor
's
year
of
service
.
we
know
this
people
.
they
live
within
we
community
and
we
know
the
work
they
do
.
we
deal
with
they
every
day
of
the
week
.
they
be
of
we
and
we
neighbour
.
the
work
they
do
cannot
be
measure
easily
in
metric
but
we
all
know
instinctively
its
value
,
sometimes
over
decade
in
the
case
of
some
supervisor
.
I
reiterate
the
call
that
have
be
make
that
the
process
and
outcome
have
to
be
meaningful
in
term
of
financial
recognition
of
that
service
.
all
of
we
in
the
political
landscape
openly
acknowledge
the
role
of
community
employment
scheme
.
we
recognise
the
value
that
they
have
bring
to
the
public
realm
and
otherwise
.
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
if
the
outcome
of
this
process
be
such
that
people
feel
they
personal
dignity
,
as
worker
,
be
undermine
by
a
derisory
package
.
I
implore
the
Minister
of
State
,
and
I
know
he
will
take
this
into
account
,
to
reflect
that
work
in
a
package
that
be
commensurate
with
year
of
service
.
I
thank
deputy
Pringle
.
he
be

quite
adept

I
might

look
for
one

while
I
have
the
floor
,
I
beg
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
indulgence
on
a
small
matter
of
etiquette
and
good
manners
.
I
notice
over
the
summer
period
the
number
of
minister
-
Fianna
Fáil
Minister
in
particular
-
who
have
be
traverse
the
country
and
avail
of
opportunity
to
visit
constituency
.
a
number
of
they
visit
my
constituency
and
I
be
happy
to
see
they
there
,
but
they
do
not
extend
the
courtesy
of
notify
all
Member
of
the
Oireachtas
when
they
visit
constituency
.
I
would
not
call
it
a
protocol
but
there
be
a
convention
of
etiquette
and
good
manners
such
that
minister
at
least
notify
all
member
of
the
Oireachtas
when
they
be
visit
constituency
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
welcome
that
the
new
regulatory
body
,
MARA
,
will
be
set
up
in
Wexford
town
.
it
will
be
a
fine
location
for
the
regulatory
body
and
key
personnel
.
I
would
like
to
make
the
case
for
Cork
in
term
of
the
servicing
of
offshore
renewable
energy
.
the
deepwater
port
of
the
low
harbour
would
be
a
excellent
key
national
reference
point
for
such
servicing
.
there
be
many
point
along
the
Atlantic
seaboard
that
would
be
appropriate
for
that
purpose
and
we
can
all
work
and
coalesce
with
each
other
on
that
agenda
.
we
be
very
conscious
that
the
EU
strategy
on
offshore
renewable
energy
have
key
target
and
there
be
a
massive
opportunity
in
that
.
we
know
we
will
need
27
GW
of
offshore
wind
to
meet
we
zero-
carbon
target
by
2050
.
put
that
into
perspective
,
Moneypoint
power
station
generate
approximately
850
mw
.
the
opportunity
be
there
in
term
of
offshore
generation
.
there
be
question
inherent
in
this
legislation
that
have
yet
to
be
answer
in
regard
to
the
offshore
opportunity
.
we
know
that
wind
will
provide
a
source
for
decarbonisation
.
we
know
it
must
come
from
float
offshore
wind
on
the
south
and
west
coast
because
traditional
fix
-
bottom
offshore
technology
be
only
for
shallow
water
such
as
that
of
the
Irish
Sea
,
which
give
limited
space
and
capacity
for
the
development
at
scale
that
be
need
.
we
must
start
now
by
ensure
that
float
wind
project
contribute
to
the
target
of
5
GW
of
offshore
wind
by
2030
.
starting
now
mean
we
can
begin
to
develop
the
supply
chain
,
include
at
port
such
as
Cork
,
in
order
that
float
wind
platform
can
be
deploy
from
Irish
port
up
to
and
beyond
the
2030
.
a
major
constraint
on
start
now
and
secure
the
benefit
of
float
wind
for
Ireland
stem
from
the
uncertainty
from
government
on
how
the
sector
will
be
progress
in
the
short
,
medium
and
long
term
.
the
forthcoming
climate
action
plan
should
have
a
target
for
float
wind
.
will
the
minister
tell
we
whether
this
have
be
address
?
how
will
he
ensure
the
legislation
cater
for
float
wind
development
?
in
order
for
float
wind
project
to
contribute
to
we
2030
target
,
developer
need
to
be
survey
at
sea
next
spring
or
summer
.
if
developer
have
to
wait
for
the
new
regulatory
authority
to
be
set
up
,
which
could
take
up
to
18
month
from
the
passing
of
the
Bill
,
they
could
miss
the
boat
.
how
will
the
minister
ensure
float
wind
developer
can
achieve
permission
to
survey
outside
of
the
12
nautical
mile
zone
in
2022
?
the
maritime
area
planning
legislation
be
a
major
reform
,
as
we
know
,
but
Ireland
have
be
sea
-
blind
for
too
many
decade
at
this
stage
.
that
be
evident
to
everyone
here
.
we
want
to
ensure
the
industry
can
scale
up
and
scale
out
.
that
permission
for
survey
need
to
be
give
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
should
be
address
within
this
legislation
.
we
be
call
on
the
minister
to
provide
that
consent
in
advance
of
the
regulatory

be
set
up
in
Wexford
.
I
thank
the
Deputy

this
sector
,
like
many
sector
of
the
economy
,
be
come
out
of
a
incredibly
difficult
time
follow
Covid
.
it
be
a
sector
that
certainly
step
up
during
the
crisis
,
which
both
Deputy
recognise
,
particularly
last
January
when
it

not

but
continue
to
provide
early

and
care
for
the
most
vulnerable
child
and
the

,
EWSS
,
and
the

exemption
for
childcare
that
I
negotiate
with
the
Department
of
Finance
at
the
time
because
we
know
,
with
the
pod
arrangement
,
that

have
a
obligation
to
have
more

,
which
require
great
funding
.
we
provide
that
through
the
EWSS
.
all
the

I
have
meet
have
recognise
how
important
that
support
be
up
to
this
point
.
they
also
recognise
that
we
have
be
very
clear
there
will
not

in

of
the

that
the

be
the
opportunity
to
move
we
beyond

to

that

will
not
come
as
a

to

on

day
they
be
publish
in

.
I
have
be
engage
with
the
group
and
I
have
a
sense
of
the
key
element
.
everyone
in
the
sector
have
a
sense
of
that
key
element
and
they
will
form
the
basis
of
my
engagement
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
and
my
other
government
colleague
in
the
context
of

it
be
essential
,
as
deputy
Murnane
O'Connor
say
,
that
we
provide

it
require

move
on
through

one
of
the
most
depressing
thing
for
I
in
this

be
talk
to
a

I

well
,
a
young

who
have
just
graduate
from
a
third

institution

who
leave
the

after
work
in

three
month
because
the
pay
be
so
bad

we
must
give
people
like
she
a
future
in

the

the

be
take

do
that

it
be
a

certainly
step
up
during

which
both

particularly
last

how

the

a

the

be
take
will
do
that
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
government
be
not
oppose
this
Bill
.
I
note
the
government
have
say
there
may
be
some
legal
issue
inherent
in
the
Bill
and
there
may
be
challenge
.
we
job
here
be
to
promulgate
legislation
and
work
through
it
.
if
issue
arise
in
the
court
thereafter
,
then
so
be
it
,
but
we
be
the
Legislature
.
I
wish
to
goodness
the
government
would
not
qualify
its
support
for
the
passage
of
a
Bill
by
come
out
with
language
such
as
that
.
it
be
a
culture
that
have
pervade
this
House
in
latter
year
.
we
should
proceed
on
a
issue
such
as
this
in
a
bipartisan
or
non-partisan
manner
and
seek
to
work
through
any
legal
issue
that
be
always
euphemistically
refer
to
.
we
strongly
support
give
rights
to
renter
.
that
be
what
this
be
about
,
fundamentally
.
we
be
all
inundate
with
call
from
constituent
who
find
themselves
in
challenging
position
,
include
that
live
in
substandard
,
Dickensian
residence
-
one
would
not
even
call
they
"
residence
"
-
and
people
who
be
try
to
get
on
the
first
rung
of
the
housing
ladder
.
we
be
make
a
honest
attempt
to
promulgate
legislation
which
would
seek
to
give
a
great
balance
to
the
renter
,
as
my
colleague
,
deputy
Bacik
,
say
.
it
remind
I
of
Michael
Davitt
and
the
Land
League
.
some
170
year
ago
,
Davitt
speak
of
fixity
of
tenure
and
fair
rent
.
when
it
come
to
renter
and
citizen
we
be
talk
about
the
same
principle
.
it
behove
we
all
to
try
to
legislate
effectively
so
that
we
shift
the
balance
and
there
be
a
paradigm
shift
away
from
the
market
and
towards
the
renter
,
allow
for
people
to
live
happily
and
affordably
in
they
own
home
if
they
be
not
owner
-
occupier
of
property
.
the
inspection
regime
by
local
authority
need
to
be
kick
-
start
again
.
I
understand
it
go
into
abeyance
during
lockdown
for
obvious
reason
but
there
be
people
in
receipt
of
the
housing
assistance
payment
,
hap
,
and
rental
accommodation
scheme
,
ras
,
payment
live
in
accommodation
support
by
the
State
that
be
completely
substandard
and
not
fit
for
anybody
to
live
in
.
that
inspection
regime
need
to
be
up
and
run
again
.
it
be
vital
.
the
Library
and
Research
Service
,
LRS
,
digest
have
be
very
useful
for
many
of
we
because
it
have
encapsulate
many
of
the
concern
that
have
be
bring
to
we
attention
.
as
member
will
know
,
it
have
issue
a
paper
in
response
to
the
Bill
.
certainly
,
many
issue
be
raise
in
respect
of
the
Bill
at
pre-legislative
scrutiny
,
PLS
,
stage
,
which
must
be
sufficiently
address
by
the
government
.
in
table
2
of
the
LRS
digest
,
it
have
supply
a
traffic
light
dashboard
compare
the
Bill
as
publish
to
the
committee
's
pls
recommendation
.
I
will
highlight
four
key
issue
inherent
in
the
Bill
and
quote
directly
from
the
report
.
the
first
issue
,
per
the
committee
report
,
be
:
Questionable
fairness
of
allocate
point
system
.
the
standard
of
proof
require
threshold
be
base
upon
balance
of
probability
rather
than
culpability
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
.
in
they
PLS
the
Joint
Committee
identify
the
potentially
problematic
nature
of
a
determination
panel
conclude
on
the
balance
of
probability
as
evidence
by
the
report
of
the
Authority
,
rather
than
a
threshold
for
proof
require
.
all
allege
serious
infringement
be
make
by
means
of
a
write
report
by
the
Authority
.
section
6
of
the
Bill
provide
that
a
determination
panel
will
be
establish
for
the
purpose
of
determine
whether
a
serious
infringement
have
occur
and
whether
a
person
be
,
at
the
time
,
the
master
of
the
sea
-
fishing
boat
.
in
address
a
appeal
process
,
a
appeal
officer
will
be
assign
at
the
Authority
.
a
time
period
of
30
day
be
available
in
which
to
submit
to
the
appeal
officer
.
the
appeal
must
be
in
writing
,
by
the
master
and
be
subject
to
a
fee
(
to
be
determine
)
.
the
issue
raise
by
the
committee
be
that
"
the
Bill
do
not
address
concern
regard
the
'
balance
of
probability
's
provide
the
require
threshold
of
proof
,
nor
how
exist
report
and
/
or
point
may
or
may
not
be
consider
in
the
Authority
's
assessment
of
further
allege
infringement
.
"
that
be
the
first
issue
.
the
second
issue
be
the
weighing
of
fishery
product
in
-
factory
.
the
committee
's
PLS
report
-
and
I
quote
again
from
the
digest
-
state
"
the
Bill
as
publish
do
not
cover
or
address
this
issue
.
"
the
third
issue
be
the
application
of
penalty
point
to
EU
and
non-EU
vessel
.
there
be
"
particular
concern
that
UK
vessel
in
Irish
water
be
advantaged
"
.
accord
to
the
digest
:
the
Bill
do
not
provide
for
assign
penalty
point
to
or
have
a
register
of
point
assign
to
foreign
national
.
instead
,
a
provision
in
section
6
(
15i
)
include
that
point
assign
to
a
foreign
master
will
be
notify
in
write
to
the
relevant
authority
of
the
relevant
Member
State
.
the
UK
be
not
specify
.
thus
the
Bill
do
not
provide
for
the
Authority
deal
with
serious
infringement
by
UK

I
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
N73
.
the
N73
be
a
national
secondary
route
.
at
present
it
could
be
consider
no
more
than
a
local
road
in
term
of
how
it
have
be
treat
in
investment
term
.
the
route
will
take
you
from
west
of
Mallow
to
Rathmore
and
on
up
north
,
through
Mallow
and
on
into
Mitchelstown
.
there
be
a
part
of
the
road
,
from
Clogher
Cross
to
Waterdyke
or
,
as
we
know
it
locally
,
Canteen
Cross
,
and
also
at
Annakisha
South
where
,
up
to
now
,
for
this
year
alone
,
through
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
,
TII
,
€
1.5
million
have
be
spend
to
bring
the
process
to
tender
to
enable
work
to
be
carry
out
on
approximately
3
kilometer
of
road
.
I
be
give
to
understand
that
Cork
County
Council
and
TII
have
do
all
the
preparatory
work
on
this
.
all
we
be
ask
for
be
€
10
million
to
make
this
road
safe
.
it
be
currently
unsafe
.
when
heavy
goods
vehicle
pass
each
other
on
the
road
,
they
have
to
slow
down
to
a
stop
in
order
to
pass
because
there
be
no
verge
on
the
road
and
you
have
to
traverse
the
white
line
in
order
to
pass
at
certain
section
on
the
road
if
you
be
drive
a
heavy
goods
vehicle
.
the
road
be
a
important
road
because
it
be
a
national
secondary
road
.
I
can
not
emphasise
that
enough
.
it
have
be
devoid
and
starve
of
investment
for
decade
now
.
all
we
be
ask
be
that
the
government
not
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
in
term
of
the
next
phase
of
the
project
.
we
be
fearful
that
if
there
be
any
reprofiling
of
road
spending
-
in
other
word
,
cutback
-
to
rob
Peter
to
pay
Paul
,
we
will
get
catch
in
the
cross
hair
in
north
Cork
,
between
Mallow
and
Mitchelstown
.
I
be
plead
with
the
government
not
to
take
this
off
the
agenda
and
to
allow
it
to
go
to
the
next
stage
.
in
the
context
of
overall
national
spend
on
road
,
€
10
million
be
but
a
drop
in
the
ocean
.
it
be
a
significant
amount
but
it
would
have
a
untold
benefit
for
people
travel
from
Kerry
to
Dublin
,
for
people
who
travel
from
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
and
vice
versa
and
,
in
particular
,
for
local
traffic
.
that
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
road
be
a
major
arterial
route
for
local
traffic
,
local
commerce
,
family
bring
child
to
school
and
people
who
travel
for
medical
reason
,
include
acute
medical
reason
,
for
care
in
Dublin
.
they
would
travel
from
Rathmore
on
through
Mallow
and
on
up
to
Dublin
.
there
be
a
part
of
the
road
I
have
just
mention
,
from
Clogher
Cross
to
Canteen
Cross
,
or
Waterdyke
,
that
have
to
be
do
.
I
be
implore
the
government
not
to
take
it
off
the
agenda
.
I
have
be
in
touch
with
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
and
Transport
,
Deputy
Michael
McGrath
and
Eamon
Ryan
,
and
I
have
have
engagement
with
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Transport
,
deputy
Hildegarde
Naughton
,
about
this
.
I
be
ask
that
it
stay
on
the
agenda
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
ask
she
to
use
she
good
office
and
positive
influence
to
bend
the
ear
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
and
Michael
McGrath
,
and
perhaps
the
Taoiseach
,
whom
I
have
also
contact
about
this
issue
.
it
make
eminent
sense
to
progress
this
project
to
tender
now
.
if
TII
have
allocate
€
1.5
million
for
one
stretch
of
the
road
,
namely
,
Clogher
Cross
to
Canteen
Cross
,
and
€
300000
for
Annakisha
South
,
all
that
need
to
be
do
now
be
to
press
the
green
light
for
the
project
to
go
to
tender
and
get
the
job
do
.
the
road
will
then
be
right
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
,
except
normal
upkeep
and
maintenance
.
my
fear
,
however
,
be
that
the
project
will
slip
back
down
the
agenda
in
term
of
national
prioritisation
if
there
be
any
reprofiling
of
budget
for
road
in
the
estimate
process
.
I
be
raise
this
issue
at
a
critical
time
in
the
hope
that
every
minister
will
look
at
the
case
for
the
project
and
see
it
stack
up
to
make
the
investment
at
this
stage
rather
than
waste
the
money
that
have
be
spend
thus
far
by
not
progress
it
.
if
it
be
not
progress
now
,
it
will
not
be
progress
next
year
or
in
the
year
after
that
.
it
will
go
into
a
queue
,
we
will
be
wait
until
kingdom
come
for
the
work
to
be
do
and
the
investment
of
€
1.5
million
and
€
300000
will
be
for
nautht
.
we
should
spend
the
money
wisely
to
upgrade
the
road
now
,
for
the
reason
I
have
outline
.
the
RISM
metric
be
a
load
of
codswallop
.
I
appreciate
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
respond
on
behalf
of
another
minister
but
the
reality
be
that
this
be
a
unsafe
road
.
just
because
a
accident
or
collision
have
not
happen
do
not
mean
it
will
not
happen
.
the
problem
be
the
number
of
heavy
goods
vehicle
that
use
the
road
and
have
to
traverse
the
white
line
at
point
where
there
be
no
verge
.
there
be
no
margin
of
error
for
driver
,
which
be
why
they
have
to
slow
down
to
a
stop
.
I
thank
the
deputy
again
for
raise
this
issue
.
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
and
I
know
the
road
around
Galway
very
well
.
I
expect
there
be
many
people
who
use
the
N73
who
have
far
more
sway
than
I
in
advance
the
project
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
,
who
have
responsibility
for
this
matter
,
have
set
out
that
under
the
hd
15
network

analysis
programme
,
safety
work
be
base
on
accident
density
across
the
network
.
that
section
of
the
network
with
considerably
high
than
average
accident
density
be
select
for
analyse
and
section
of
the
road
that
be
amenable

solution
be

treatment
.
I
will
take
the
point
the
deputy
have
raise
this
evening
to
the
minister
.
it
be
clear
this
project
have
be
identify
in
previous
costing

I
know
that
when
one
see
something
go

the

normally

I
welcome
this
motion
because
it
provide
a
timely
opportunity
to
discuss
the
issue
of
fuel
poverty
and
the
loom
energy
crisis
.
the
first
call
we
have
to
make
,
as
member
of
the
Oireachtas
and
representative
of
the
people
,
will
be
to
again
discuss
the
recently
announce
lift
of
the
moratorium
on
energy
disconnection
.
we
need
such
a
measure
to
ensure
that
people
be
not
cut
off
from
they
utility
supply
,
include
electricity
,
should
they
find
themselves
unable
to
pay
they
bill
over
the
come
winter
period
and
beyond
.
I
call
on
the
government
to
engage
with
the
commission
for
Regulation
of
utility
on
that
issue
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
the
regulator
at
least
discuss
the
possibility
of
put
that
moratorium
in
place
again
.
a
number
of
year
ago
,
I
visit
a
house
in
north
Cork
.
I
will
not
say
where
it
be
but
as
I
pull
up
to
the
gate
there
be
a
woman
lift
a
bag
of
timber
block
in
through
she
front
door
.
it
be
a
mid-terrace
house
and
she
be
lift
the
bag
in
through
she
front
door
.
naturally
,
we
would
all
assist
in
that
circumstance
and
I
do
so
.
she
and
I
get
to
talk
and
we
be
discuss
the
state
of
she
house
and
the
fact
that
she
be
pile
wood
into
a
fire
to
feed
a
back
boiler
to
heat
the
house
.
she
have
no
other
means
of
heat
the
house
and
she
spend
she
time
cling
to
she
fire
.
the
woman
be
in
the
same
situation
a
number
of
year
late
.
we
have
not
see
a
tangible
great
leap
forward
in
retrofit
programme
for
people
who
have
own
they
house
for
a
long
time
but
do
not
have
the
means
to
reinvest
in
they
because
there
be
a
shortfall
between
the
grant
available
and
the
true
cost
of
retrofit
.
if
that
cost
could
be
bridg
,
whether
for
people
live
in
a
local
authority
house
or
owner
-
occupier
,
it
would
greatly
assist
the
likes
of
that
woman
.
a
low
-
cost
loan
,
such
as
that
propose
by
the
government
,
will
not
be
sufficient
for
she
to
bridge
the
gap
.
her
savings
would
be
meagre
because
she
be
wholly
dependent
on
the
Department
of
social
Protection
for
she
means
of
income
.
there
have
to
be
a
good
way
of
ensure
that
the
thousand
of
people
in
similar
circumstance
be
give
a
opportunity
to
retrofit
they
house
in
a
way
that
provide
proper
heating
and
insulation
and
damp
-
proof
they
home
to
prevent
the
mould
on
wall
that
all
of
we
have
observe
in
house
we
have
visit
over
the
year
.
this
have
to
be
a
meaningful
objective
of
the
government
.
the
available
evidence
would
suggest
that
in
the
past
seven
or
eight
year
in
particular
,
we
have
not
have
that
great
leap
forward
or
deal
with
the
coterie
of
people
I
be
talk
about
,
of
whom
the
woman
I
describe
be
a
representative
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
acknowledge
that
.
if
something
be
do
for
that
woman
,
we
would
not
find
ourselves
argue
in
this
house
about
pre-budget
submission
that
seek
increase
payment
and
transfer
to
people
on
the
basis
that
they
have
to
meet
the
cost
of
continue
to
shove
wood
on
the
fire
to
feed
the
back
boiler
.
all
of
that
would
be
take
out
of
the
equation
.
be
that
as
it
may
,
we
be
at
a
juncture
where
measure
will
have
to
be
introduce
in
this
budget
to
offset
the
cost
of
the
increase
price
of
carbon
.
fuel
poverty
measure
must
be
in
evidence
in
the
budget
to
allow
that
woman
to
at
least
offset
the
cost
of
the
coal
,
briquette
and
block
that
she
be
force
to
burn
to
meet
she
need
.
that
issue
have
to
be
address
with
a
short
-
term
measure
.
budget
2022
must
introduce
a
carbon
tax
credit
as
a
offset
measure
to
deal
with
household
that
will
find
themselves
in
the
fuel
impoverish
category
in
the
come
12
month
and
beyond
.
if
the
increase
in
the
price
of
the
carbon
tax
be
already
price
in
follow
last
year
's
budget
,
the
danger
be
that
people
on
low
income
will
find
themselves
have
to
hunt
around
to
meet
the
cost
of
heat
they
home
.
if
a
refundable
tax
credit
be
introduce
for
this
people
,
it
would
be
a
meaningful
measure
that
would
at
least
offset
the
cost
of
the
increase
price
of
carbon
and
give
some
level
of
comfort
to
that
household
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
factor
that
suggestion
into
he
consideration
,
if
the
budget
have
not
already
be
put
to
bed
,
and
the
interplay
between
line
Department
and
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
at
this
late
hour
,
some
measure
that

and

impoverished
household
a
refundable
carbon
tax
credit
that
would
offset
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
energy
and
fuel
would
be
welcome
.
as
a
short
-
term
measure
,
the
Labour
Party
also
advocate
extend
the
fuel
allowance
by
four
week
.
this
measure
have
also
be
advocate
by
representative
organisation
,
particularly
that
represent
people
who
find
themselves
wholly
reliant
on
the
Department
of
social
Protection
for
a
payment
.
if
the
fuel
allowance
be
extend
by
four
week
or
increase
by
€
5
per
week
,
that
would
be
worth
approximately
€

to
recipient

that
would

the
woman
I
be
talk
about
.
President
Higgins
use
to
say
of
rural
electrification
that
it
take
the
stoop
out
of
the
back
of
the
woman
in
Ireland
because
they
be
not
bend
down
stoke
a
fire
all
they
life
to
keep
the
house
light
and
put
food
on
the
table
.
it
seem
that
thing
might
not
have
change
for
a
good
number
of
we
citizen
,
particularly
that
who
be
live
in
the
fuel
impoverished
house
we
be
talk
about
.
I
be
not
have
a
go
at
the
Minister
of
State

the

this
should
be
a
non-partisan
and
apolitical
issue

we
should
all

recommendation
on
this
issue
and
they

,
which
be
representative
of
the
people
,
have
fall
on
deaf
ear
in

the

could
bring
into
play
some
simple
measure
,
include
the
carbon

credit
,
that
would

a

I
thank
a
Cathaoirleach
Gníomhach
and
I
will
carry
out
a
rapid
-
fire
round
of
all
the
issue
I
can
speak
to
within
five
minute
.
it
be
a
awful
way
of
do
business
but
I
nonetheless
understand
it
.
my
first
issue
be
disability
,
to
continue
on
deputy
Tully
's
theme
and
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
be
present
.
I
welcome
the
allocation
of
€
13
million
of
additional
new
funding
for
residential
service
.
I
be
encounter
within
my
constituency
a
severe
shortage
of
residential
place
,
so
much
so
that
in
a
recent
parliamentary
question
date
11
October
,
I
receive
a
response
in
respect
of
a
person
who
be
look
for
a
full
-
time
residential
place
for
a
family
member
and
be
tell
:
"
unfortunately
,
the
number
of
people
require
residential
service
far
exceed
the
number
of
vacancy
within
the
service
.
"
I
welcome
the
additional
€
13
million
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
be
of
a
mind
to
do
so
,
I
would
ask
she
to
look
at
the
regional
residential
forum
to
see
how
that
be
operate
and
whether
there
need
to
be
more
work
do
or
a
great
light
shine
on
how
it
operate
,
which
would
be
welcome
.
with
regard
to
agriculture
,
€
49
million
be
to
be
the
ring
-
fence
for
agriculture
and
the
decarbonisation
effort
.
if
we
be
talk
about
a
just
transition
in
agriculture
and
if
we
be
to
include
farmer
in
that
just
transition
towards
decarbonisation
,
send
a
message
to
they
-
I
be
talk
about
small
farmer
,
not
big
rancher
-
that
the
government
be
take
€
40
million
away
from
they
and
give
it
to
the
Department
of
social
Protection
be
not
the
right
message
at
this
time
.
there
be
justifiable
anger
within
the
farming
community
.
they
understanding
be
that
this
be
to
be
ring
-
fence
within
the
carbon
tax
and
be
to
help
with
decarbonisation
measure
.
this
be
a
promise
that
be
make
within
the
programme
for
government
,
which
have
be
renege
upon
,
and
that
be
something
we
will
have
to
interrogate
further
as
time
go
on
.
if
the
government
be
to
bring
the
farming
community
with
it
on
this
decarbonisation
agenda
,
and
to
move
away
from
facile
statement
such
as
''
reduce
the
national
herd
''
,
this
issue
be
worthy
of
great
debate
as
it
be
a
great
deal
more
complex
than
that
.
the
move
to
take
€
49
million
from
the
farming
sector
to
assist
it
to
transition
and
decarbonise
be
ill
-
advise
and
be
something
that
should
be
revise
in
2022
,
if
possible
.
I
acknowledge
the
contribution
of
the
minister
,
deputy
O’Gorman
,
on
the
youth
travel
card
.
the
typical
fare
for
a
student
travel
from
Mallow
to
Cork
be
€
7
return
.
there
be
no
Leap
facility
on
this
route
.
I
will
be
talk
about
Mallow
to
Cork
and
Leap
service
until
the
cow
come
home
or
until
someone
eject
I
from
this
House
but
the
fare
will
be
half
price
at
€
3.50
through
the
youth
card
.
that
be
excellent
and
will
cost
€
1.75
single
.
that
be
a
competitive
fare
and
be
brilliant
for
somebody
in
the
undereducated
-
23
year
category
.
if
this
be
not
expand
or
if
Leap
service
be
not
put
in
place
on
route
which
be
typical
of
the
rest
of
the
country
outside
Dublin
,
we
have
a
problem
.
I
can
travel
from
Pearse
Station
Dublin
to
Greystone
on
a
Leap
card
but
I
cannot
travel
from
Mallow
to
Cork
on
this
card
.
the
youth
card
be
fine
and
it
send
a
wonderful
signal
to
young
people
that
the
price
be
come
down
,
which
I
welcome
,
but
for
people
who
want
to
get
out
of
they
car
and
get
on
to
commuter
train
,
it
do
nothing
.
I
be
make
the
case
again
in
the
short
time
that
I
have
for
the
expansion
of
the
Leap
service
to
provincial
rural
town
outside
of
the
Dublin
conurbation
and
to
start
think
beyond
the
Pale
.
if
the
government
can
get
people
out
of
they
car
and
on
to
train
and
public
transport
and
if
Leap
service
be
enable
,
more
people
will
use
they
.
there
be
a
latent
demand
there
for
this
.
I
welcome
the
youth
card
,
as
everybody
do
,
because
it
will
reduce
price
for
young
people
.
that
be
excellent
and
well
do
on
that
.
it
be
a
great
first
step
and
the
government
should
think
about
the
expansion
of
that
service
.
the
way
to
do
that
for
that
who
be
not
student
or
who
be
in
the
over
23
year
category
be
more
Leap
card
service
throughout
country
,
no
matter
where
people
live
.
this
be
about
equalisation
and
non-discrimination
on
the
basis
of
not
live
in
Dublin
.
this
be
not
,
incidentally
,
a
anti-dublin
rant
but
this
be
just
the
reality
for
most
people
on
the
ground
.
the
expenditure
report
on
road
safety
measure
mention
specific
road
.
the
N73
be
not
.
the
much
-
vaunted
m25
be
not

.
be
that
even
in
the
national

plan
?
the

also

I
welcome
much
of
yesterday
's
budget
and
commend
my
colleague
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
and
he
government
colleague
on
its
introduction
.
however
,
I
want
to
begin
by
make
a
general
point
about
the
entire
budgetary
process
.
it
be
date
,
irrelevant
to
people
's
daily
life
and
it
be
do
we
a
disservice
in
this
House
that
one
day
's
business
should
get
all
the
attention
and
drama
,
as
in
the
open
night
of
a
film
or
theatre
production
.
the
follow
-
on
and
impact
the
budget
have
on
people
's
daily
life
be
leave
for
non-elected
people
to
manage
and
proceed
,
and
there
be
little
accountability
.
that
be
why
we
have
hundred
of
thousand
of
people
on
waiting
list
,
such
as
the
young
boy
whose
situation
be
discuss
on
Claire
Byrne
's
radio
programme
yesterday
.
it
be
why
we
have
so
many
people
on
housing
waiting
list
and
people
who
will
not
see
the
benefit
of
the
€
80
billion
-
plus
spending
programme
that
be
announce
yesterday
.
this
be
the
15th
budget
I
have
address
as
a
member
of
the
House
.
it
have
always
strike
I
that
the
health
service
plan
be
a
really
good
example
of
the
lack
of
accountability
in
the
budgetary
process
.
the
plan
will
dictate
and
operationalise
the
expenditure
of
some
€
22
billion
,
yet
it
will
probably
be
publish
,
go
on
previous
year
,
in
the
couple
of
day
before
the
Christmas
recess
,
when
nobody
will
give
it
any
attention
.
there
will
not
be
24
-
7
media
coverage
of
its
content
,
live
television
interview
with
minister
or
discussion
for
hour
on
end
of
what
be
contain
in
it
.
however
,
that
document
set
out
how
the
money
the
House
be
approve
will
be
spend
and
the
way
in
which
it
will
make
a
difference
.
when
it
come
to
the
health
service
plan
,
the
oversight
be
aprè
the
fact
.
the
chairman
of
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
,
deputy
Stanley
,
will
get
to
see
it
and
examine
the
expenditure
arise
from
it
next
year
,
as
will
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
even
if
there
be
issue
with
how
the
money
be
spend
,
nobody
be
ever
hold
to
account
.
in
fact
,
the
only
people
who
be
hold
to
account
be
that
on
waiting
list
and
that
whose
life
's
journey
be
make
much
more
complicated
by
a
system
that
do
not
seem
to
work
for
people
and
have
they
need
at
its
heart
.
we
can
do
a
Punch
and
Judy
act
in
this
chamber
throw
argument
over
and
back
,
but
the
reality
be
that
we
have
a
major
problem
with
we
delivery
mechanism
in
this
country
.
the
people
who
be
lose
out
because
of
that
be
the
people
we
serve
.
yes
,
we
have
a
oversight
role
and
we
need
to
be
strong
in
how
we
do
it
,
but
the
more
time
I
spend
here
,
the
more
I
see
that
we
need
to
reform
the
budget
process
entirely
.
it
be
unfair
on
people
whose
daily
income
depend
on
State
support
and
who
must
wait
for
this
day
every
year
to
know
what
they
will
have
to
spend
in
the
come
12
month
.
we
need
to
get
to
multi-annual
budgeting
for
people
who
depend
on
social
welfare
payment
.
we
need
multi-annual
budgeting
in
order
for
Department
to
know
what
they
have
to
spend
.
this
nonsense
of
have
to
spend
allocate
money
quickly
in
the
few
month
before
the
end
of
each
year
,
a
situation
which
allow
all
sort
of
issue
around
accountability
to
arise
,
need
to
stop
.
the
Committee
on
Budgetary
Oversight
,
chair
by
deputy
Hourigan
,
do
wonderful
work
but
we
need
to
look
at
the
entire
budgetary
process
and
ask
ourselves
whether
it
be
the
proper
way
to
do
business
in
the
21st
century
.
there
be
a
number
of
key
issue
arise
from
yesterday
's
budget
.
many
of
the
benefit
it
make
provision
for
be
welcome
,
particularly
in
a
context
where
they
be
the
first
major
tax
cut
and
substantial
12
-
month
and
52
-
week
welfare
increase
for
many
year
.
however
,
the
government
will
have
to
be
hyper
-
vigilant
when
it
come
to
inflation
and
ensure
there
be
no
price
gouging
go
on
within
a
already
difficult
market
across
many
area
.
the
cost
of
fuel
,
food
and
input
for
construction
,
agriculture
and
many
other
sector
be
already
rise
fast
than
people
's
income
.
we
must
make
sure
there
be
no
profiteering
.
I
would
like
to
see
extra
resource
for
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
to
ensure
it
be
visible
and
active
in
monitor
price
,
particularly
in
the
fuel
and
food
sector
,
so
that
people
have
a
assurance
that
this
issue
be
be
watch
and
manage
.

of
the

that

be
write

they
do
not
reflect

let
we
have
a
honest
debate
about
what
be
in
each
budget
document
.
let
we
get
that
document
independently
cost
before
the
budget
be
publish
in

that
we
can
have
a
honest
debate
.
let
we
ensure
each
budget
document
be
lay
out
along
the
same
parameter
,
as
oppose
to
have

that
shift
more

Opposition

depend
on

some

criticise
the

that

despite
the
fact
that
this
be
the

indicate
in
they
own

's

document
.
there
be
much
criticism
of
the
fuel
allowance
provision
,
even
though
the
increase
certain
party
propose
be
way
below
what
have
be

the
fuel
allowance
increase
kick
in
from
yesterday
evening
and
will
be
back
-
pay
in
a
few
week
's
time
.
I
wish
the
exemption
change
be
great
,
because
the
allowance
be
still
not
be
pay
to
all
the
people
who
need
it
,
but
we
have
make
a
start
.
the
living
alone
allowance
be
very
important
for
people
.
there
be
criticism
today
that
the
increase
be
only
€
3
,
but
that
€
3
come
on
top
of
a
additional
€
5
last

,
which
amount
to
a
increase
of
€
8
in
the
past
12
month
.
every
cent
of
that
money
will
be
spend
on
local
service
and
in
local

.
that
type
of
support
be
really
important
to

,
which
be
why
it

it

the
follow

on

have
on

be
leave
for
non-elected
people
to

and
there
be
little

that
be
why
we
have
hundred

such
as
the
young

be
discuss

always
strike
I
that
the
health

plan
be
a
really
good
example
of
the
lack

in

.
the

will
dictate

operationalise
the

22

it
will
probably
be
publish

go
on

,
in

the

whether

there
be
a

of
key

arise
from

many
of
the

the

the

it
be
a
poor
relation
and
it
spend
that
money
much
good
than
many
of
its
large
competitor
.
it
be
money
very
well
spend
and
we
need
to
see
that
continue
.
I
be
not
normally
into
opposition
bashing
but
have
listen
over
the
past
24
hour
to
the
different
response
from
various
speaker
,
I
be
remind
of
a
feis
year
ago
where
people
would
come
in
with
a
script
they
would
recite
each
time
,
but
with
different
intonation
depend
on
what
they
be
teach
to
emphasise
or
stress
,
to
try
to
impress
the
adjudicator
.
it
seem
like
many
of
the
script
that
have
be
deliver
in
the
House
be
write
week
ago
,
possibly
while
deputy
be
on
they
summer
holiday
,
because
they
do
not
reflect
what
be
in
the
budget
.
let
we
have
a
honest
debate
about
what
be
in
each
budget
document
.
let
we
get
that
document
independently
cost
before
the
budget
be
publish
in
order
that
we
can
have
a
honest
debate
.
let
we
ensure
each
budget
document
be
lay
out
along
the
same
parameter
,
as
oppose
to
have
goalpost
that
shift
more
often
than
Opposition
Member
's
position
,
depend
on
what
be
be
say
on
Twitter
at
any
give
time
.
some
speaker
be
here
today
criticise
the
fact
that
pensioner
be
only
get
a
extra
fiver
,
despite
the
fact
that
this
be
the
figure
indicate
in
they
own
party
's
policy
budget
document
.
there
be
much
criticism
of
the
fuel
allowance
provision
,
even
though
the
increase
certain
party
propose
be
way
below
what
have
be
guarantee
by
the
government
.
the
fuel
allowance
increase
kick
in
from
yesterday
evening
and
will
be
back
-
pay
in
a
few
week
's
time
.
I
wish
the
exemption
change
be
great
,
because
the
allowance
be
still
not
be
pay
to
all
the
people
who
need
it
,
but
we
have
make
a
start
.
the
living
alone
allowance
be
very
important
for
people
.
there
be
criticism
today
that
the
increase
be
only
€
3
,
but
that
€
3
come
on
top
of
a
additional
€
5
last
year
,
which
amount
to
a
increase
of
€
8
in
the
past
12
month
.
every
cent
of
that
money
will
be
spend
on
local
service
and
in
local
shop
.
that
type
of
support
be
really
important
to
people
,
which
be
why
it
be
essential
that
the
government
be
hyper
-
vigilant
on
inflation
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
local
improvement
scheme
,
LIS
.
it
be
a
valuable
scheme
and
one
that
have
benefit
many
rural
dweller
.
we
perception
be
that
a
significant
proportion
of
the
2021
allocation
go
to
the
Cavan
and
Monaghan
region
.
Cork
be
the
big
county
and
the
native
county
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Joe
O'Brien
,
and
it
could
argue
by
any
objective
analysis
that
it
do
not
receive
a
proportionate
and
fair
share
of
that
allocation
.
the
metric
will
clearly
show
that
,
in
the
second
round
,
Cavan
and
Monaghan
do
extremely
well
.
I
take
the
point
that
the
minister
be
make
in
respect
of
the
second
tranche
and
the
notification
to
individual
local
authority
,
but
I
would
argue
that
,
by
any
reasonable
analysis
,
the
lead
-
in
time
in
July
and
the
deadline
for
receipt
be
very
short
.
Cork
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
be
the
large
county
with
the
most
road
.
the
Minister
of
State
sit
beside
the
minister
will
attest
to
that
fact
.
come
out
of
the
second
allocation
,
there
be
not
a
proportionate
allocation
across
the
board
.
Cork
could
tee
up
approximately
€
2
million
in
LIS
project
,
which
would
take
a
savage
amount
of
a
allocation
out
of
the
LIS
.
Cork
,
with
the
reasonable
people
that
there
be
in
the
local
authority
,
put
in
project
-----
-----
for
which
there
be
a
return
for
a
minimal
investment
.
all
I
be
ask
for
in
2022
be
equity
across
the
board
for
every
county
.
we
will
have
to
carry
this
conversation
on
outside
.
all
I
be
ask
be
that
account
be
take
of
the
size
of
county
like
Galway
and
Cork
.
they
be
big
county
with
a
large
number
of
road
,
for
which
there
be
the
potential
to
deliver
more
through
the
LIS
.
the
whole
nature
of
the
LIS
be
to
service
road
that
be
unserviced
by
local
authority
.
we
have
a
lot
more
of
that
in
Cork
than
most
other
county
.
I
acknowledge
what
the
minister
be
say
in
respect
of
Limerick
and
she
own
part
of
the
world
,
but
there
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
or
a
long
lead
-
in
time
to
allow
local
authority
to
respond
with
project
.
that
be
all
I
be
ask
for
in
2022
.
I
support
my
colleague
on
this
issue
and
I
will
give
a
minor
perspective
on
it
.
when
this
organisation
be
apply
for
funding
,
the
funding
come
in
from
local
authority
be
sometimes
perceive
to
be
ad
hoc
and
may
not
be
transformative
in
term
of
what
they
want
to
do
,
even
though
they
be
look
for
modest
amount
.
if
there
be
a
core
funding
line
come
from
the
Department
,
I
would
certainly
join
with
my
colleague
in
support
it
.
in
the
round
,
I
be
try
to
glean
from
the
minister
a
perspective
on
the
next
common
agricultural
Policy
,
CAP
,
and
how
Pillar
ii
fall
in
respect
of
leader
funding
and
the
co-funding
.
it
would
be
useful
to
know
what
percentage
be
in
the
mind
of
the
minister
for
co-funding
on
Pillar
ii
element
.
we
be
hear
80
%
or
90
%
.
perhaps
the
minister
could
give
we
some
view
on
that
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
she
response
.
we
acknowledge
the
additional
€
70
million
that
have
be
provide
but
we
be
start
from
a
pretty
low
base
.
the
€200
million
allocate
for
2016
to
2020
be
way
down
on
the
€400
million
that
have
be
allocate
historically
.
we
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
will
be
successful
in
claw
back
that
money
and
increase
the
amount
necessary
to
provide
for
Pillar
ii
.
have
there
be
bilateral
engagement
at
between
both
Department
at
ministerial
level
?
my
second
question
be
more
of
a
point
.
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
be
say
that
this
be
farmer
's
money
.
there
be
some
of
we
who
would
argue
that
while
it
be
farmer
's
money
,
it
be
also
money
that
should
go
to
rural
Ireland
and
there
need
to
be
a
certain
countering
of
that
narrative
.
I
would
like
to
get
the
minister
's
perspective
on
that
as
well
.
in
try
to
get
people
to
live
in
town
centre
,
I
would
like
the
minister
to
consider
the
issue
of
application
before
a
local
authority
for
conversion
of
a
premise
in
town
that
be
Edwardian
or
Georgian
in
they
architectural
character
.
applicant
find
they
meet
massive
impediment
when
deal
with
the
local
authority
planning
department
.
I
ask
that
some
leeway
be
give
to
take
into
account
the
historical
nature
of
that
building
.
it
be
not
always
easy
to
apply
a
21st
century
model
of
architecture
to
a
18th
or
19th
century
building
.
I
ask
the
minister
allow
for
some
leeway
or
headroom
to
be
give
to
the
applicant
such
that
they
can
make
the
conversion
without
it
be
overly
onerous
,
while
also
meet
the
fire
safety
and
other
standard
one
would
expect
for
any
application
.
I
engage
with
the
minister
previously
on
CAP
and
its
effect
on
leader
funding
.
she
acknowledge
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
deputy
McConalogue
,
be
go
around
the
country
do
he
roadshow
at
present
.
I
wonder
if
the
minister
be
of
a
mind
to
do
a
similar
type
of
roadshow
.
certainly
,
we
want
to
ensure
that
what
will
be
secure
inside
the
farm
gate
will
be
the
good
possible
outcome
for
farmer
,
but
also
what
will
be
secure
outside
the
farm
gate
for
rural
dweller
and
people
live
in
rural
Ireland
be
similarly
important
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
I
welcome
she
specific
reference
to
the
Irish
local
Development
Network
.
the
ILDN
have
outline
,
through
its
future
leader
working
group
,
a
document
which
,
to
my
mind
,
represent
a
good
direction
of
travel
.
if
there
be
to
be
great
traction
on
that
document
in
term
of
what
the
ILDN
can
deliver
for
rural
Ireland
,
that
would
be
a
good
way
forward
.
the
condition
the
deputy
have
describe
be
unacceptable
.
when
the
issue
be
raise
in
relation
to
Oliver
bond
House
by
deputy
Bríd
Smith
,
I
have
direct
contact
with
the
resident
association
there
.
it
have
be
very
active
in
Oliver
bond
House
and
I
give
it
great
credit
for
that
.
that
approach
from
a
resident
association
be
good
but
we
have
to
make
inroad
in
resolve
this
issue
.
to
that
end
,
the
Department
have
give
careful
consideration
to
the
finding
of
the
European
committee
ruling
and
be

adaptation
.
I
hope
this
be
of
use
to
the
deputy
.
the
minister
,
deputy
O'Brien
,
be
commit
to
work
with
Dublin
City
Council
to
resolve
the
issue
that
have
be
highlight
.
the
type
of
living
condition
the
deputy
describe
be
unacceptable
and
need
to
be
resolve
.
the
select
Committee
on
foreign
affair
and
Defence
discuss
this
issue
last
week
,
as
we
have
previously
hear
,
and
my
colleague
,
deputy
Stanton
,
raise
significant
issue
at
that
committee
.
my
understanding
be
that
there
be
no
significant
objection
to
the
agreement
but
a
number
of
issue
be
raise
.
for
a
small
country
like
Ireland
that
have
focus
on
grow
we
trade
around
the
world
,
a
agreement
like
this
offer
many
opportunity
.
we
trade
with
the
Association
of
South
East
Asian
Nation
,
Asean
,
region
amount
to
more
than
€
10
billion
in
2019
.
it
be
also
essential
that
the
EU
maintain
a
strong
relationship
with
country
in
the
Pacific
region
as
China
aggressively
expand
its
influence
.
that
be
why
the
EU
recently
publish
its
Indo
-
Pacific
strategy
on
how
it
will
engage
with
the
region
.
however
,
this
statement
on
the
agreement
also
offer
we
a
chance
to
be
very
clear
about
we
value
and
what
we
stand
for
as
a
trading
bloc
.
in
many
way
,
Singapore
be
a
major
competitor
of
Ireland
's
,
as
it
have
also
position
itself
as
a
hub
for
global
trade
and
commerce
.
however
,
we
have
concern
about
human
rights
and
the
protection
available
in
Singapore
.
the
foreign
Interference
(
Countermeasures
)
act
2021
that
be
pass
just
two
week
ago
be
deeply
concerning
because
it
target
so
-
call
"
foreign
influence
"
and
many
think
it
will
be
use
to
stifle
dissent
.
it
give
the
home
affair
minister
the
power
to
investigate
individual
suspect
of
be
foreign
agent
engage
in
"
hostile
information
campaign
"
.
a
independent
panel
chair
by
a
judge
will
consider
appeal
against
the
minister
's
finding
,
although
person
mark
as
"
politically
significant
"
will
not
be
allow
to
file
such
appeal
.
what
do
"
politically
significant
"
mean
?
be
it
someone
campaign
against
the
law
and
rule
of
Singapore
,
for
example
?
authority
will
also
be
allow
to
compel
social
media
platform
and
website
operator
to
hand
over
user
datum
without
any
justification
in
select
instance
.
in
2019
,
it
also
pass
a
law
give
authority
the
power
to
police
online
platform
and
even
private
chat
group
.
this
do
not
sound
in
line
with
EU
value
.
the
foreign
Interference
(
Countermeasures
)
act
,
FICA
,
be
a
deeply
chill
law
that
will
impact
on
freedom
of
expression
,
association
and
privacy
and
we
should
be
very
concerned
about
its
implication
,
especially
for
that
campaign
to
strengthen
human
rights
.
Eleven
organisation
,
include
Amnesty
International
and
human
Right
watch
,
have
call
on
Singapore
to
withdraw
the
law
because
it
contravene
international
legal
and
human
rights
principle
.
the
treatment
of
migrant
labour
in
Singapore
be
also
a
area
of
major
concern
.
the
rights
of
worker
and
the
condition
they
have
to
work
under
in
a
tropical
climate
be
deeply
concerning
.
as
for
the
retention
of
capital
punishment
,
include
the
death
penalty
and
public
flog
,
four
people
be
execute
in
2019
,
include
two
for
drug
-
related
offence
.
there
be
a
mandatory
death
sentence
for
import
or
export
certain
quantity
of
drug
.
another
major
concern
be
about
LGBTI
rights
in
Singapore
.
the
Minister
of
State
might
make
clear
to
the
House
how
we
intend
to
ensure
that
we
defend
and
promote
the
rights
of
member
of
the
LGBTI
community
,
a
area
in
which
Ireland
have
be
a
world
leader
,
and
how
they
will
be
protect
and
enhance
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
also
be
aware
that
in
February
2019
,
the
European
Parliament
adopt
a
resolution
on
this
agreement
call
for
LGBTI
rights
in
Singapore
through
the
free
trade
deal
.
the
European
Parliament
condemn
the
lack
of
such
rights
and
protection
and
call
for
the
abolition
of
law
penalise
same
-
sex
relationship
and
for
full
protection
of
LGBTI
and
woman
's
rights
through
anti-discrimination
legislation
.
it
be
important
also
to
note
that
Singapore
retain
a
colonial
-
era
law
from
the
1930s
.
section
377a
of
the
Penal
code
continue
to
criminalise
sex
between
man
.
the
question
for
Ireland
must
be
how
we
leverage
we
trade
relationship
and
position
within
the
EU
to
influence
and
change
this
.
pass
this
agreement
despite
all
this
human
rights
issue
be
deeply
problematic
.
that
be
why
before
we
in
the
Labour
Party
can
agree
to
support
this
motion
,
therefore
,
we
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
outline
what
Ireland
and
the
EU
will
do
about
this
deeply
concern
matter
.
that
be
deeply
patronising
.
it
be
the
most
condescending
statement
to
make
towards
fellow
member
.
we
speak
with
some
level
of
authority
and
proof
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
clarify
that
.
there
be
a
interesting
article
in
the
Irish
Times
by
Conor
Lally
.
it
state
:
Gardaí
have
identify
over
50
young
people
in
and
around
one
Co.
Kerry
town
who
be
recruit
as
money
mule
for
a
international
crime
syndicate
.
the
Irish
Times
understand
a
young
man
from
Munster
be
believe
to
be
work
for
the
crime
gang
as
a
recruiter
and
he
reach
into
the
local
population
,
especially
among
student
,
have
prove
significant
.
the
recruiter
,
himself
a
Irish
teenager
,
appear
to
have
be
very
successful
at
convince
he
peer
to
allow
they
bank
account
be
use
to
receive
money
from
the
fraud
carry
out
by
the
gang
.
Garda
source
say
they
be
very
concerned
such
a
large
number
of
young
people
in
a
relatively
sparsely
populate
part
of
the
Republic
be
so
willing
to
allow
they
account
to
be
use
.
I
raise
this
article
in
the
context
of
this
debate
because
one
of
the
element
of
this
be
the
creation
of
a
bank
account
register
,
as
I
understand
it
,
and
that
register
will
provide
information
through
a
single
access
point
,
include
name
,
iban
,
date
of
account
opening
and
closing
,
duration
of
the
lease
period
in
the
case
of
safety
deposit
box
and
so
on
.
the
Kerry
case
be
relevant
to
this
.
I
do
not
want
to
sound
like
Pollyanna
but
the
fear
I
have
concern
young
people
,
in
particular
.
we
have
all
make
mistake
when
we
be
young
.
we
be
foolish
and
do
stupid
thing
.
person
who
make
mistake
will
be
subject
to
the
rigour
of
the
law
.
of
that
there
can
be
no
question
or
doubt
.
however
,
I
be
fearful
that
mistake
people
make
when
they
be
young
could
follow
they
throughout
life
.
how
will
this
new
database
impact
on
that
young
people
,
for
instance
?
will
they
account
and
name
be
permanently
list
on
the
database
?
there
be
always
a
imbalance
between
the
crime
lord
and
the
mule
.
the
mule
be
always
the
first
to
be
subject
to
the
rigour
of
the
law
and
the
crime
lord
walk
off
into
the
sunset
or
Marbella
or
wherever
they
happen
to
be
.
I
be
concerned
that
there
will
be
a
disproportionately
negative
impact
on
people
who
find
themselves
in
the
position
where
they
account
have
be
use
.
if
a
crime
have
be
commit
,
they
be
subject
to
the
rigour
of
the
law
but
,
once
that
be
do
,
if
it
be
do
in
this
case
,
I
hope
this
do
not
follow
they
for
the
rest
of
they
life
.
it
be
a
issue
that
arise
in
the
last
24
hour
.
I
be
hopeful
there
will
be
some
clarity
around
how
that
case
in
Kerry
would
be
impact
.
it
concern
teenager
who
may
or
may
not
have
do
something
stupidly
or
in
ignorance
.
some
will
know
quite
well
what
they
be
up
to
and
know
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
but
there
be
always
people
who
will
be
lead
on
and
naive
.
I
be
fearful
they
could
be
forever
blacklist
in
any
financial
transaction
they
have
.
if
they
go
on
to
lead
good
,
decent
and
proper
life
and
hold
account
,
I
hope
this
do
not
follow
they
and
they
be
not
blacklist
by
financial
institution
or
statutory
agency
.
I
hope
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
will
provide
some
clarity
on
the
simple
question
I
have
ask
.
I
welcome
the
short
debate
on
this
important
matter
,
which
have
afford
the
House
the
opportunity
to
mark
the
month
in
which
pregnancy
and
Infant
loss
Remembrance
Day
occur
.
we
know
that
300
to
350
family
be
affect
by
stillbirth
annually
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
be
also
conscious
of
that
parent
who
register
stillbirth
on
the
understanding
that
the
record
will
not
be
open
to
public
access
.
some
formulation
should
be
find
to
accommodate
they
need
and
wish
.
as
I
say
,
the
minister
of
the
day
set
two
aim
for
the
relevant
legislation
when
it
be
introduce
in
1994
.
the
first
be
to
recognise
the
therapeutic
effect
that
registration
might
deliver
for
grieve
parent
.
the
second
be
to
create
a
permanent
record
akin
to
the
register
of
birth
within
the
civil
registration
system
.
the
challenge
be
to
ensure
this
two
aim
be
be
address
in
the
current
manner
in
which
registration
be
complete
and
record
access
.
as
the
legislation
stand
,
access
be
very
restrictive
and
somewhat
out
of
line
with
the
access
allow
for
other
form
of
registration
where
sensitivity
be
also
engage
.
the
minister
be
commit
to
engage
with
parent
and
interested
party
to
see
whether
a
good
formulation
can
be
find
to
address
they
concern
while
also
alig
the
operation
of
the
stillbirth
register
with
other
register
maintain
by
the
GRO
.
I
will
take
the
point
the
deputy
make
about
access
to
maternity
leave

the

.

that
be
agree
,
a
Leas

Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
speak
to
this
issue
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
Bill
.
we
be
,
however
,
up
to
we
oxter
in
legislation
on
this
issue
,
and
I
be
not
necessarily
convinced
that
more
legislation
be
the
way
forward
,
but
we
support
the
principle
of
the
Bill
.
there
be
no
question
about
that
.
we
have
to
interrogate
the
number
more
forcefully
.
I
do
not
doubt
-
I
have
never
doubt
-
the
bona
fide
of
the
Minister
of
State
and
what
she
be
seek
to
achieve
.
the
issue
be
one
of
resource
and
the
lack
thereof
.
I
have
sympathy
with
any
line
minister
who
have
to
go
up
against
a
minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
in
a
budgetary
process
to
fight
for
resource
,
particularly
resource
for
child
.
we
in
this
house
seem
to
have
fail
miserably
,
collectively
and
historically
,
when
it
come
to
child
and
they
need
because
there
be
this
antiquated
process
whereby
the
line
minister
of
the
day
,
through
a
budgetary
process
,
have
to
fight
on
he
or
she
back
for
service
that
should
self
-
evidently
be
make
available
.
we
all
come
in
here
and
speak
about
the
need
of
child
and
where
society
should
deliver
for
child
,
but
the
evidence
show
that
that
be
not
happen
in
reality
.
I
be
constantly
tab
parliamentary
question
about
the
assessment
of
need
process
and
the
child
's
disability
network
team
process
.
on
21
September
2021
I
receive
a
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
-
Parliamentary
question
no.
1213
of
9
September
2021
-
in
which
I
have
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
-
for
health
,
I
stress
-
the
number
of
child
see
across
all
area
of
intervention
in
each
community
healthcare
organisation
,
CHO
,
area
since
the
commencement
of
the
progress
disability
service
policy
on
19
April
2021
and
the
number
await
a
assessment
in
each
of
that
cho
since
the
advent
of
the
policy
and
the
child
's
disability
network
team
policy
.
in
CHO
4
there
be
997
child
still
await
a
assessment
.
that
be
incontrovertible
proof
that
the
system
have
not
bedd
down
and
there
be
more
work
to
be
do
.
this
be
the
figure
produce
by
the
HSE
.
the
total
number
of
overdue
application
be
997
.
the
number
of
overdue
application
with
exceptional
circumstance
be
238
.
the
number
of
overdue
application
without
exceptional
circumstance
be
759
.
we
do
not
even
know
if
this
be
real
-
time
figure
because
the
HSE
have
say
that
the
information
that
can
be
provide
be
for
the
end
of
quarter
2
of
2021
and
that
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
activity
in
that
period
may
have
be
impact
by
the
recent
cyberattack
on
the
HSE
.
as
I
understand
it
,
application
be
deem
overdue
if
it
have
be
over
six
month
since
the
application
be
accept
by
the
HSE
and
there
be
no
record
of
a
assessment
report
be
send
to
the
liaison
officer
or
the
applicant
.
I
say
respectfully
to
the
Minister
of
State
that
we
still
have
a
problem
in
CHO
4
,
that
be
,
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
.
we
still
have
a
problem
in
Kildare
,
Dublin
and
west
Wicklow
.
there
be
936
child
await
initial
assessment
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
use
she
good
office
and
to
use
the
weight
of
she
office
to
lean
on
the
HSE
to
extract
from
it
commitment
that
that
number
will
come
down
rapidly
and
that
that
child
's
rights
will
be
meet
under
the
Disability
Act
2005
,
which
be
subsequently
the
subject
of
high
court
proceedings
.
I
want
to
raise
that
specifically
because
it
be
pertinent
to
this
debate
.
as
for
Cork
and
Kerry
community
healthcare
organisation
,
there
be
,
as
I
understand
it
,
14
team
,
11
in
Cork
and
three
in
Kerry
.
however
,
again
through
a
parliamentary
question
I
tab
,
I
find
that
4611
child
be
transfer
to
the
various
team
around
Cork
in
April
but
that
only
1694
of
they
have
have
they
initial
contact
with
they
team
since
then
.
we
all
want
to
give
the
policy
of
the
child
's
disability
network
team
,
cDNT
-
we
be
so
full
of
acronym
now
-
a
fair
wind
,
but
the
measure
of
success
will
be
in
the
number
and
the
metric
.
if
we
see
relatively
low
number
,
we
will
know
it
be
work
and
at
least
parent
and
child
will
have
have
that
contact
with
that
cDNT
.
however
,
I
have
evidence
in
a
email
here
that
I
receive
from
one
family
just
last
week
.
it
state
:
I
be
sorry
for
the
wait
in
assess
service
,
but
it
be
take
we
long
than
expect
to
meet
the
child
on
we
caseload
due
to
much
-
long
-
than
-
expect
transfer
number
.
we
will
,
however
,
be
run
parent
workshop
and
group
very
soon
,
which
will
assess
parent
in
help
they
child
's
communication
and
prepare
child
for
preschool
amongst
many
other
area
.
I
be
in
the
process
of
finalise
this
workshop
with
my
team
and
you
will
receive
a
list
of
all
upcoming
intervention
very
soon
.
I
do
not
doubt
the
aim
of
the
community
development
network
team
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
they
be
try
to
do
they
good
.
however
,
for
parent
to
receive
a
email
like
that
on
behalf
of
a
child
send
a
signal
to
they
that
here
they
go
again
,
that
they
have
just
come
off
one
list
,
that
they
be
go
onto
another
one
and
that
they
have
not
really
progress
.
in
this
instance
the
child
have
be
wait
for
about
two
year
for
service
.
that
be
deeply
upsetting
for
that
family
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
use
she
good
office
to
put
pressure
on
the
team
through
the
cho
that
we
need
to
see
that
number
decrease
and
see
the
service
roll
out
,
that
would
give
a
lot
of
confidence
in
the
system
.
again
,
we
in
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
legislation
-
there
be
no
question
about
that
-
but
what
we
want
to
see
be
the
evidence
of
the
system
work
for
child
.
before
I
sit
down
,
I
will
refer
to
one
of
my
local
organisation
,
the
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
.
there
be
a
great
grá
for
all
this
section
38
and
section
39
organisation
.
the
relationship
between
member
of
the
Oireachtas
and
this
organisation
be
excellent
and
we
all
try
to
do
we
very
good
to
ensure
that
service
be
roll
out
within
we
service
area
and
across
we
constituency
,
and
beyond
we
constituency
as
well
.
however
,
there
be
a
issue
in
Cooleens
respite
service
,
in
St.
Joseph's
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
intervene
with
St.
Joseph
's
with
a
view
to
have
that
facility
reopen
,
it
would
give
a
lot
of
relief
to
family
in
that
area
.
I
again
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
in
fairness
to
she
,
she
always
have
a
open
door
and
be
solution
-
drive
,
and
we
have
to
give
she
credit
for
that
,
but
there
be
more
work
to
be
do
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
amendment
no.
1
,
in
the
name
of
the
Minister
for
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
,
to
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
regard
renter
.
on
Tuesday
,
19
October
2021
,
on
the
question
,
"
that
the
amendment
to
the
motion
be
agree
to
"
,
a
division
be
claim
and
in
accordance
with
Standing
Order
80
(
2
)
,
that
division
must
be
take
now
.
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
,
further
down
the
speak
slot
,
it
allow
time
to
read
a
minister
of
State
's
speech
and
parse
the
word
.
in
support
this
Bill
,
in
the
same
spirit
as
we
have
always
do
,
we
would
continue
to
support
any
initiative
that
come
before
the
House
in
respect
of
highlight
the
continue
important
presence
of
credit
union
in
we
town
and
village
throughout
the
country
.
in
propose
a
amendment
to
the
Bill
,
the
Minister
of
State
state
that
it
be
deem
to
be
read
a
second
time
this
day
nine
month
to
allow
for
the
progression
of
the
review
of
policy
framework
,
which
be
at
a
advanced
stage
and
for
such
progression
to
be
take
into
account
in
further
scrutiny
of
this
Bill
.
at
face
value
,
it
would
appear
that
he
be
seek
to
engage
with
the
proposer
of
the
Bill
and
,
pend
the
review
,
see
where
stand
the
Bill
.
however
,
when
I
quote
from
he
speech
,
I
be
a
little
bit
disturb
by
some
of
the
word
,
which
suggest
that
the
contrary
be
the
case
.
he
start
by
state
,
"
the
potential
legislative
amendment
will
be
consider
as
part
of
the
review
"
.
the
key
point
be
he
statement
be
:
however
,
my
engagement
have
highlight
that
there
be
no
firm
consensus
as
to
the
desire
legislative
change
which
would
assist
in
solve
the
financial
challenge
to
the
sector
.
I
do
not
want
to
raise
unrealistic
expectation
about
the
potential
impact
of
any
such
change
,
if
it
be
approve
.
I
have
be
long
enough
around
the
House
,
include
have
serve
as
a
minister
of
State
,
to
recognise
the
code
language
in
that
.
that
suggest
that
the
government
have
no
intention
whatsoever
of
promulgate
this
Bill
.
it
may
be
that
the
only
exercise
if
the
Bill
be
to
succeed
be
that
the
review
have
to
be
fast
-
track
in
a
way
that
involve
engagement
with
all
of
the
stakeholder
.
even
if
the
pregnant
pause
,
to
use
deputy
Connolly
's
expression
,
that
have
now
replace
the
guillotine
be
to
be
implement
as
a
tool
,
it
be
a
coarse
tool
to
use
not
to
allow
legislation
to
proceed
to
committee
stage
.
however
,
if
the
one
thing
that
come
out
of
this
be
a
fast
-
tracking
of
the
review
such
that
the
stakeholder
feel
that
they
have
be
meaningfully
engage
with
,
then
that
might
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
.
it
be
hard
not
to
be
cynical
,
however
,
because
the
Minister
of
State
say
,
"
I
hope
to
update
the
House
in
the
not
too
distant
future
of
the
government
's
plan
to
support
the
credit
union
sector
"
.
there
be
too
many
if
and
but
.
the
language
be
nebulous
.
we
want
concrete
action
in
respect
of
a
sector
that
be
vital
to
the
functioning
of
this
society
.
there
be
3.6
million
credit
union
member
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
there
be
€
16.38
billion
in
savings
and
€
19.28
billion
in
asset
.
I
could
go
on
.
credit
union
have
be
consistently
vote
the
good
organisation
for
customer
experience
for
the
past
seven
year
.
credit
union
stakeholder
be
in
and
out
of
this
House
,
through
the
committee
structure
,
on
a
regular
basis
.
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
hear
from
all
of
we
be
a
genuine
plea
to
government
to
engage
with
stakeholder
in
the
credit
union
sector
so
that
credit
union
can
lend
productively
within
they
community
.
it
be
most
patronising
for
he
to
come
into
the
House
and
say
:
I
would
encourage
they
to
engage
more
with
local
community
group
,
voluntary
and
sport
organisation
to
increase
they
lending
.
its
in
keep
with
they
etho
and
social
value
to
the
community
.
I
be
speechless
at
that
remark
.
the
volunteer
in
credit
union
know
exactly
what
they
etho
,
mandate
and
mission
be
.
they
be
do
this
day
in
and
day
out
.
they
be
seek
to
lend
.
however
,
now
the
very
etho
that
underpin
the
credit
union
movement
be
be
hamper
by
regulatory
overreach
where
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
the
Central
Bank
now
control
whether
the
credit
union
can
pay
a
dividend
.
this
stick
in
the
craw
of
every
reasonable
and
rational
credit
union
member
who
ever
be
,
include
I
.
dividend
restriction
on
credit
union
by
the
Central
Bank
have
,
by
stealth
,
undermine
the
ethical
basis
through
which
credit
union
be
create
.
there
be
a
time
when
Fianna
Fáil
would
have
stand
up
to
the
Central
Bank
on
issue
like
this
.
there
be
a
time
when
Fianna
Fáil
would
have
push
back
against
the
Central
Bank
on
this
.
the
way
to
push
back
against
the
Central
Bank
on
this
now
be
to
put
in
place
a
proper
policy
framework
so
that
credit
union
can
realise
they
full
potential
throughout
Ireland
and
within
the
very
community
that
we
represent
.
I
do
not
know
what
the
modus
operandi
of
the
Central
Bank
be
,
but
be
high
time
that
we
reach
a
point
where
it
and
the
Department
of
Finance
pull
back
a
little
and
consider
the
potential
of
the
sector
.
give
the
stark
reduction
in
the
number
of
credit
union
throughout
the
State
,
there
be
the
danger
of
a
existential
threat
to
they
very
existence
in
some
of
the
community
mention
here
today
where
bank
have
go
to
ground
.
there
be
no
oversight
of
the
Central
Bank
by
other
central
bank
in
respect
of
the
regulation
of
credit
union
.
I
reiterate
the
point
about
dividend
restriction
.
there
be
no
other
country
in
western
Europe
where
there
have
be
transformational
change
in
governance
in
credit
union
.
that
involve
be
volunteer
who
have
go
through
a
process
and
have
do
everything
that
have
be
ask
of
they
in
term
of
governance
and
meeting
requirement
.
it
be
time
to
give
they
a
fair
chance
,
take
the
foot
off
they
neck
and
let
they
thrive
.
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
,
EPA
,
have
publish
a
report
on
urban
wastewater
treatment
.
Raw
sewage
be
be
discharge
from
34
town
and
village
.
we
be
tell
construction
will
start
on
14
location
this
year
and
eight
in
2022
.
a
third
of
this
town
and
village
will
continue
to
release
raw
sewage
after
2024
.
the
report
identify
a
number
of
location
specifically
in
Cork
.
Cobh
,
thankfully
,
be
to
be
resolve
this
year
,
but
Ballycotton
,
Whitegate
,
Aghada
and
Mitchelstown
be
plan
for
late
in
the
decade
,
as
be
Inchigeelagh
.
the
EPA
's
concern
be
that
repeat
plan
over
the
year
have
not
be
act
upon
.
this
be
not
just
a
ecological
and
environmental
issue
.
the
lack
of
this
facility
be
also
impact
on
the
housing
crisis
.
for
many
young
people
with
mortgage
approval
in
town
like
Mitchelstown
where
there
be
capacity
constraint
who
wish
to
see
house
build
and
where
builder
with
site
be
ready
to
go
,
the
EPA
report
make
for
very
grim
reading
.
I
ask
the
Taoiseach
to
give
this
he
priority
.
deputy
-----
there
will
be
a
opportunity
to
come
in
during
the
question
and
answer
session
.
you
be
encroach
the
time
allocate
to
deputy
Connolly
.
I
will
let
in
the
deputy
again
during
the
question
and
answer
session
.
that
conclude
the
speak
slot
and
20
minute
be
now
allocate
for
a
question
and
answer
session
.
there
be
a
protocol
whereby
we
will
move
through
various
group
in
the
Opposition
.
question
have
be
raise
and
I
propose
to
move
now
to
the
Sinn
Féin
allocation
of
time
in
this
session
.
we
can
then
move
through
the
various
Member
.
I
propose
to
allocate
five
minute
for
the
Minister
of
State
to
conclude
after
the
20
-
minute
slot
,
but
that
be
probably
not
enough
time
for
he
to
wrap
up
and
answer
all
the
question
.
I
therefore
propose
to
stick
with
the
order
of
speaker
and
move
to
the
question
and
answer
session
.
I
be
hopeful
there
will
be
enough
time
at
the
end
.
perhaps
ten
minute
within
the
20
-
minute
slot
will
be
sufficient
for
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
the
other
question
.
before
the
Minister
of
State
address
the
question
,
I
wish
to
clarify
that
I
propose
to
go
to

I
again
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
very
important
issue
of
the
provision
of
the
ambulance
base
locate
in
Carlow
town
.
I
do
not
have
the
information
on
what
area
be
high
on
the
list
but
I
will
try
to
get
that
information
from
the
minister
and
I
will
ask
he
to
forward
it
to
the
deputy
.
in
line
with
Sláintecare
and
Vision
2020
,
a
significant
programme
of
work
be
under
way
to
transform
the
National
Ambulance
Service
from
a
emergency
medical
service
into
a
mobile
medical
service
.
this
be
a
model
that
aim
to
treat
patient
at
the
low
appropriate
level
of
acuity
,
result
in
a
good
experience
for
the
patient
and
a
more
efficient
use
of
resource
.
as
the
deputy
rightly
say
,
Carlow
ambulance
base
be
a
integral
part
of
the
ambulance
service
.
she
praise
the
advanced
paramedic
,
the
ambulance
service
and
all
the
staff
and
I
join
with
she
in
that
.
they
have
do
great
work
,
not
just
in
Carlow
and
the
south
east
but
across
the
country
.
they
have
certainly
save
life
and
we
be
very
proud
of
they
.
the
capital
spend
on
ambulance
base
facility
be
a
integral
part
of
the
ambulance
service
and
be
prioritise
by
the
National
Ambulance
Service
to
meet
the
requirement
of
that
basis
with
the
high
need
.
this
year
,
a
unprecedented
€
187.5
million
be
be
invest
in
the
National
Ambulance
Service
.
this
include
€
10
million
in
additional
funding
to
progress
priority
area
in
line
with
the
National
Ambulance
Service
strategic
reform
,
include
continue
to
target
capacity
deficit
as
identify
in
the
National

Service
emergency
service
baseline
and
capacity
review
.
again
,
engagement
be
continue
between
the
National
Ambulance
Service
and
HSE
estate
in
progress
the
capital
submission
for
a
replacement
base
.
the
Labour
Party
will
also
support
the
Bill
,
while
reserve
the
right
to
bring
forward
amendment
on
Committee
stage
.
on
the
issue
of
scrambler
,
specifically
,
it
be
most
welcome
to
see
some
overdue
action
on
they
use
,
and
that
of
quad
bike
and
other
vehicle
,
when
they
be
associate
with
antisocial
behaviour
.
we
know
there
have
a
number
of
private
member
'
bill
on
this
matter
over
the
year
and
action
to
tackle
it
cannot
come
soon
enough
.
in
particular
,
we
pay
tribute
to
the
former
Lord
Mayor
of
Dublin
,
Andrew
Montague
,
who
have
be
critical
of
the
scourge
of
this
vehicle
for
many
year
now
.
despite
the
Road
traffic
act
and
other
relevant
legislation
available
in
this
area
,
Garda
authority
have
indicate
that
the
use
of
quad
bike
and
scrambler
by
minor
and
youth
in
public
park
have
prove
difficult
to
deal
with
from
a
enforcement
perspective
.
member
of
a
Garda
Síochána
be
instruct
not
to
pursue
youth
on
quad
bike
,
scrambler
and
so
on
,
owe
to
the
inherent
safety
risk
in
pursue
this
vehicle
.
if
such
pursuit
be
to
take
place
,
there
would
be
a
high
risk
of
they
end
in
collision
at
speed
,
result
in
serious
injury
or
death
.
as
a
result
,
bring
this
vehicle
to
a
stop
be
challenging
.
we
welcome
any
attempt
to
stamp
out
that
scourge
via
legislation
.
that
be
to
be
welcome
in
the
Bill
.
we
hope
the
Minister
of
State
will
offer
some
clarity
,
however
,
in
respect
of
the
practicality
of
stop
young
offender
on
dangerous
vehicle
.
the
problem
surround
the
misuse
of
quad
bike
and
scrambler
have
become
more
and
more
prevalent
in
the
past
five
year
and
in
the
past
few
year
there
have
be
some
particularly
tragic
end
for
individual
use
this
vehicle
.
a
number
of
accident
,
some
fatal
,
have
be
cause
by
individual
on
scrambler
motorcycle
collide
with
or
drive
into
park
car
.
by
restrict
where
such
vehicle
can
lawfully
drive
,
we
would
hold
they
accountable
to
safe
driving
practice
,
not
just
for
the
safety
of
the
public
but
also
they
own
,
as
we
need
to
protect
they
as
well
.
the
sad
fact
be
that
many
owner
of
such
vehicle
who
engage
in
antisocial
behaviour
be
young
and
inexperienced
driver
who
seek
the
thrill
of
drive
recklessly
and
think
it
be
above
the
odd
that
they
will
be
involve
in
a
accident
.
we
welcome
the
provision
within
the
legislation
.
however
,
we
will
be
seek
further
clarity
on
how
they
will
be
police
thereafter
.
there
be
another
provision
within
the
Bill
on
which
I
seek
clarity
.
it
relate
to
the
power
of
a
Bord
Pleanála
.
as
I
understand
it
,
new
power
will
be
vested
in
a
Bord
Pleanála
to
permit
new
road
,
which
could
theoretically
supersede
any
local
development
plan
or
county
development
plan
.
I
seek
clarity
on
this
because
my
thinking
on
it
may
not
be
absolutely
correct
.
as
I
understand
it
,
a
new
power
be
to
be
vested
in
a
Bord
Pleanála
to
approve
scheme
or
propose
road
development
that
could
materially
contravene
any
county
development
plan
.
section
45
of
the
Bill
state
:
the
Act
of
1993
be
amend
by
the
insertion
of
the
follow
section
after

within

meaning
of

)
only
if
it
consider
that
one
of
the
follow
be
the
case
:
(

)
the

of

,
regional

(

;
(

the

regard
to
the
transport
strategy

under
section

and
Heritage
or any
minister
of

government
.
there
be
other
area
but
I
do
not
need
to
quote
they
.
where
do
local
area
plan
and
county
development
plan
stand
in
light
of
this
new
provision
?
be
it
the
case
that
a
Bord
Pleanála
will
supersede
by
its
action
any
plan
that
have
be
make
by
the
member
via
the
reserve
function
they
have
on
local
authority
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
my
initial
reaction
be
that
that
would
be
a
worry
trend
.
it
could
be
argue
that
there
be
regulatory
overreach
inherent
in
that
provision
.
however
,
I
remain
open
-
minded
and
I
await
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
to
that
fear
.
I
be
sure
she
will
allay
my
fear
.
I
have
no
doubt
about
that
.
however
,
I
feel
it
be
important
to
raise
this
as
a
issue
,
particularly
as
local
authority
member
guard
preciously
they
right
to
make
they
plan
in
the
good
interest
of
the
people
they
represent
in
the
area
they
represent
.
I
seek
further
clarity
on
that
issue
.
there
be
another
issue
that
be
not
pertinent
to
this
Bill
,
but
give
that
the
Bill
speak
to
road
safety
and
ensure
that
there
be
a
regime
and
a
system
in
this
country
whereby
road
user
have
the
benefit
of
robust
legislation
to
ensure
they
can
go
about
they
business
in
the
good
way
possible
,
I
will
raise
it
.
as
we
know
,
driver
testing
be
now
control
by
the
Road
Safety
Authority
,
RSA
.
I
have
be
inform
that
32
tester
be
about
to
have
they
contract
terminate
between
December
of
this
year
and
April
of
next
year
,
across
three
cohort
.
I
worry
greatly
about
that
because
during
the
lockdown
,
each
and
every
one
of
we
be
inundate
with
request
from
we
constituent
about
driver
testing
,
whether
that
be
the
theory
test
,
the
practical
test
or
people
not
get
timely
date
for
testing
and
be
send
all
over
the
country
in
order
to
pursue
they
test
as
candidate
.
that
be
particularly
true
in
respect
of
the
theory
test
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
driver
tester
employ
through
the
RSA
be
to
be
let
go
,
and
I
understand
there
be
32
in
this
cohort
who
be
on
temporary
contract
at
present
,
then
I
worry
greatly
about
the
throughput
of
applicant
who
might
get
catch
in
the
cross
hair
of
that
job
loss
if
they
be
to
occur
.
I
seek
some
latitude
from
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
on
this
as
I
know
it
be
not
germane
to
the
Bill
.
I
fully
appreciate
that
but
it
do
speak
to
the
issue
of
road
safety
.
if
32
driver
tester
be
to
be
let
go
by
the
RSA
,
that
would
do
any
confidence
there
be
within
the
system
.
some
clarity
on
that
would
be
very
welcome
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
the
role
of
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
in
planning
application
.
it
go
back
to
the
point
I
make
specifically
about
the
new
role
to
be
define
for
a
Bord
Pleanála
.
we
all
know
that
on
national
secondary
route
in
particular
,
when
planning
application
come
in
from
genuine
applicant
who
be
seek
to
build
house
,
sometimes
on
family
-
own
land
and
very
often
on
a
site
they
would
have
acquire
or
be
acquire
subject
to
planning
permission
,
when
they
make
the
application
to
the
local
authority
,
correspondence
be
put
on
the
file
by
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
as
regard
its
perceive
opposition
to
any
planning
application
make
to
a
local
authority
where
they
be
contiguous
to
,
adjacent
to
or
in
close
proximity
to
a
national
secondary
route
.
at
face
value
,
that
would
appear
,
theoretically
,
to
be
laudable
as
it
would
ensure
there
be
not
more
vehicle
come
out
onto
a
national
primary
or
secondary
route
.
however
,
it
seem
to
have
become
practice
regardless
of
take
into
account
the
particular
mitigating
circumstance
of
individual
planning
application
.
where
there
be
genuine
application
make
for
housing
on
the
basis
of
a
genuine
need
and
fulfil
all
the
condition
as
lay
down
in
rural
planning
guideline
,
there
seem
to
be
a
root
-
and
-
branch
rule
by
TII
to
write
submission
on
planning
application
.
it
do
not
quite
oppose
they
but
it
express
reservation
.
this
seem
to
be
a
uniform
approach
and
it
be
have
a
detrimental
impact
on
the
ability
of
people
to
build
house
in
rural
area
.
be
this
something
that
could
be
look
at
in
the
context
of
either
planning
or
road
safety
?
we
all
accept
TII
's
bona
fide
.
however
,
from
time
to
time
there
be
mitigating
circumstance
and
it
be
perceive
to
be
overly
strident
in
its
attitude
towards
individual
planning
application
where
there
be
mitigating
circumstance
.
that
be
a
issue
that
affect
thousand
of
people
right
across
the
State
who
seek
to
make
a
planning
application
.
it
would
be
remiss
of
I
,
as
I
have
do
so
previously
privately
,
not
to
mention
the
N73
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
Road
.
it
be
a
national
secondary
route
and
arguably
one
of
the
bad
such
route
in
the
country
.
if
I
have
the
mandate
and
the
power
to
amend
the
Bill
-----
-----such
that
I
could
get
the
N73
route
stitch
into
that
Bill
and
secure
the
allocation
of
€
8
million
to
€
10
million
to
complete
that
3
kilometer
stretch
of
road
,
I
would
do
that
.
unfortunately
,
I
be
a
opposition
politician
-----
-----
and
I
be
seek
to
do
my
good
for
my
constituent
in
Cork
East
.
if
there
be
anything
the
Minister
of
State
can
do
,
through
she
good
office
,
to
influence
TII
to
get
that
3
kilometer
stretch
of
the
N73
complete
,
that
would
be
great
.
it
be
a
national
secondary
route
that
serve
that
travel
between
Kerry
and
Dublin
.
it
be
a
vital
arterial
route
for
trade
,
commerce
and
resident
's
daily
journey
.
Cork
County
Council
have
prepare
the
tender
document
for
it
.
if
there
be
a
way
in
which
we
could
get
it
to
the
next
stage
where
that
money
could
be
allocate
,
it
would
be
a
great
day
's
work
for
everybody
involve
.
it
would
be
remiss
of
I
not
to
speak
on
a
road
traffic
Bill
without
be
parochial
.
I
be
unashamedly
parochial
in
this
instance
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
for
she
forbearance
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
.
we
welcome
the
attempt
by
the
government
and
by
the
Minister
of
State
to
address
a
wide
array
of
issue
.
we
acknowledge
that
the
transport
committee
do
much
good
work
on
the
pre-legislative
scrutiny
of
the
Bill
.
on
that
basis
,
we
will
be
support
the
Bill
on
second
stage
.
I
spare
the
House
six
minute
.
I
welcome
this
debate
and
the
enthusiasm
of
the
minister
,
who
clearly
know
he
brief
.
it
be
opportune
that
we
be
discuss
Science
Week
.
I
be
a
former
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
.
I
be
particularly
proud
of
the
fact
that
I
be
there
at
the
inception
of
APC
,
Insight
,
IPIC
,
Lero
and
MaREI
in
particular
,
give
the
importance
of
potential
offshore
wind
energy
.
I
also
pay
tribute
to
the
people
who
you
do
not
see
in
public
.
they
be
the
people
behind
the
scene
of
Science
Week
,
in
the
Discover
science
programme
,
in
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
the
people
who
help
to
create
the
tool
for
the
week
,
and
the
people
who
develop
the
continuous
professional
development
programme
.
they
be
the
unseen
people
who
be
the
real
heroe
of
science
week
.
they
disseminate
the
science
or
assist
in
its
dissemination
,
either
as
teacher
or
in
the
various
show
and
event
that
take
place
.
they
be
the
real
heroe
because
they
facilitate
the
capturing
of
imagination
and
inculcate
in
young
mind
the
idea
that
scientific
endeavour
be
worthy
of
pursuit
.
we
owe
they
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
the
hide
work
that
be
too
often
underappreciated
.
I
express
my
appreciation
of
they
work
.
I
welcome
that
there
be
to
be
decoupling
of
the
role
of
chief
scientific
adviser
from
that
of
director
general
of
SFI
.
it
be
long
overdue
and
be
never
intend
to
last
ten
year
when
the
minister
and
I
be
part
of
the
government
of
the
day
.
it
be
a
function
of
a
rationalisation
and
cost
programme
.
I
have
often
wonder
how
many
time
the
chief
scientific
adviser
advise
the
government
on
issue
of
scientific
exploration
or
public
concern
in
the
intervene
period
.
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
that
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
its
board
as
a
funder
have
always
seek
to
be
as
rigorous
as
possible
when
it
come
to
funding
decision
.
however
,
one
must
never
allow
the
perception
to
develop
that
there
could
be
a
conflict
of
interest
between
the
two
.
I
will
speak
on
initial
teacher
education
because
if
we
do
not
have
science
teacher
,
we
do
not
have
Science
week
.
there
be
a
serious
issue
in
respect
of
the
professional
master
of
education
,
pme
,
and
the
pressure
trainee
or
candidate
teacher
be
under
in
the
master
's
programme
.
they
be
work
quite
well
but
it
will
take
time
for
the
throughput
to
be
such
that
we
have
a
ready
supply
.
the
minister
be
aware
of
that
.
a
interesting
study
conduct
by
Dr.
Mark
Prendergast
,
Dr.
Melanie
Ní
Dhuinn
and
Professor
Andrew
Loxley
of
University
College
Cork
and
Trinity
College
Dublin

:
"
'
I
worry
about
money
every
day
'
:
the
financial
stress
of

-

education

"
.
if
the
minister
and
he
official
take
a
moment
to
read
that
report
,
they
will
see
how
stressful
it
be
to
be
a
candidate
on
the
pme
as
we
speak
.
the
research
,
which
be
conduct
on
a
cohort
of
391

respondent
's
view
on
how
they

,
...
financial
and
emotional
,
of

the
teaching
profession
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
.
"
when
the
author
look
at
Finland
,
Ontario
and
Singapore
,
the
lesson
arise
from
that
comparative
study
be
that
,
as
a
policy
intervention
,
this
country
overlook
the
idea
of
pay
prospective
teacher
in
initial
teacher
education
some
fund
to
allow
they
to
allay
the
financial
and
other
difficulty
in
which
they
find
themselves
.
that
can
be
do
either
through
the
cost
of
the
course
,
which
be
relatively
high
,
or
through
facilitate
by
means
of
subsidisation
the
ability
of
initial
teacher
education
candidate
,
particularly
in
stem
field
,
to
be
utterly
focus
on
the
task
at
hand
,
thus
guarantee
a
supply
and
throughput
of
teacher
and
allay
the
current
issue
around
teacher
shortage
.
the
study
find
that
:
...
perhaps
one
lesson
which
have
be
overlook
be
that
all
three
country
[
Finland
,
Ontario
,
Singapore
]
subsidise
the
preparation
of
teacher
.
for
example
,
become
a
teacher
in
Singapore
and
Finland
be
completely
pay
for
,
and
candidate
earn
money
whilst
train
.
in
Ontario
,
there
be
a
quota
of
4500
free
place
.
I
be
not
try
to
be
unrealistic
but
if
we
be
serious
about
the
shortage
of
teacher
,
particularly
in
area
such
as
STEM
,
this
study
clearly
show
there
be
major
pressure
on
teacher
and
trainee
teacher
.
a
example
I
encounter
today
concern
a
trainee
teacher
do
a
placement
in
a
post
-
primary
school
who
be
ask
to
do
a
substitution
role
.
that
be
arguably
unethical
.
it
may
be
understandable
from
the
principal
's
point
of
view
but
the
candidate
will
not
be
pay
for
it
.
that
have
a
impact
on
the
trainee
teacher
's
ability
to
study
.
if
we
talk
about
Science
Week
and
STEM
graduate
,
we
need
to
go
back
to
how
the
teacher
education
system
work
to
have
a
qualitative
look
at
that
candidate
's
experience
and
whether
more
can
be
do
from
a
policy
point
of
view
.

to
clarify
,
question
from
Deputy
O'Connor
,
Griffin
,
Carey
and
Richmond
have
be
group
with
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
's
question
.
I
will
now
revert
to
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
.
we
will
then
take
the
other
speaker
in
sequence
.
one
minute
.
I
advise
the
Deputy
to
keep
they
eye
on
the
clock
.
I
thank
deputy
Cahill
for
share
time
.
I
congratulate
he
,
as
the
chairman
,
and
all
the
member
of
the
Joint
committee
on
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
for
bring
forward
this
report
.
in
the
short
time
available
to
I
,
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
social
economic
Environmental
Forestry
Association
,
SEEFA
,
which
as
a
organisation
have
do
much
to
raise
consciousness
concern
afforestation
and
felling
issue
.
as
we
speak
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
COP26
meeting
,
we
be
fell
more
tree
and
grant
more
licence
to
fall
tree
than
we
be
grant
licence
to
plant
tree
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
.
we
have
the
forestry
licensing
dashboard
before
we
to
show
we
proof
of
that
.
the
total
number
of
afforested
hectare
be
3598
,
but
for
fell
it
be
24185
.
we
be
cut
down
more
tree
than
we
be
planting
.
that
be
a
real
-
time
analysis
of
where
we
stand
regard
forestry
policy
in
this
country
.
the
situation
must
be
reverse
.
in
she
speech
,
the
Minister
of
State
will
tell
we
that
more
ecologist
have
be
appoint
.
that
be
all
well
and
good
,
and
I
do
not
doubt
the
bona
fide
of
the
Minister
of
State
.
however
,
I
have
a
call
from
a
woman
in
my
area
of
Cork
today
who
be
tear
she
hair
out
because
she
have
be
ask
for
another
Natura
impact
statement
,
NIS
,
even
though
she
have
propose
a
forestry
plan
to
she
consultant
.
something
be
still
wrong
in
the
department
regard
how
felling
licence
be
be
deal
with
.
notwithstanding
the
appointment
of
more
ecologist
,
a
massive
gap
remain
and
the
metric
show
that
clearly
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
delve
deep
into
the
licensing
process
in
a
way
that
will
ensure
it
will
be
possible
to
get
rid
of
the
low
hanging
fruit
,
no
pun
intend
,
to
enable
all
the
small
application
be
deal
with
for
fell
licence
,
then
she
would
be
do
a
good
day
's
work
.
on
the
afforestation
side
,
we
take
we
lead
from
people
such
as
Jo
O'Hara
and
deputy
Cahill
,
as
the
chair
of
the
relevant
committee
,
and
the
Mackinnon
report
concern
what
need
to
be
do
to
ensure
proper
afforestation
and
the
proper
management
and
felling
of
we
forest
.
that
must
be
do
to
ensure
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
late
cop
meeting
,
that
we
can
sequester
carbon
and
put
in
place
,
as
deputy
Cahill
say
,
through
the
next
round
of
the
CAP
programme
,
a
system
that
embed
the
idea
that
forestry
will
become
a
integral
part
of
that
programme
.
farmer
will
not
mind
if
such
a
system
be
part
of
Pillar
1
or
Pillar
2
of
CAP
.
forestry
,
however
,
must
be
embed
into
eco-scheme
and
agri-environment
climate
measure
.
it
should
be
self
-
evident
to
everybody
in
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
that
forestry
must
get
the
prominence
it
deserve
.
it
be
a
vital
sector
,
and
we
must
ensure
that
not
only
do
we
have
a
sustainable
forestry
sector
but
that
we
also
recognise
the
potential
that
afforestation
bring
in
help
we
to
meet
we
carbon
emission
target
.
I
would
also
support
any
measure
put
in
place
to
address
the
issue
of
ash
dieback
.
that
farmer
,
forester
and
landowner
be
do
everything
they
can
.
again
,
they
be
also
tear
they
hair
out
because
of
the
inaction
of
the
Department
on
this
matter
.
we
again
have
a
situation
where
the
fact
speak
for
themselves
.
we
be
import
timber
for
we
sawmill
.
on
one
hand
,
we
have
ash
dieback
,
but
,
on
the
other
,
we
do
not
know
what
kind
of
policing
there
be
of
pest
such
as
the
spruce
beetle
.
the
control
in
place
do
not
allow
we
to
know
what
be
come
into
the
country
and
,
therefore
,
we
do
not
know
what
be
come
down
the
line
in
the
context
of
what
be
be
import
.
we
need
the
afforestation
programme
to
at
least
hit
a
target
commensurate
with
the
programme
for
government
target
at
a
minimum
.
when
I
seek
,
in
my
modest
way
,
to
have
sectoral
target
for
forestry
include
in
the
climate
action
and
low
carbon
development
(
amendment
)
act
2021
,
let
we
call
a
spade
a
spade
and
say
that
the
Green
Party
Minister
refuse
to
accept
that
amendment
.
we
have
a
massive
opportunity
in
this
area
and
I
welcome
this
report
.
this
be
a
timely
debate
,
and
I
thank
deputy
Cahill
for
share
he
time
.
we
wish
the
Minister
of
State
well
in

objective
.
I
welcome
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
.
we
be
support
it
.
I
want
to
speak
on
two
specific
scenario
as
they
relate
to
my
county
of
Cork
.
they
certainly
reflect
the
experience
of
the
Sinn
Féin
Deputy
as
they
relate
story
from
they
constituency
.
a
email
I
receive
from
a
person
state
that
on
the
previous
Saturday
a
elderly
man
aged
85
crash
into
two
park
car
on
the
side
of
the
Ballyhooly
road
come
out
of
Glanworth
.
I
be
be
deliberately
parochial
because
it
need
to
be
highlight
.
the
email
state
:
the
man
call
the
ambulance
immediately
.
the
man
be
inform
the
ambulance
would
be
20
minute
.
I
offer
1st
aid
at
the
scene
.
the
man
appear
ok
but
have
pain
in
chest
and
down
he
left
arm
.
the
fire
brigade
attend
the
scene
quickly
...
the
man
be
keep
in
the
car
wait
for
the
ambulance
.
the
fire
brigade
crew
keep
he
as
comfortable
as
possible
with
blanket
and
a
tarpaulin
.
the
emergency
service
tell
the
man
that
he
ambulance
have
be
divert
to
a
heart
attack
and
he
ambulance
be
cancel
.
a
advanced
paramedic
do
arrive
about
1.5
hour
after
the
accident
have
happen
.
around
the
same
time
a
local
doctor
...
see
the
light
and
come
to
help
.
the
gardai
be
on
the
scene
throughout
.
eventually
2.5
hour
after
the
accident
,
as
the
night
be
cold
and
wet
,
the
man
have
to
be
take
from
the
car
and
bring
to
a
neighbour
's
house
for
he
health
and
safety
.
at
this
point
there
be
5
fire
engine
,
3
garda
vehicle
and
a
advanced
paramedic
on
the
scene
.
they
be
able
to
clear
the
rd
and
open
it
again
.
it
be
3
hour
20
minute
before
a
ambulance
eventually
come
and
it
be
4
hour
after
the
accident
before
the
man
leave
in
the
ambulance
for
hospital
.
this
be
quite
a
typical
case
.
I
mention
the
location
because
I
want
to
put
on
record
that
it
be
a
rural
area
in
Cork
but
no
more
than
a
20
-
minute
drive
from
Cork
city
and
the
near
tertiary
hospital
and
no
more
than
half
a
hour
from
the
near
secondary
care
facility
.
this
be
happen
and
it
need
to
be
acknowledge
.
I
grant
that
the
minister
have
acknowledge
the
problem
.
I
absolutely
accept
that
he
have
say
more
financial
resource
be
be
deploy
to
deal
with
the
issue
and
that
he
be
in
the
process
of
recruiting
200
additional
paramedic
who
be
go
through
the
system
.
there
be
a
legitimate
expectation
on
the
part
of
every
citizen
to
expect
that
emergency
service
operate
on
the
basis
of
the
pre-hospital
emergency
care
guideline
and
that
there
be
a
time
limit
by
which
each
call
will
be
triage
.
it
be
very
clear
to
I
that
if
there
have
be
a
change
in
the
protocol
when
people
ring
the
emergency
phone
line
call
for
a
ambulance
,
that
change
have
not
be
communicate
to
we
citizen
.
if
there
have
be
a
shift
in
what
people
's
legitimate
expectation
be
in
respect
of
a
ambulance
come
to
a
scene
and
if
there
have
be
some
change
in
this
protocol
then
they
certainly
have
not
be
communicate
to
the
public
.
this
need
to
be
address
.
notwithstanding
all
of
this
,
the
simple
thing
that
occur
in
the
incident
I
detailed
be
that
there
should
not
have
be
any
ambiguity
in
any
protocol
for
pre-hospital
guideline
involve
a
85
-
year
-
old
man
in
a
road
traffic
accident
.
there
should
not
be
any
ambiguity
about
the
need
to
ensure
that
a
ambulance
arrive
on
time
and
within
the
pre-hospital
guideline
.
this
be
why
I
be
articulate
the
case
.
I
also
receive
the
follow
email
from
a
paramedic
:
I
be
a
paramedic
in
the
National
Ambulance
Service
and
I
have
recently
learn
of
a
Bantry
/
Fermoy
ambulance
crew
who
crash
return
to
base
...
apparently
a
result
of
exhaustion
.
the
crew
in
question
have
clock
up
600
kilometer
+
in
one
shift
.
thankfully
neither
the
crew
or
another
road
user
be
seriously
injure
...
the
crew
escape
with
little
or
no
injury
however
the
next
time
the
crew
,
the
potential
patient
they
carry
and
other
road
user
may
not
be
so
lucky
.
this
be
a
result
of
NEOC
(
national
emergency
operational
control
)
and
national
ambulance
service
management
refuse
to
treat
paramedic
/
emt
with
the
dignity
they
be
entitle
to
and
deserve
this
run
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
.
it
really
do
need
to
be
sort
.
we
welcome
the
motion
.
I
be
delighted
to
see
it
this
evening
.
in
this
country
at
present
,
not
only
be
people
not
guarantee
access
to
a
gp
or
access
to
a
out
-
of
-
hour
gp
service
,
they
cannot
even
be
sure
whether
they
will
get
a
ambulance
if
they
need
it
.
something
be
go
seriously
wrong
.
the
place
be
go
to
hell
in
a
handcart
fairly
lively
.
I
know
we
be
in
the
middle
of
a
pandemic
.
we
all
understand
this
.
the
testimony
the
minister
have
hear
this
evening
be
crucial
.
we
need
to
see
the
ship
be
turn
around
quickly
to
ensure
people
have
confidence
that
the
system
will
deliver
for
they
and
that
at
a
very
minimum
a
85
-
year
-
old
man
could
have
the
legitimate
expectation
for
all
of
he
year
that
if
he
be
involved
in
a
road
traffic
accident
,
the
case
would
be
prioritise
.
the
issue
raise
by
deputy
Cullinane
on
the
length
of
time
that
ambulance
spend
in
emergency
department
need
to
be
tackle
.
it
be
not
good
enough
for
the
minister
to
say
HSE
have
commission
a
review
into
the
issue
with
a
view
to
identify
which
remedial
measure
might
assist
in
the
efficient
release
of
ambulance
resource
from
emergency
department
.
we
have
know
for
age
that
this
have
be
go
on
.
I
could
not
put
a
timeline
on
it
.
the
dog
on
the
street
know
that
ambulance
have
be
back
up
at
emergency
department
since
Adam
be
a
boy
.
the
day
for
come
into
the
House
-----
----
with
that
kind
of
language
be
gone
.
we
need
a
response
.
I
apologise
to
my
colleague
,
deputy
Nash
,
for
go
on
.

the

set
-
up
in

of
SUSI
application
in
case
where
parent
have
go
through
or
be
go
through
marital
separation
be
that
they
must
provide
proof
of

that
be
set
out
in
A15
of
the
application
process
,
which
provide
for
the
necessity
to
provide
evidence
of
separation
.
it
state
:
please
provide
one
of
the
follow
as
proof
of
separation
or
divorce
:
separation
agreement
;
divorce
decree
;
court
order
maintenance
arrangement
;
decree
of
dissolution
for

.
evidence
from
the
Department
of
social
employment
affair
&
Protection
confirm
receipt
of
desert
wife
's
Allowance
or
a
one
-
parent

payment
;
if
there
be
no
legal
agreement
,
a
letter
from
you
solicitor
,
in
which
you
solicitor
confirm
separation
and
/
or
that
legal
proceedings
be
pend
...
there
be
other
criterion
that
a
person
have
to
meet
as
well
.
we
have
a
very
good
relationship
with
SUSI
,
which
I
deal
with
on
a
daily
basis
.
I
can
confirm
the
professionalism
of
the
people
we
deal
with
in
SUSI
.
however
,
what
I
see
be
clear
evidence
that
there
be
a
problem
.
where
there
be
a
family
separation
and
applicant
clearly
meet
the
threshold
of
the
proof
set
out
in
A15
,
have
furnish
the
document
,
in
a
statistically
significant
number
of
case
where
the
application
for
the
grant
be
refuse
,
the
subsequent
SUSI
appeal
fail
because
SUSI
uphold
the
decision
to
refuse
on
the
basis
that
the
A15
provision
be
not
be
meet
.
when
we
subsequently
guide
the
applicant
through
the
student
grant
appeal
board
,
in
most
case
the
decision
to
refuse
be
overturn
by
the
board
.
there
be
a
issue
regard
how
the
assessor
assess
the
separation
element
of
a
SUSI
application
.
it
be
we
view
that
they
be
not
adequately
take
into
account
the
proof
that
applicant
provide
.
I
ask
that
the
Department
engage
with
SUSI
to
conduct
a
look
-
back
of
a
parcel
of
case
where
there
have
be
a
refusal
by
SUSI
and
a
subsequent
awarding
of
a
grant
by
the
student
grant
appeal
board
.
there
have
be
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
number
of
separation
during
the
pandemic
.
I
be
find
that
it
be
often
the
case
with
application
for
SUSI
grant
that
,
where
applicant
provide
proof
of
separation
,
they
be
be
put
through
the
wringer
and
a
unnecessary
burden
and
stress
be
be
place
upon
they
.
the
proof
of
this
be
that
,
when
such
application
be
refuse
,
a
statistically
significant
number
of
refusal
be
overturn
by
the
student
grant
appeal
board
.
we
would
like
the
Department
to
examine
this
matter
in
concert
with
SUSI
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
consider
and
sympathetic
response
.
it
be
clear
that
he
be
on
top
of
this
issue
.
rather
than
my
furnish
he
with
specific
case
,
though
,
I
will
make
a
request
.
give
that
there
be
enough
in
he
acknowledgement
that
"
it
be
a
matter
for
SUSI
to
determine
what
evidence
it
will
accept
as
proof
of
separation
"
,
will
he
signal
to
he
official
to
liaise
with
SUSI
on
do
a
simple
look
-
back
and
require
SUSI
to
furnish
the
number
of
case
?
while
I
know
that
there
be
a
statistically
significant
number
among
the
overall
number
of
case
that
I
deal
with
in
my
constituency
office
,
the
chance
be
that
this
be
happen
throughout
every
constituency
.
therefore
,
I
respectfully
ask
that
the
Minister
of
State
,
through
he
good
office
,
take
it
upon
himself
to
ask
he
official
to
engage
with
SUSI
and
seek
a
look
-
back
or
review
-
it
would
be
a
simple
administrative
exercise
-
so
that
the
subjectivity
of
the
assessor
's
decision
be
take
out
of
the
equation
and
there
be
standardisation
,
thereby
take
stress
for
the
applicant
out
of
the
process
.
I
acknowledge
he
sympathetic
and
consider
response
.
arise
from
it
,
I
be
hopeful
that
some
look
-
back
will
be
take
of
at
least
a
parcel
of
case
where
there
have
be
a
refusal
by
SUSI
and
a
subsequent
awarding
by
the
appeal
board
.
yes
.
thank
you
,
a
Chathaoirligh
.
I
understand
that
the
Order
of
the
House
be
set
out
by
member
by
agreement
.
I
also
understand
that
you
have
a
difficult
job
to
do
,
a
Chathaoirligh
,
in
try
to
chair
this
proceedings
.
I
further
understand
that
everybody
who
want
to
speak
be
allocate
time
.
if
we
be
to
act
in
consort
and
to
obey
the
rule
,
then
people
might
afford
I
the
time
that
have
be
allocate
to
I
and
my
party
.
I
will
take
the
ten
minute
.
I
welcome
the
debate
on
this
Bill
.
I
welcome
that
people
be
exercise
about
it
.
I
welcome
the
fact
there
be
a
majority
consensus
around
the
Bill
.
that
be
what
this
House
be
about
-
hear
voice
that
be
against
and
for
a
proposition
.
however
,
each
and
every
one
of
we
be
entitle
to
promulgate
legislation
and
we
be
entitle
to
be
hear
.
I
understand
the
argy
-
bargy
that
happen
,
but
it
sometimes
get
a
bit
much
.
sometimes
,
it
be
a
bit
ridiculous
.
to
deputy
Duncan
Smith
's
credit
,
he
set
out
a
explanatory
memorandum
when
he
be
draft
this
Bill
.
it
read
,
"
there
be
increase
awareness
of
the
need
to
make
inform
consumer
choice
base
on
the
environmental
impact
of
goods
-
they
'
carbon
footprint
'
.
"
we
can
argue
about
the
language
of
what
constitute
a
carbon
footprint
and
who
design
that
language
in
the
first
instance
,
but
the
concept
of
a
carbon
footprint
be
broadly
accept
.
the
memorandum
continue
,
"
some
company
have
introduce
they
own
labelling
system
show
,
for
example
,
the
quantity
of
greenhouse
gas
emit
in
the
process
of
manufacturing
and
shipping
product
to
consumer
.
"
we
can
all
accept
the
fact
there
be
such
thing
as
global
warming
and
greenhouse
gas
emission
.
if
we
accept
that
fundamental
principle
,
then
we
be
off
to
a
good
start
.
some
may
not
accept
they
,
and
that
be
they
entitlement
.
the
memorandum
continue
:
a
full
carbon
inventory
will
attempt
to
itemise
all
greenhouse
gas
emission
release
throughout
the
product
life
-
cycle
,
from
the
extraction
of
raw
material
through
to
the
product
's
manufacture
,
distribution
,
use
and
eventual
disposal
.
however
,
while
many
consumer
be
willing
to
make
more
sustainable
choice
,
they
face
difficulty
.
for
a
sustainable
purchase
choice
to
become
easy
,
consumer
need
good
information
.
currently
,
there
be
no
commonly
use
and
accept
standard
on
how
to
calculate
or
communicate
a
product
's
carbon
footprint
to
consumer
.
this
be
all
that
the
Bill
seek
to
do
.
we
recognise
and
openly
acknowledge
,
as
do
deputy
Smith
,
the
person
who
write
the
legislation
,
that
this
present
enormous
challenge
for
every
stakeholder
involve
.
regardless
of
where
someone
be
in
the
economy
and
society
,
be
he
or
she
a
farmer
in
north
Cork
,
the
chief
executive
of
a
global
multinational
like
Nestlé
or
the
producer
of
a
sub-supply
part
for
the
aeronautical
sector
in
Shannon
,
it
present
a
major
challenge
.
all
we
be
try
to
do
in
promulgate
this
legislation
-
we
accept
the
government
's
amendment
-
be
to
acknowledge
that
consumer
want
to
make
inform
decision
.
no
one
who
introduce
a
private
Member
's
Bill
profess
to
have
the
wisdom
of
Solomon
when
write
it
.
we
write
we
bill
in
the
expectation
they
can
get
to
committee
stage
to
be
amend
as
need
be
.
we
accept
this
Bill
be
not
a
perfect
document
,
but
it
can
be
make
perfect
if
it
be
give
a
chance
to
proceed
.
we
be
not
entirely
happy
that
the
government
be
seek
a
year
to
do
that
-
I
contend
that
a
year
be
a
long
time
,
but
we
accept
it
on
the
basis
of
the
argument
that
have
be
propose
by
two
minister
of
State
in
respect
of
the
amendment
.
if
I
interpret
they
correctly
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
Deputy
Ossian
Smyth
and
Troy
,
have
state
we
cannot
move
ahead
of
the
EU
because
of
single
market
and
harmonisation
consideration
.
I
understand
the
same
apply
in
the
case
of
the
smoking
ban
and
possibly
the
plastic
bag
levy
-
I
be
unsure
about
the
latter
-
but
we
understand
and
accept
the
principle
.
at
least
we
be
at
a
starting
point
in
a
process
where
there
be
a
acceptance
by
individual
.
I
wish
to
disaggregate
the
principle
of
the
consumer
from
the
principle
of
the
individual
.
we
recognise
that
consumer
be
individual
,
but
people
broadly
have
a
level
of
consciousness
now
about
what
they
be
purchase
and
,
in
use
they
purchase
power
with
they
hard
-
earn
money
,
they
want
to
see
transparency
when
buy
a
product
,
regardless
of
what
that
product
be
,
about
what
its
carbon
footprint
be
.
that
be
not
a
bad
thing
.
rather
,
it
be
inherently
good
.
increasingly
,
we
be
see
behavioural
change
.
we
be
change
we
behaviour
in
we
own
household
in
a
way
that
try
to
contribute
to
the
reduction
of
global
warming
and
cut
greenhouse
gas
emission
.
that
be
all
this
legislation
be
try
to
do
.
if
we
look
at
the
government
's
response
,
what
be
a
little
discomfiting
be
the
fact
we
do
not
have
timeline
for
the
sustainable
product
initiative
or
the
eco
design
directive
,
for
instance
.
neither
do
we
know
how
the
commission
's
2020
circular
economy
action
plan
will
be
promulgate
.
timing
be
important
.
we
do
not
have
time
,
if
that
make
sense
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
partisan
,
but
COP26
be
not
the
end
point
.
rather
,
it
be
the
starting
point
for
the
next
step
forward
.
that
be
why
,
in
introduce
this
legislation
,
we
want
to
maintain
the
momentum
of
what
arise
from
COP26
.
as
such
,
we
be
hopeful
the
timeline
will
be
shorten
and
there
will
be
a
urgency
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
respect
of
its
propose
amendment
.
all
we
be
try
to
do
be
put
in
place
a
framework
.
the
cost
to
small
business
can
be
offset
easily
through
Enterprise
Ireland
,
a
agency
for
which
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Troy
,
have
responsibility
.
we
spend
million
upon
million
of
euro
of
taxpayer
's
money
funding
company
through
Enterprise
Ireland
.
I
know
that
because
I
use
to
sit
where
the
Minister
of
State
be
now
.
I
represent
a
agricultural
community
and
I
speak
,
as
I
be
entitled
to
do
,
for
the
agricultural
community
as
well
.
I
live
in
a
town
that
have
one
of
the
large
milk
processing
plant
in
the
country
.
I
recognise
the
value
of
a
beast
and
of
a
blade
of
grass
as
much
as
the
next
person
.
I
recognise
the
value
of
what
farming
bring
to
this
economy
.
however
,
the
purchaser
of
the
primary
product
,
be
it
a
side
of
beef
,
a
carton
of
milk
,
baby
powder
,
infant
formula
or
yoghurt
,
be
the
Yoplait
,
Nestlé
and
Unilever
and
the
Lidls
,
Aldis
and
other
multiple
,
and
they
be
place
a
downward
pressure
on
the
primary
producer
because
they
be
go
to
start
map
they
carbon
footprint
.
this
will
result
in
the
market
determine
from
whom
inside
the
farm
gate
the
Unilever
,
Nestlé
and
Dairygolds
be
go
to
purchase
.
the
farmer
or
primary
producer
who
have
he
or
she
carbon
footprint
map
will
be
the
person
from
whom
they
will
purchase
.
that
be
the
reality
of
the
market
.
we
have
research
this
extensively
.
through
this
legislation
,
we
be
try
to
give
that
primary
producer
a
fight
chance
so
that
they
can
offset
any
cost
that
they
might
incur
inside
the
farm
gate
.
this
can
easily
be
do
through
Pillar
2
of
the
next
round
of
the
common
agricultural
Policy
,
CAP
,
for
instance
,
by
map
it
into
the
eco
scheme
.
we
can
subsidise
the
effort
of
the
farmer
or
the
cost
of
the
expert
advice
they
might
procure
to
reduce
they
carbon
footprint
.
that
can
be
easily
do
.
it
will
happen
whether
we
like
it
or
not
because
the
consumer
demand
it
,
regardless
of
whether
it
be
do
today
,
tomorrow
or
in
two
or
three
year
'
time
.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
farmer
,
primary
producer
and
small
business
be
give
a
fight
chance
.
we
be
introduce
this
legislation
so
that
we
can
get
this
on
the
agenda
now
and
get
Enterprise
Ireland
,
Teagasc
and
all
the
might
of
the
State
,
through
its
research
and
funding
arm
,
to
support
the
people
who
produce
the
excellent
produce
we
have
in
this
country
and
to
give
they
a
fight
chance
on
this
agenda
.
I
fear
that
if
we
do
not
give
they
a
fighting
chance
,
then
the
likes
of
Unilever
,
Nestlé
,
Lidl
and
Aldi
will
exclude
a
lot
of
the
people
we
be
seek
to
fight
for
.
that
be
why
we
be
introduce
this
Bill
.
we
now
move
to
the
three

from
Sinn
Féin
.
I
call

I

thank
the
Deputy

they
contribution
.
I
will
note
they
.
in
my
previous
response
,
I
take
the
opportunity
to
outline
the
progress
and
consultation
that
have
take
place
to
this
point
.
it
have
be
a
process
of
progress
and
consultation
,
which
be
important
.
as
I
have
already
outline
,
it
be
a
consultation
with
the
wide
possible
representation
of
stakeholder
through
the
advisory
body
.
that
include
student
and
they
have
be
very
much
part
of
the
process
,
which
continue
tomorrow
.
that
be
right
and
proper
.
it
have
be
the
hallmark
of
progress
to
this
point
for
the
leave
certificate
in
2022
and
equally
so
for
that
in
2020
and
2021
.
I
emphasise
that
I
be
acutely
aware
of
the
disruption
cause
to
student
who
be
take
the
exam
in
2022
.
the
Department
will
continue
to
engage
with
education
stakeholder
to
ensure
the
good
interest
of
all
student
be
at
the
heart
of
all
decision
make
relate
to
the

be
ongoing
engagement
in
plan
prior
to
the
return
to
school

plan
be
put
in
place
for
accommodation
to
exam
paper
.
as
I
outline
early

other

such
as
second
sitting
of
exam
and
the
provision
of
exam
at
Easter
outside
of
school
time
will
be
make
.
there
will
be
a
further
opportunity
tomorrow
to
hear
all
voice
and
opinion
at
the
advisory
group
meeting
in
what
have
always
be
a
open
and
constructive
manner
.
a
opportunity
will
be
afford
to
each
of
the
stakeholder
tomorrow
to
articulate
they
view
,
experience
and
representative
thought
and
idea
on
the
next
stage
of
development
for
the
process
.
I
look
forward
to
that
opportunity
.
I
have
always
support
the
opportunity
for
the
wide
possible
stakeholder
engagement
,
include
with
student

it
be
right

proper
that
that
opportunity
be
facilitate
tomorrow
.
now
we
be
back
.
I
offer
my
condolence
to
the
family
of
Ashling
Murphy
.
there
be
no
adequate
word
of
comfort
that
I
can
provide
except
to
say
that
we
be
think
of
she
and
she
family
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
remember
a
young
woman
call
Karen
Buckley
.
Karen
be
murder
in
Scotland
in
April
2015
.
she
be
a
postgraduate
occupational
therapy
student
from
Mourneabbey
,
Mallow
,
County
Cork
.
I
do
not
want
we
to
forget
about
Karen
;
I
want
we
to
remember
she
as
a
person
of
great
character
and
intelligence
and
as
a
warm
and
caring
person
.
we
thought
go
out
to
Karen
's
parent
,
John
and
Marian
,
and
she
brother
and
wide
family
as
we
approach
the
sixth
anniversary
of
she
death
.
it
be
important
that
we
remember
Karen
and
Ashling
,
what
they
family
have
lose
and
what
we
as
a
community
have
lose
through
they
absence
.
the
common
thread
that
bind
Karen
to
Ashling
be
the
great
love
that
they
family
have
for
they
and
they
for
they
family
.
they
be
both
young
woman
,
forge
career
path
in
profession
that
be
by
they
nature
caring
one
and
that
say
so
much
about
they
individual
character
.
today
,
we
remember
they
and
we
must
ensure
that
we
do
not
forget
they
.
if
there
be
one
practical
measure
that
people
in
we
profession
,
the
profession
of
politics
,
can
support
,
it
be
the
Bystander
Intervention
programme
operate
by
University
College
Cork
,
ucc
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
Professor
Louise
Crowley
of
ucc
and
the
bystander
team
.
this
programme
aim
to
educate
and
empower
young
people
to
speak
up
as
a
bystander
when
they
notice
sexual
harassment
and
violence
and
demand
a
zero
-
tolerance
approach
.
it
be
not
enough
that
we
merely
remember
this
young
woman
.
it
be
we
responsibility
to
ensure
that
we
fund
and
support
programme
such
as
the
bystander
intervention
programme
,
which
seek
to
shift
attitude
and
the
culture
of
sexual
harassment
and
violence
against
woman
that
seem
so
endemic
in
we
society
.
I
be
grateful
for
this
opportunity
to
speak
for
a
few
moment
and
to
reiterate
again
that
the
family
of
Ashling
Murphy

of
Karen
Buckley

of
so
many
woman
be
in
we
thought
.

.
at
the
request
of
deputy
O'Connor
,
I
meet
a
number
of
the
school
leader
in
the
area
.
deputy
Buckley
specifically
reference
the
wide
area
of
east
Cork
.
I
be
personally
very
familiar
with
the
area
because
I
spend
time
teach
there
.
I
be
very
conscious
of
its
need
and
demand
give
that
it
be
a
grow
area
.
I
appreciate
the
high
priority
that
be
be
place
on
the
future
of
this
three
-
school
campus
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
the
matter
.
it
will
be
a
significant
achievement
for
Carrigtwohill
Community
College
,
Scoil
Chlíodhna
Community
National
School
and
Scoil
Mhuire
Naofa
National
School
.
it
be
a
very
ambitious
project
and
undertaking
by
the
Department
of
Education
,
and
will
be
the
large
campus
we
have
ever
deliver
.
the
Department
be
acutely
aware
of
the
need
to
provide
modern
permanent
new
school
building
for
this
three
school
and
we
be
act
proactively
to
do
all
that
we
can
to
deliver
this
as
a
matter
of
priority
.
as
the
deputy
have
indicate
,
it
be
very
heartening
for
people
to
see
,
for
example
,
the
road
,
which
be
very
important
for
the
delivery
of
the
project
,
now
near
completion
.
the
deputy
also
highlight
the
other
aspect
.
I
assure
he
that
every
possible
priority
be
be
give
to
the
project
.
as
I
indicate
,
we
be
look
at
the
letter
of
intent
be
issue
in
quarter
1
.
it
be
progress
and
I
know
there
be
great
interest
from
everybody
who
will
benefit
from
it
in
the
locality
and
the
wide
community
.
we
will
continue
to
give
it
the
priority
it
deserve
.
I
be
share
time
with
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
be
quite
tell
,
not
least
when
he
state
,
''
this
be
what
underpin
we
assessment
that
the
current
very
high
rate
of
inflation
be
temporary
and
that
it
will
begin
to
ease
from
the
second
quarter
of
this
year
.
''
we
all
read
the
economic
report
from
the
likes
of
the
economic
and
social
Research
Institute
and
we
be
all
well
verse
on
economic
affair
at
this
stage
.
I
think
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
signal
to
the
House
in
response
to
the
motion
be
that
,
by
and
large
,
the
government
be
hopeful
everything
will
return
to
some
degree
of
normality
,
as
will
the
2.5
%
of
that
5.7
%
increase
attribute
to
the
cost
of
energy
,
but
the
cost
of
energy
run
through
everything
we
do
in
society
.
whether
we
be
buy
a
packet
of
biscuit
or
pasta
,
fuell
we
car
or
heat
we
house
,
it
run
through
everything
we
do
.
I
believe
the
Minister
of
State
's
contribution
be
signal
to
the
House
that
the
government
be
go
to
be
largely
non-interventionist
in
how
it
approach
the
cost
-
of
-
living
increase
.
it
be
hopeful
,
on
a
wing
and
a
prayer
,
that
cost
will
decrease
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
and
,
therefore
,
it
will
not
do
a
whole
pile
about
it
.
that
be
unfortunate
.
at
a
time
when
people
expect
a
response
from
,
and
intervention
by
,
the
government
,
the
response
from
the
Minister
of
State
and
the
government
be
unfortunate
.
there
be
something
discomfite
about
hear
the
traffic
report
from
aa
Roadwatch
on
"
Morning
Ireland
"
early
.
the
tailback
and
delay
at
the
usual
junction
leave
one
with
a
sense
that
the
gain
in
respect
of
quality
of
life
derive
from
people
be
able
to
work
from
home
be
evaporate
before
we
very
eye
.
I
hope
we
will
not
squander
that
gain
on
quality
of
life
and
I
hope
the
considerable
financial
savings
people
have
make
by
work
remotely
will
not
be
wipe
out
by
rise
fuel
cost
,
in
particular
for
that
commuter
stuck
on
major
orbital
route
around
city
such
as
Dublin
,
Cork
and
Limerick
and
many
town
I
could
mention
.
the
Minister
of
State
make
reference
to
the
annual
rate
of
inflation
and
we
all
acknowledge
the
increase
,
which
be
at
a
all
-
time
high
.
even
so
,
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
gain
worker
have
make
from
not
have
to
spend
hour
in
the
car
will
be
wipe
out
by
the
exorbitant
cost
of
petrol
and
diesel
.
there
be
a
opportunity
to
address
the
cost
-
of
-
living
crisis
.
the
Taoiseach
inform
the
House
yesterday
that
he
believe
increase
wage
be
not
the
answer
because
of
what
he
believe
be
the
danger
of
a
wage
price
spiral
lead
to
high
inflation
,
and
the
Minister
of
State
refer
to
the
same
dynamic
.
I
do
not
know
whether
that
be
government
policy
,
give
the
Tánaiste
be
ask
the
private
sector
after
this
week
's
cabinet
meeting
to
increase
wage
.
he
state
,
''
where
employer
can
afford
pay
increase
,
they
should
do
so
.
''
that
be
typical
of
the
mix
messaging
of
the
government
and
its
inability
to
deliver
one
coherent
message
.
the
people
be
listen
closely
to
message
from
the
government
.
incoherence
lead
only
to
further
anxiety
and
this
need
to
be
address
.
the
Taoiseach
do
not
offer
solution
yesterday
when
respond
to
deputy
Kelly
's
raising
of
the
issue
of
spiral
cost
across
the
range
of
goods
and
service
.
through
this
motion
,
we
have
put
forward
some
solution
.
one
such
measure
the
government
could
consider
to
address
the
spiral
cost
of
energy
would
be
to
actively
wide
access
to
the
fuel
allowance
for
household
that
be
fuel
-
impoverished
.
a
low
-
income
household
would
benefit
greatly
from
a
refundable
carbon
tax
credit
and
this
would
signal
a
clear
transfer
from
the
rich
in
society
to
the
poor
work
family
.
another
solution
would
be
to
provide
increase
in
social
protection
payment
that
would
keep
pace
with
the
rate
of
inflation
,
something
that
be
not
do
in
the
most
recent
budget
,
with
a
long
-
term
commitment
to
bring
up
weekly
rate
to
the
minimum
essential
standard
of
living
.
I
do
not
know
whether
Fianna
Fáil
backbencher
be
listen
to
what
business
be
tell
they
at
present
.
I
speak
with
a
primary
producer
in
the
agri
-food
sector
on
Monday
,
who
inform
I
he
monthly
gas
bill
have
increase
from
€
10000
to
€
36000
over
recent
month
.
this
be
really
bite
in
both
rural
and
urban
Ireland
and
it
be
have
a
major
detrimental
effect
on
business
's
ability
to
continue
to
employ
people
,
as
be
highlight
by
deputy
Nash
.
it
be
begin
to
squeeze
the
ability
of
employer
to
employ
people
in
the
economy
,
and
that
have
to
be
take
note
of
.
there
be
two
minute
remain
in
this
slot
.
I
be
anxious
to
allow
deputy
Murnane
O'Connor
to
come
in
and
for
the
Taoiseach
to
respond
.
I
now
call
on
the
Sinn
Féin
Member
,
deputy
McDonald
.
I
understand
she
be
share
time
with
deputy
John
Brady
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
the
motion
concern
the
cost
of
living
.
on
Wednesday
,
26
January

on
the
question
,
"

the

,
a

in
accordance
with
Standing

now
.
I
will
be
brief
.
firstly
,
I
support
the
amendment
.
it
be
a
laudable
one
and
worthy
of
support
.
certainly
,
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
speak
in
support
of
the
amendment
.
when
the
climate
action
Bill
be
before
we
we
seek
to
put
forward
amendment
to
provide
for
specific
sectoral
target
for
afforestation
.
the
Minister
for
the
environment
,
Climate
and
Communication
refuse
to
accept
that
amendment
.
it
be
disappointing
to
say
the
least
.
we
think
it
would
have
be
quite
a
obvious
thing
for
the
minister
,
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
,
to
take
on
board
give
the
pronouncement
from
that
part
of
government
on
the
desire
to
ensure
we
reach
afforestation
target
throughout
the
State
.
I
welcome
,
therefore
,
this
approach
by
Sinn
Féin
which
merely
ask
the
minister
to
lay
a
report
before
Dáil
Éireann
on
the
level
of
afforestation
per
LEA
.
it
be
a
reasonable
amendment
.
when
you
look
at
the
forestry
licensing
dashboard
,
which
have
become
the
tool
we
all
use
for
information
on
the
number
of
afforestation
licence
and
felling
licence
issue
,
we
can
clearly
see
that
while
there
be
a
increase
in
September
,
October
and
November
,
there
be
a
reduction
of
December
.
obviously
,
January
's
figure
have
yet
to
be
publish
.
it
seem
to
I
that
when
you
parse
the
afforestation
licence
that
have
be
grant
,
small
farmer
or
private
landowner
-
mainly
farmer
-
receive
about
26
felling
licence
.
the
vast
bulk
of
they
be
go
to
Coillte
.
it
receive
almost
double
that
amount
,
at
51
licence
and
that
be
a
constant
trend
.
what
I
be
ask
the
minister
to
do
,
in
support
this
amendment
,
be
to
use
he
good
office
to
start
ensure
that
where
planting
licence
,
or
even
felling
licence
-
as
there
be
a
natural
rate
of
felling
as
well
-
be
be
apply
for
,
that
he
remove
the
impediment
to
that
.
there
be
still
too
many
.
I
be
find
that
where
felling
licence
be
be
apply
,
small
farmer
who
own
tract
of
forestry
be
feel
a
inordinate
amount
of
stress
and
strain
in
respect
of
the
process
they
must
go
through
and
the
hoop
they
must
jump
.
they
be
not
rich
people
.
they
be
people
who
plant
in
good
faith
.
they
be
people
who
seek
to
look
to
the
future
.
they
be
people
who
want
to
grow
tree
again
and
reapply
for
afforestation
licence
.
however
,
the
system
still
have
not
work
through
the
issue
that
have
be
so
well
highlight
by
the
agriculture
committee
under
the
chairmanship
of
deputy
Cahill
.
we
be
not
see
enough
of
a
seismic
shift
to
reach
that
afforestation
target
the
government
itself
have
set
.
this
amendment
be
a
very
sensible
one
.
if
the
minister
could
meet
its
proposer
on
this
and
support
the
amendment
it
would
give
we
a
great
degree
of
transparency
and
move
towards
the
setting
of
the
clear
target
that
be
badly
need
if
we
be
to
meet
we
sequestration
goal
,
carbon
reduction
goal
and
all
the
self
-
evident
goal
I
need
not
explain
.
there
be
a
real
willingness
and
desire
now
by
forestry
owner
to
plant
but
there
be
still
too
much
of
a
weighting
against
they
in
term
of
the
bureaucracy
and
the
technocratic
mechanism
that
be
in
place
and
it
be
prevent
that
from
happen
.
if
they
can
be
work
through
it
would
assist
the
process
greatly
.
specificity
be
precisely
what
should
be
govern
primary
legislation
.
this
be
a
specific
amendment
.
it
should
not
be
so
injurious
to
the
minister
that
he
should
not
accept
it
on
the
basis
that
it
be
overly
specific
.
there
be
a
point
to
be
make
here
that
capture
the
political
Zeitgeist
.
that
be
about
how
we
take
carbon
out
of
society
and
the
economy
.
one
of
the
way
to
do
that
be
through
a
active
afforestation
programme
.
the
fact
in
respect
of
the
dashboard
,
which
be
the
toolkit
we
all
use
,
clearly
indicate
that
that
target
will
not
be
meet
.
deputy
Carthy
have
already
state
that
.
we
can
see
it
for
ourselves
.
the
point
of
the
amendment
be
that
it
ask
for
a
level
of
granularity
which
be
not
unreasonable
.
the
Department
be
a
mighty
Department
in
the
sense
that
it
have
many
personnel
.
it
have
a
ever
-
grow
number
of
personnel
,
particularly
relate
to
the
processing
of
afforestation
and
felling
licence
.
it
have
many
expert
now
.
it
would
be
very
easy
for
the
Department
to
carry
out
this
exercise
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
rethink
he
position
.
I
fear
I
be
involved
in
a
futile
exercise
in
that
regard
but
I
ask
that
nonetheless
.
I
rise
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
to
support
the
amendment
.
reference
have
be
make
to
the
former
deputy
and
former
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
,
Pat
the
cope
Gallagher
,
who
hold
the
respect
of
every
single
person
in
this
House
,
both
past
and
present
.
he
speak
with
passion
in
respect
of
SI
89
of
2019
.
he
argue
that
natural
justice
must
be
allow
to
occur
and
that
common
law
rights
should
be
upheld
.
what
be
at
issue
in
this
group
of
amendment
be
the
very
principle
espouse
by
former
deputy
Gallagher
,
who
represent
a
coastal
community
,
who
be
very
close
to
the
fishing
sector
for
so
many
year
and
who
know
it
intimately
.
he
serve
as
a
guide
to
many
of
we
who
be
not
so
well
verse
in
matter
relate
to
the
sector
.
we
be
support
this
amendment
,
quite
frankly
,
because
we
believe
that
the
long
-
establish
principle
in
common
law
of
beyond
reasonable
doubt
should
be
inculcate
into
this
legislation
.
it
be
as
simple
as
that
.
other
speaker
before
I
and
the
proposer
of
the
amendment
have
articulate
that
viewpoint
very
well
.
we
be
debate
this
legislation
in
the
context
of
the
recent
prospect
of
Russian
naval
exercise
take
place
within
we
exclusive
economic
zone
.
the
prospect
of
that
exercise
highlight
and
expose
the
weakness
in
we
defence
force
in
term
of
fishery
patrol
and
the
weakness
inherent
in
we
own
fishery
sector
.
the
idea
that
there
would
be
,
just
yesterday
,
a
European
Fishery
Control
Agency
,
EFCA
,
vessel
dock
in
Cobh
be
anathema
to
that
of
we
who
have
great
respect
for
we
Defence
force
and
specifically
for
we
navy
.
we
now
know
that
the
capacity
of
the
navy
to
patrol
we
own
water
be
just
not
there
.
the
timing
of
this
legislation
be
all
wrong
.
when
I
think
of
the
diplomatic
win
,
a
win
that
be
not
garner
by
the
government
or
any
Department
of
State
but
by
fisher
who
take
on
the
might
of
a
empire
,
I
be
remind
of
the
Skibbereen
Eagle
take
on
the
might
of
the
Tsar
of
Russia
.
there
be
a
certain
symbolism
in
that
,
in
the
way
that
people
like
Patrick
Murphy
and
Brendan
Byrne
take
on
the
might
of
the
Russian
navy
.
it
make
I
proud
to
be
Irish
,
that
this
humble
people
be
defend
not
only
the
rights
of
fisher
but
also
defend
the
environment
and
the
sustainability
of
the
sector
that
they
represent
.
they
be
represent
family
and
individual
who
seek
to
ply
they
trade
,
make
that
catch
and
make
the
few
shilling
to
keep
life
and
soul
together
.
it
be
a
fantastic
example
of
David
and
Goliath
.
the
minister
be
propose
legislation
that
seek
to
further
trammel
the
rights
of
that
very
same
people
.
if
I
be
advise
the
minister
,
with
the
minister
himself
have
take
such
a
strident
view
on
this
very
legislation
when
he
be
in
opposition
,
I
would
ask
he
to
roll
back
a
little
on
it
,
to
take
further
counsel
and
not
to
go
down
this
route
in
regard
to
the
legislation
.
this
be
precisely
because
,
as
be
articulate
in
pre-legislative
scrutiny
,
the
issue
of
reasonable
doubt
,
which
be
a
concept
that
prevail
in
the
common
law
system
,
be
not
present
here
.
while
support
this
amendment
,
I
fear
we
be
go
to
criminalise
further
ordinary
man
and
woman
.
it
be
the
State
lean
too
heavily
on
ordinary
man
and
woman
.
the
minister
need
to
revise
he
position
on
this
.
in
response
to
the
minister
,
I
appreciate
the
point
that
this
be
a
administrative
scheme
and
that
the
concept
of
the
balance
of
probability
be
apply
.
I
remain
open
to
the
expertise
of
the
minister
's
own
official
,
give
that
they
have
spend
much
time
go
to
and
from
Brussels
over
the
year
.
be
due
cognisance
take
of
the
fact
that
we
be
in
a
common
law
system
?
whether
or
not
there
be
a
criminal
sanction
for
the
application
of
a
penalty
point
system
,
fisher
feel
put
upon
,
whether
through
decommissioning
scheme
or
the
outworking
of
negotiation
at
intergovernmental
level
in
respect
of
Britain
's
exit
from
the
European
Union
.
there
be
frustration
on
the
part
of
fisher
that
they
be
get
a
small
and
small
part
of
the
pot
with
every
successive
negotiation
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
the
frustration
of
the
Opposition
as
it
seek
to
introduce
amendment
of
this
nature
?
it
be
try
to
ensure
that
if
a
penalty
point
system
be
introduce
,
it
do
not
further
impose
upon
the
fisher
and
they
be
not
put
upon
.
can
the
minister
understand
where
fisher
be
come
from
?
they
feel
as
if
there
be
a
slow
and
gradual
erosion
of
they
livelihood
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
too
rhetorical
about
it
.
in
the
language
of
law
,
this
be
a
administrative
scheme
,
with
a
penalty
point
system
,
but
fisherman
perceive
it
-----
-----
and
want
they
feeling
to
be
acknowledge
that
they
perceive
it
as
be
yet
another
heavy
-
hand
state
intervention
.
if
this
legislation
be
about
a
EU
harmonisation
of
sanction
,
be
the
30
day
the
de
facto
position
across
all
member
state
?
be
each
member
state
implement
a
30
-
day
regime
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
so
be
it
;
there
be
consistency
.
however
,
we
plead
mitigation
in
this
circumstance
.
give
the
particular
variation
in
a
Irish
scenario
where
fisherman
be
fishing
quite
far
from
they
home
base
,
as
have
be
articulate
by
deputy
Pringle
,
there
be
scope
to
plead
for
some
mitigation
to
allow
for
a
great
number
of
day
to
be
provide
when
prepare
one
's
case
,
as
it
be
.
that
be
simply
what
the
amendment
seek
to
do
.
be
the
government
tie
to
the
30
day
so
as
to
be
ad
idem
with
the
position
of
other
member
states
or
do
the
government
have
scope
in
how
it
transpose
the
EU
rule
?
I
ask
the
Minister
a
specific
question
so
as
to
seek
enlightenment
on
the
justification
for
the
30
day
and
he
have
come
back
to
we
on
that
.
I
ask
specifically
whether
that
be
consistent
with
other
member
state
's
position
in
respect
of
prepare
case
and
whether
there
be
scope
,
because
of
the
particular
condition
that
exist
in
a
Irish
context
,
for
a
moving
of
that
beyond
the
30
day
.
it
be
really
more
from
the
point
of
view
of
seek
information
that
I
pose
the
question
.
I
just
want
to
see
what
the
member
state
's
position
be
in
respect
of
the
30
day
.
be
there
great
scope
for
furtherance
of
that
position
?

I
raise
this
issue
because
I
be
extremely
concerned
that
the
Department
be
now
pull
back
community
welfare
service
where
they
be
deliver
in
face
-
to
-
face
setting
in
the
most
local
of
centre
,
particularly
in
rural
area
.
base
on
what
I
have
hear
so
far
,
my
fear
be
that
the
minister
be
not
renew
any
lease
that
she
Department
may
have
have
with
the
HSE
for
the
delivery
of
this
service
in
what
be
call
traditional
dispensary
or
health
centre
.
what
be
the
minister
's
position
on
this
matter
?
I
be
try
to
listen
carefully
to
the
language
of
the
minister
's
reply
.
I
be
not
reassure
by
it
.
the
premise
on
which
I
base
my
question
be
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
interact
face
to
face
with
a
officer
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
for
clarification
because
I
be
hear
that
she
Department
be
not
renew
lease
in
respect
of
certain
traditional
centre
such
as
health
centre
which
deliver
in
community
and
in
the
most
rural
area
.
be
that
the
case
?
all
Deputy
represent
the
poor
and
the
most
vulnerable
.
we
accept
the
fact
that
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
system
be
a
excellent
system
because
it
deliver
to
the
poor
.
we
know
that
the
minister
's
Department
give
nearly
€
43
million
in
exceptional
and
urgent
need
payment
in
2021
.
my
fear
now
be
that
for
the
citizen
who
do
not
have
access
to
the
near
town
,
who
traditionally
might
have
have
access
in
the
local
village
where
there
be
a
visit
community
welfare
officer
in
the
local
health
centre
,
that
system
will
stop
.
if
that
stop
it
just
take
the
citizen
that
bit
further
away
from
the
service
.
again
I
ask
the
minister
if
it
be
she
Department
's
intention
not
to
renew
lease
with
the
HSE
.
it
be
one
department
renew
with
a
government
agency
like
the
HSE
,
State
to
State
.
be
it
factually
the
case
that
the
minister
be
not
renew
that
lease
with
the
HSE
in
respect
of
the
delivery
of
service
in
certain
centre
around
the
country
?

leave

of
leave
the

's
colleague

deputy
o
Murchú
,
enough
time
and
give
the
deputy
a
opportunity
to
wind
down

contribution

the

this
be
just
to
ensure
that
the
three
speaker
have
time
in

slot

I
call
deputy
Ó
Murchú
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
committee
on
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment

I

(
a
)
and
181(

.
my
question
be
more
thematic
in
the
sense
that
we
be
focus
heavily
now
on
afforestation
target
and
the
toolkit
that
be
the
dashboard
.
it
have
become
the
tool
everybody
now
use
as
the
benchmark
for
progress
on
afforestation
target
.
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
and
the
cost
of
input
be
allude
to
early
and
concern
around
fertiliser
be
also
wrap
up
in
this
question
.
have
the
minister
now
abandon
the
afforestation
target
of
8,000
ha
per
year
?
that
be
ultimately
the
question
I
wish
to
hear
answer
.
that
be
bind
up
in
the
specific
question
I
have
ask
.
I
invite
the
Minister
of
State
to
give
we
she
personal
perspective
on
afforestation
.
I
would
be
delighted
to
hear
it
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
she
answer
.
the
announcement
of
a
target
of
1040
licence
for
2022
indicate
to
I
that
the
forest
service
have
abandon
the
target
of
planting
8,000
ha
this
year
.
tracking
back
over
the
number
from
recent
year
,
the
issuing
of
1040
licence
would
result
in
the
planning
of
only
4000
ha
.
I
be
not
convinced
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
be
,
that
all
of
the
stakeholder
through
Project
Woodland
be
as
enthusiastic
about
the
future
of
forestry
policy
.
I
think
some
of
that
stakeholder
be
become
increasingly
frustrated
by
the
lack
of
ambition
.
I
would
certainly
like
to
work
with
the
Minister
of
State
to
see
how
we
can
be
more
ambitious
in
attain
and
achieve
that
target
,
precisely
for
the
reason
she
have
outline
in
respect
of
carbon
sequestration
and
a
proper
policy
intervention
.
I
put
it
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
however
,
that
the
lack
of
ambition
here
be
disappointing
.
I
mean
that
genuinely
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
extremely
genuine
in
what
she
seek
to
achieve
.
there
be
no
doubt
about
that
in
my
mind
.
dire
I
suggest
,
respectfully
,
there
be
a
level
of
granularity
that
need
to
be
work
through
.
that
must
be
acknowledge
.
the
minister
of
State
say
the
Department
will
reach
the
8,000
ha
target
this
year
.
that
remain
to
be
see
.
I
suggest
respectfully
that
the
stakeholder
be
not
see
the
reality
of
that
in
the
issuance
of
new
afforestation
licence
.
the
proof
of
that
be
in
the
toolkit
,
which
be
the
dashboard
.
the
aspiration
might
be
there
but
the
evidence
of
the
practical
outworking
of
reach
the
afforestation
target
be
not
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
indeed
all
Deputy
who
come
and
participate
in
this
debate
.
I
greatly
appreciate
they
interest
,
support
and
contribution
.
I
especially
thank
they
for
the
personal
reflection
they
bring
to
the
House
.
to
reflect
on
one
's
own
experience
be
not
always
a
easy
thing
to
do
,
particularly
in
a
forum
like
this
,
but
it
do
help
tell
that
story
about
why
it
be
important
.
we
tell
the
story
of
we
constituent
,
but
to
advance
and
evolve
we
democracy
it
be
important
to
sometimes
reflect
on
the
personal
experience
we
have
have
.
there
be
absolutely
no
point
in
come
in
,
pull
up
the
ladder
and
pretend
it
be
easy
to
be
here
when
it
be
not
.
we
need
to
be
honest
with
people
and
say
we
do
it
,
we
see
this
issue
,
we
face
the
challenge
,
we
get
on
and
we
try
to
fix
they
but
we
do
it
anyway
and
they
can
too
.
this
be
all
about
try
to
bring
more
people
into
this
chamber
,
try
to
be
more
inclusive
and
reach
out
further
and
further
.
we
have
have
a
very
good
parliamentary
structure
that
have
serve
we
extremely
well
but
we
democracy
be
essentially
always
incomplete
.
there
be
always
more
to
do
and
more
that
can
be
improve
upon
.
it
be
naturally
incomplete
if
half
the
population
be
not
represent
here
in
a
reasonable
way
over
time
.
that
have
never
be
the
case
and
we
need
to
take
the
step
we
can
to
get
to
that

the

it
be
hard
to
see
some
of
that
and
think

that
we

that

when

bring

it

we

there
be
more

to

have
about
the

I
understand
the
complexity

include
the
concern
around
the

I

they
interest

I
especially
thank
they
for
the
personal
reflection
they
bring
to
the
House
.
to
reflect
on
one
's
own
experience
be
not
always
a
easy
thing
to
do
,
particularly
in
a
forum
like
this
,
but
it
do
help
tell
that
story
about
why
it
be
important
.
we
tell
the
story
of
we
constituent
,
but
to
advance
and
evolve
we
democracy
it
be
important
to
sometimes
reflect
on
the
personal
experience
we
have
have
.
there
be
absolutely
no
point
in
come
in
,
pull
up
the
ladder
and
pretend
it
be
easy
to
be
here
when
it
be
not
.
we
need
to
be
honest
with
people
and
say
we
do
it
,
we
see
this
issue
,
we
face
the
challenge
,
we
get
on
and
we
try
to
fix
they
but
we
do
it
anyway
and
they
can
too
.
this
be
all
about
try
to
bring
more
people
into
this
chamber
,
try
to
be
more
inclusive
and
reach
out
further
and
further
.
we
have
have
a
very
good
parliamentary
structure
that
have
serve
we
extremely
well
but
we
democracy
be
essentially
always
incomplete
.
there
be
always
more
to
do
and
more
that
can
be
improve
upon
.
it
be
naturally
incomplete
if
half
the
population
be
not
represent
here
in
a
reasonable
way
over
time
.
that
have
never
be
the
case
and
we
need
to
take
the
step
we
can
to
get
to
that
point

debate
,
for
participate
and
for
be
as
encouraging
and
supportive
as
they
have
be
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
indeed
all
Deputy
who
come
and
participate
in
this
debate
.
I
greatly
appreciate
they
interest
,
support
and
contribution
.
I
especially
thank
they
for
the
personal
reflection
they
bring
to
the
House
.
to
reflect
on
one
's
own
experience
be
not
always
a
easy
thing
to
do
,
particularly
in
a
forum
like
this
,
but
it
do
help
tell
that
story
about
why
it
be
important
.
we
tell
the
story
of
we
constituent
,
but
to
advance
and
evolve
we
democracy
it
be
important
to
sometimes
reflect
on
the
personal
experience
we
have
have
.
there
be
absolutely
no
point
in
come
in
,
pull
up
the
ladder
and
pretend
it
be
easy
to
be
here
when
it
be
not
.
we
need
to
be
honest
with
people
and
say
we
do
it
,
we
see
this
issue
,
we
face
the
challenge
,
we
get
on
and
we
try
to
fix
they
but
we
do
it
anyway
and
they
can
too
.
this
be
all
about
try
to
bring
more
people
into
this
chamber
,
try
to
be
more
inclusive
and
reach
out
further
and
further
.
we
have
have
a
very
good
parliamentary
structure
that
have
serve
we
extremely
well
but
we
democracy
be
essentially
always
incomplete
.
there
be
always
more
to
do
and
more
that
can
be
improve
upon
.
it
be
naturally
incomplete
if
half
the
population
be
not
represent
here
in
a
reasonable
way
over
time
.
that
have
never
be
the
case
and
we
need
to
take
the
step
we
can
to
get
to
that
point
.
democracy
,
and
we
institution
of
democracy
,
must
keep
pace
with
we
need
to
reflect
the
will
of
we
people
and
the
thing
that
be
important
to
they
.
where
we
find
barrier
we
must
take
step
to
try
to
address
they
.
this
be
simply
a
effort
to
do
that
.
I
recognise
how
complex
it
be
.
I
recognise
the
read
-
across
constitutionally
.
I
recognise
the
academic
debate
around
it
,
that
be
,
whether
it
be
necessary
,
the
read
-
across
on
the
question
of
parliamentary
privilege
and
how
that
be
link
.
deputy
Howlin
also
mention
that
to
I
.
it
be
,
of
course
,
part
of
the
same
conversation
.
my
effort
be
to
try
to
begin
to
tackle
that
initial
barrier
and
ask
what
be
it
,
at
its
core
,
that
we
must
be
here
for
that
be
perhaps
a
barrier
to
maternity
,
paternity
and
sick
leave
.
the
answer
be
,
of
course
,
voting
.
I
hope
nobody
would
take
from
this
that
I
do
not
see
it
as
important
to
be
here
.
be
here
and
stand
here
be
the
privilege
of
my
professional
career
.
it
be
so
enjoyable
.
it
be
such
a
privilege
to
be
able
to
participate
,
to
vote
,
to
be
part
of
the
parliamentary
structure
and
to
serve
constituent
.
at
the
same
time
,
I
recognise
that
for
the
institution
to
evolve
and
become
strong
and
good
and
for
more
people
to
come
easily
into
that
structure
they
must
be
question
,
challenge
and
help
to
evolve
as
time
go
on
.
as
the
Minister
of
State
,
Deputy
Bacik
,
Ó
Snodaigh
and
other
have
say
,
this
thing
must
happen
together
.
there
be
a
confluence
of
event
at
the
moment
that
require
,
as
Dr.
Catherine
Day
say
at
the
citizen
's
assembly
,
real
seismic
change
around
some
of
this
issue
.
there
be
that
opportunity
but
only
if
we
take
that
point
and
run
with
they
.
I
note
what
deputy
Richmond
mention
about
the
poll
on
thejournal
.ie
,
which
be
interesting
.
of
course
,
it
be
easy
to
give
a
quick
reaction
to
something
like
that
,
such
as
a
quick
question
on
whether
you
be
in
favour
of
or
against
something
.
the
deputy
be
talk
about
some
of
the
comment
on
it
.
it
be
hard
to
see
some
of
that
and
think
people
might
believe
we
do
not
really
want
to
do
the
work
or
that
we
be
not
very
happy
to
be
here
.
of
course
we
be
.
it
be
not
about
make
life
easy
for
politician
.
it
be
about
open
up
the
Parliament
to
more
people
and
make
it
easy
for
they
to
be
here
.
it
be
about
open
up
rather
than
try
to
protect
or
serve
ourselves
.
we
have
have
separate
conversation
about
the
need
for
more
female
representation
and
very
strong
debate
on
that
to
the
effect
that
there
must
be
more
woman
in
politics
and
that
woman
in
politics
must
be
facilitate
,
and
there
be
the
debate
around
the
minister
,
deputy
McEntee
,
and
the
particular
challenge
she
face
as
a
cabinet
minister
.
that
be
all
very
well
but
when
one
bring
this
measure
to
try
to
realise
some
of
that
ambition
,
and
indeed
when
they
be
bring
forward
by
woman
such
as
myself
or
deputy
Bacik
as
part
of
the
committee
or
Dr.
Day
as
part
of
the
assembly
,
rationally
,
it
be
important
that
be
support
or
at
least
discuss
in
a
serious
way
as
step
.
that
be
the
debate
we
have
have
here
.
I
greatly
welcome
it
.
it
be
a
genuinely
positive
debate
about
a
effort
to
be
constructive
.
we
will
see
how
we
can
take
it
forward
through
committee
stage
.
there
be
more
debate
to
be
have
about
the
wording
.
I
understand
the
complexity
of
that
,
include
the
concern
around
the
Attorney
General
and
the
read
-
across
about
other
issue
.
that
be
debate
we
can
have
and
be
open
to
have
.
I

I

both
in

in

I
will
continue

it
be
my
judgment
that
if

by
the
strength

even
though

then
my

deputy
Boyd

be
correct
that
the
EU
have
respond
in

extraordinary
way
to
the
shocking
violence
that
we
be
see
as
war
be
wage
on
Ukraine
from
Russia
.
it
have
be
a
extraordinary
response
.
I
have
never
see
anything
like
it
in
my
23
year
of
politics
link
to
the
Union
.
if
we
could
respond
like
that
to
other
conflict
around
the
world
,
whether
in
Yemen
,
Ethiopia
over
the
past
year
,
Afghanistan
or
Syria
,
that
would
be
a
powerful
thing
.
if
we
could
create
that
kind
of
consensus
,
drive
and
influence
in
the
context
of
encourage
and
push
for
peace
in
the
Middle

,
that
would
be
a

too
,

to
achieve
that

have
to
be
achieve

at

the

not

we
can
create
momentum
around

create
a

that

the
kind
of
momentum
that
we
have
create
in
the
context
of
the
horror
of
the
war
in
Ukraine
right
now
.
the
approach
that
I
defend
and
take
be
one
of
engagement
with
a
Israeli
government
that
be
highly
diverse
and
that
have
multiple
partner
to
it
,
include
Arab
partner

I
have
invest
in
try

build
a
relationship
with
the
Israeli
foreign
Minister

and
I
make
no
apology
for
that
.
that
be
what
Ireland
should
be
do
as
a
member
of
the
international

and
as
a
country
that
want
to
change
Israeli
policy
towards
Palestinian

I
will
also
work
with
other
in
a

to
try

in

in

,
we
be
a

that
continue

Palestinian

a
humanitarian
perspective
.
I
remain
a
strong
advocate
for
UNRWA
,
as
other
try

so

this

we
have
commit

of

we

from
everybody
else
and
create
a
impression
that
Ireland
be
out
on
its
own
.
that
be
the
difference
in
the
approach
between
I
and
many
of
the
Member
opposite
.
it
be
a
judgment
call
politically
in
how
we
should
approach
that
.
I
agree
with
deputy
Berry
,
whom
I
know
have
serve
time
in
the
Middle
East
,
and
have
be
in
either
UNIFIL
or
UNDOF
,
or
perhaps
both
.
one
of
the
reason
Irish
people
be
so
knowledgeable
and
interested
in
this
part
of
the
world
be
because
close
to
50
%
of
we
Defence
force
have
serve
in
UNIFIL
or
UNDOF
at
some
point
in
they
career
.
that
drive
more
knowledge
and
concern
and
a
sense
of
injustice
across
society
in
term
of
what
continue
to
happen
across
the
Middle
East
,
in
particular
towards
the
Palestinian
.
do
I
believe
a
two
-
state
solution
be
still
possible
?
yes
,
I
do
.
do
I
believe
that
people
be
actively
look
to
undermine
it
as
week
and
month
go
by
?
yes
,
I
do
.
be
I
worried
about
the
possible
illegality
of
the
recent
announcement
by
the
Israeli
government
on
the
strategic
nature
of
the
late
settlement
expansion
that
be
be
announce
to
essentially
cut
off
Palestinian
community
from
each
other
in
the
context
of
a
future
Palestinian
state
?
yes
,
I
be
worried
about
that
.
yes
,
it
be
illegal
,
and
,
yes
,
I
call
it
out
.
do
I
want
to
engage
with
a
Israeli
government
?
yes
,
I
do
as
well
.
do
I
want
to
work
with
the
Palestinian
Authority
to
create
a
more
credible
political
leadership
across
Palestine
?
yes
,
I
want
to
do
that
too
.
I
have
be
work
with
other
country
to
try
to
help
do
that
,
both
in
the
region
and
in
the
EU
and
elsewhere
.
I
will
continue
to
do
that
.
it
be
my
judgment
that
if
we
isolate
ourselves
by
the
strength
of
language
that
we
use
at
this
stage
,
even
though
we
may
passionately
believe
in
that
,
then
my
job
become
more
difficult
in
try
to
create
that
consensus
.
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
be
correct
that
the
EU
have
respond
in
a
extraordinary
way
to
the
shocking
violence
that
we
be
see
as
war
be
wage
on
Ukraine
from
Russia
.
it
have
be
a
extraordinary
response
.
I
have
never
see
anything
like
it
in
my
23
year
of
politics
link
to
the
Union
.
if
we
could
respond
like
that
to
other
conflict
around
the
world
,
whether
in
Yemen
,
Ethiopia
over
the
past
year
,
Afghanistan
or
Syria
,
that
would
be
a
powerful
thing
.
if
we
could
create
that
kind
of
consensus
,
drive
and
influence
in
the
context
of
encourage
and
push
for
peace
in
the
Middle
East
,
that
would
be
a
powerful
thing
too
,
but
to
achieve
that
,
consensus
have
to
be
achieve
,
or
at
least
partial
consensus
by
build
a
alliance
of
country
that
be
willing
to
push
in
that
direction
.
Ireland
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
impose
sanction
on
its
own
.
Ireland
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
impose
a
arm
embargo
on
its
own
,
not
that
we
sell
arm
anyway
,
but
we
can
create
momentum
around
that
kind
of
activity
by
create
a
narrative
that
be
agree
by
other
country
in
the
EU
.
that
build
momentum
-
the
kind
of
momentum
that
we
have
create
in
the
context
of
the
horror
of
the
war
in
Ukraine
right
now
.
the
approach
that
I
defend
and
take
be
one
of
engagement
with
a
Israeli
government
that
be
highly
diverse
and
that
have
multiple
partner
to
it
,
include
Arab
partner
.
I
have
invest
in
try
to
build
a
relationship
with
the
Israeli
foreign
Minister
,
and
I
make
no
apology
for
that
.
that
be
what
Ireland
should
be
do
as
a
member
of
the
international
community
and
as
a
country
that
want
to
change
Israeli
policy
towards
Palestinian
.
I
will
also
work
with
other
in
a
effort
to
try
to
build
momentum
in
that
space
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
a
country
that
continue
to
support
Palestinian
from
a
humanitarian
perspective
.
I
remain
a
strong
advocate
for
UNRWA
,
as
other
try
to
undermine
its
credibility
as
a
organisation
.
so
far
this
year
,
we
have
commit
€
6
million
to
UNRWA
and
we
may
commit
more
.
I
think
it
be
€9
million
last
year
.
I
see
the
extraordinary
benefit
of
UNRWA
through
education
,
healthcare
,
income
distribution
and
so
on
that
UNRWA
continue
to
provide
.
I
accept
the
strength
of
feeling
and
also
much
of
what
be
outline
in
this
Amnesty
report
.
we
will
study
it
.
we
will
study
the
recommendation
and
conclusion
of
that
report
and
I
expect
we
will
use
it
to
influence
the
approach
that
we
take
towards
try
to
protect
and
encourage
a
peace
process
that
can
deliver
a
two
-
state
solution
,
which
be
absolutely
the
government
's
priority
in
this
debate
.
I
be
share
time
with
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
.
I
welcome
and
will
support
the
motion
.
if
the
government
be
to
read
the
wording
properly
,
it
would
see
it
"
reject
as
inadequate
the
government
proposal
in
the
general
scheme
of
the
right
to
request
remote
work
Bill
,
on
the
grounds
that
they
:
fail
to
provide
that
access
to
flexible
work
should
be
the
default
entitlement
and
not
the
exception
;
[
and
]
fail
to
include
a
presumption
that
if
work
have
be
do
remotely
during
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
it
be
reasonably
practicable
for
it
to
continue
to
be
do
remotely
"
.
what
we
be
argue
for
,
and
what
be
the
unanimous
approach
of
the
Opposition
,
be
to
reflect
the
fact
there
have
be
a
paradigm
shift
in
society
,
which
have
have
a
major
benefit
,
not
least
for
woman
.
I
might
give
the
practical
example
of
a
woman
who
work
in
the
pharmaceutical
sector
.
she
be
a
lone
parent
,
highly
skilled
and
educate
.
early
in
the
Covid
pandemic
,
she
obtain
a
promotion
.
her
employer
now
say
she
be
expect
to
work
overnight
shift
in
other
part
of
the
country
.
give
she
receive
a
promotion
during
the
pandemic
when
she
be
able
to
take
care
of
she
childcare
responsibility
,
surely
she
should
have
a
right
to
continue
to
work
as
she
have
be
do
and
not
to
have
to
work
that
overnight
shift
.
there
be
a
risk
she
will
now
have
to
leave
that
job
because
she
will
not
be
able
to
make
alternative
childcare
arrangement
.
all
we
be
try
to
do
be
to
instil
a
presumption
in
favour
of
the
right
to
have
a
flexible
arrangement
.
if
nothing
else
,
it
be
to
ensure
lone
parent
,
in
particular
,
who
want
to
work
but
who
cannot
do
so
at
present
because
of
they
childcare
arrangement
will
be
give
that
opportunity
to
be
able
to
do
so
,
such
as
in
the
case
of
the
person
I
mention
.
the
government
's
legislation
,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
will
yank
that
out
of
the
equation
.
it
be
too
weak
.
the
paradigm
shift
have
occur
,
as
he
will
have
see
on
he
commute
to
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
from
wherever
he
reside
,
as
will
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Troy
,
when
he
travel
along
the
m4
.
they
will
see
that
people
be
back
on
the
road
,
go
to
work
.
the
whole
place
be
snarl
up
and
many
of
that
people
would
be
just
as
productive
if
work
from
home
or
have
that
flexibility
,
but
the
government
's
legislative
proposal
be
too
weak
.
we
argue
that
the
Bill
fail
to
live
up
to
the
ambition
of
the
remote
work
strategy
publish
last
year
.
the
government
have
water
it
down
.
let
we
give
woman
,
in
particular
,
and
man
a
chance
.
I
refer
to
woman
who
have
attain
some
autonomy
,
be
able
to
come
back
into
the
workplace
and
achieve
promotion
,
and
who
otherwise
would
not
have
be
promote
because
of
that
pull
towards
the
need
to
provide
childcare
and
the
domestic
arrangement
they
may
have
.
let
we
give
they
a
chance
and
emb
it
as
a
right
.
female
full
-
time
employment
increase
by
a
impressive
7.5
%
in
the
two
-
year
period
between
the
end
of
2019
and
the
end
of
2021
.
that
be
as
a
result
of
the
pandemic
because
people
be
able
to
make
more
flexible
arrangement
.
all
we
be
ask
for
be
a
bit
of
common
sense
.
there
be
a
significant
opportunity
to
reflect
the
Zeitgeist
.
person
want
flexible
working
time
,
instil
as
a
right
,
and
we
motion
speak
to
that
.
it
be
withdraw
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
speak
on
this
motion
.
just
today
,
I
speak
to
a
94
-
year
-
old
man
who
,
with
he
wife
,
be
in
receipt
of
a
occupational
pension
.
they
do
not
pass
the
means
test
for
the
fuel
allowance
.
last
week
,
I
speak
with
a
couple
of
retirement
age
who
have
a
combine
working
life
of
84
year
between
they
,
and
they
do
not
fulfil
the
criterion
for
the
fuel
allowance
.
the
common
denominator
there
be
that
both
couple
work
hard
all
of
they
life
,
raise
family
and
pay
they
contribution
to
the
State
.
they
feel
marginalised
and
hard
do
by
in
the
midst
of
this
crisis
because
the
fuel
allowance
will
not
cover
they
.
I
will
not
advise
they
to
go
to
a
community
welfare
officer
for
a
exceptional
need
payment
because
they
be
not
that
type
of
people
.
they
be
proud
people
and
they
feel
that
the
contribution
they
have
make
through
they
taxation
should
be
enough
to
allow
for
access
,
albeit
it
might
be
on
a
temporary
basis
while
this
crisis
be
ongoing
,
to
some
recognition
by
the
state
of
they
need
and
the
cost
they
be
incur
,
particularly
on
fuel
.
I
mention
the
94
-
year
-
old
gentleman
.
he
be
most
lucid
and
he
mind
be
as
sharp
as
it
ever
be
but
he
body
be
not
where
he
would
like
it
to
be
.
he
say
to
I
today
that
he
have
to
keep
the
heating
on
because
of
the
type
of
medication
he
be
on
.
the
money
be
flow
out
of
the
door
,
so
much
so
that
the
couple
be
incur
personal
debt
.
he
say
to
I
that
if
the
fuel
allowance
be
expand
,
albeit
on
a
temporary
basis
,
to
allow
for
he
circumstance
and
that
of
he
wife
,
it
would
allow
he
to
maintain
he
dignity
and
pride
with
a
temporary
payment
to
get
he
over
this
challenge
.
we
all
recognise
that
there
be
external
force
at
play
and
nobody
would
deny
that
but
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
people
who
be
not
fulfil
the
criterion
for
fuel
allowance
and
who
be
live
in
fuel
impoverished
household
.
they
should
not
have
to
wait
for
the
national
retrofit
scheme
,
which
Age
Action
Ireland
tell
we
we
will
take
at
least
eight
year
to
meet
its
full
target
.
God
only
know
where
my
94
-
year
-
old
man
will
be
at
that
stage
of
he
life
.
we
should
at
least
put
something
in
place
now
by
way
of
a
expansion
or
extension
beyond
the
372
household
that
the
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
announce
on
14
March
.
I
note
that
the
Minister
of
State
mention
390
household
in
he
speech
so
there
be
a
contradiction
of
18000
house
there
and
there
have
be
a
inflation
of
figure
between
Department
since
14
March
.
notwithstanding
that
,
there
be
a
simple
ask
here
.
this
be
work
people
who
pay
massive
tax
to
the
State
in
the
1970
and
1980
and
make
massive
sacrifice
to
put
they
child
through
college
.
many
of
this
people
they
child
be
the
first
generation
of
child
in
they
family
to
go
to
university
or
third
level
institution
.
we
must
recognise
the
predicament
they
be
in
and
we
should
not
force
they
to
have
to
go
to
a
community
welfare
officer
.
the
State
,
through
its
Department
,
should
recognise
that
predicament
and
extend
the
fuel
allowance
,
albeit
as
a
temporary
measure
,
to
get
they
over
the
challenge
they
face
because
along
with
the
increase
in
cost
as
have
be
articulate
by
many
member
,
there
be
also
the
increase
in
the
price
of
food
.
all
of
this
people
be
on
fix
income
and
they
do
not
want
to
eat
into
they
credit
union
savings
because
by
and
large
,
this
savings
be
what
this
people
have
leave
to
bury
themselves
in
some
instance
.
the
savings
will
be
use
to
meet
emergency
family
crisis
need
or
to
bury
themselves
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
they
in
a
situation
where
they
have
to
dip
into
that
savings
.
there
be
scope
for
the
government
to
introduce
a
scheme
of
this
nature
and
I
ask
that
the
Minister
of
State
would
take
that
on
board
.
Seanad
Éireann
have

have
the

?
will
the

what

he
Department
be
take
to
ensure

mechanism
be
in
place
and
accessible
to

English
or
Irish
speaker
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
I
be
concerned
that
there
have
be
22
referral
,
but
I
be
reassure
that
a
designate
social
worker
team
have
be
assign
.
can
the
minister
indicate
if
such
team
be
assign
at
all
point
of
entry
?
there
have
be
much
talk
about
Dublin
and
Rosslare
,
but
Ukrainian
people
be
,
to
a
less
extent
,
come
in
through
Shannon
and
Cork
airport
.
I
wish
to
seek
assurance
that
similar
team
be
be
put
in
place
at
that
point
of
entry
as
well
.
the
important
thing
for
all
of
we
be
that
child
be
be
pick
up
by
the
system
.
that
be
the
most
important
thing
because
it
would
reassure
we
.
I
pay
tribute
to
the
people
of
Buttevant
in
my
native
Cork
,
who
wrap
they

around
approximately

have

into

community
there
in
recent
day
.
community
be
rallying
to
support
family
and
the
effort
there
have
be
tremendous
.
if
we
be
look
for
a
model
of
community
response
,
the
Buttevant
experience
would
be
a
excellent
exemplar
for
such
a
model
.
the
Department
of
social
Protection
and
other
statutory
agency
be
begin
to
respond
to
the
need
of
people
in
Buttevant
.
I
take
that
town
as
a
example
of
other
similar
community
throughout
the
country
.
I
ask
that
Tusla
would
make
itself
know
to
that
type
of
effort
to
ensure
that
where
child

psychological
service
,
for

that

in
accordance
with
standing
Order
80
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
next
week
.
I
welcome
the
motion
,
which
we
will
absolutely
support
.
I
note
that
the
government
be
not
go
to
oppose
it
.
if
I
may
,
I
will
quote
directly
from
my
copy
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
.
when
talk
about
make
the
service
more
effective
and
the
cDNT
,
he
refer
to
what
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
have
say
,
which
be
that
:
...
the
HSE
's
messaging
around
this
have
not
be
clear
and
it
have
be
perceive
as
shift
more
responsibility
on
to
parent
.
while
all
family
be
willing
to
do
they
very
good
for
they
child
,
parent
or
guardian
be
not
therapist
.
the
family
-
cent
approach
must
be
underpin
,
support
and
facilitate
by
specialist
therapy
personnel
.
nobody
be
try
to
remove
clinical
support
from
child
.
we
need
to
bolster
they
,
not
reduce
they
.
the
family
-
cent
model
be
a
complementary
approach
to
provide
therapeutic
support
,
rather
than
a
alternative
approach
,
which
have
be
suggest
in
some
quarter
.
I
be
glad
that
the
minister
have
at
least
clarify
that
,
but
it
leave
a
question
over
the
constitution
of
the
child
's
disability
network
team
.
I
note
the
presence
of
the
senior
minister
and
I
be
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
address
he
directly
.
where
the
team
have
be
create
,
there
be
acknowledgement
that
this
be
not
a
perfect
model
.
some
work
be
ongoing
internally
on
how
that
team
will
be
roll
out
.
I
can
understand
a
proposal
to
bring
family
into
the
therapeutic
process
.
however
,
the
evidence
show
that
there
be
still
a
massive
waiting
list
not
only
for
assessment
of
need
but
also
for
psychological
service
.
I
be
not
talk
about
CAMHS
;
I
make
a
distinction
between
access
to
child
and
adult
mental
health
service
.
there
be
9554
child
wait
for
psychological
service
at
the
moment
;
14619
wait
for
occupational
therapy
;
8,666
wait
for
physiotherapy
;
33106
wait
for
some
form
of
speech
and
language
intervention
or
assessment
;
5590
wait
for
access
to
dietetic
sister
;
16,838
wait
for
ophthalmology
service
;
and
8,457
wait
for
audiology
service
.
I
do
not
want
to
become
excessively
rhetorical
about
this
because
we
be
talk
about
child
here
.
I
be
try
to
understand
how
the
cDNT
will
evolve
.
the
challenge
therein
have
be
well
articulate
.
Parent
and
public
representative
have
push
back
on
the
HSE
on
that
issue
.
the
government
or
the
HSE
do
not
buttress
that
team
with
the
resource
to
allow
for
the
follow
-
on
service
such
as
I
have
mention
.
it
be
not
just
about
the
AON
.
the
assessment
be
a
vital
element
to
get
the
child
in
the
door
but
they
then
need
the
follow
-
on
service
.
I
have
be
around
this
house
for
a
reasonably
long
period
.
I
be
confused
over
how
the
supply
of
professional
who
will
deliver
this
service
will
match
the
demand
.
I
still
cannot
see
how
the
government
will
do
that
.
we
have
not
see
a
articulation
of
that
yet
through
what
be
suppose
to
be
the
child
disability
network
team
.
I
take
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
in
good
faith
,
as
we
all
do
.
we
all
welcome
when
she
push
back
on
the
HSE
in
the
recent
past
in
respect
of
the
cDNT
.
however
,
once
a
child
get
through
the
AON
,
how
do
the
follow
-
up
service
such
as
psychology
,
occupational
therapy
,
physiotherapy
and
all
have
the
other
service
wrap
themselves
around
the
same
child
with
that
need
?
that
be
the
missing
piece
of
the
jigsaw
.
I
could
give
the
minister
chapter
and
verse
about
the
HSE
's
apparent
lack
of
internalisation
as
a
institution
culturally
of
its
need
to
be
transparent
about
how
it
spend
resource
.
the
HSE
do
not
seem
to
have
internalise
that
obligation
it
have
.
we
see
evidence
of
that
at
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
in
recent
week
where
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
highlight
the
lack
of
transparency
-
my
word
-
in
respect
of
how
budget
line
be
spend
right
down
to
provision
of
the
service
we
be
discuss
.
I
do
not
want
to
make
political
hay
out
of
this
issue
.
all
I
want
be
for
the
child
in
my
constituency
who
require
the
service
to
be
able
to
get
the
service
,
as
we
all
want
in
all
we
constituency
.
somebody
need
to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
bridge
that
gap
without
trot
out
the
same
line
,
day
in
day
out
about
recruitment
issue
.
for
people
live
in
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
region
,
CHO
2
cover
Galway
,
Mayo
and
Roscommon
,
only
two
child
be
wait
more
than
two
month
or
three
month
.
however
,
in
my
area
,
CHO
4
,
cover
County
Kerry
,
Cork
north
,
Cork
north
Lee
,
Cork
south
Lee
and
Cork
west
,
it
be
500
child
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
be
aware
of
this
.
in
some
place
,
the
system
can
be
make
to
work
to
deploy
the
resource
across
geographical
location
and
county
boundary
if
need
be
or
across
the
CHO
area
so
that
they
follow
the
child
where
there
be
spare
capacity
in
one
part
of
the
system
.
that
be
what
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
call
for
;
that
be
what
we
have
all
be
call
for
,
include
Fianna
Fáil
Deputy
.
if
that
can
be
make
to
work
,
that
would
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
I
do
not
doubt
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
in
seek
to
push
the
HSE
along
.
have
be
in
government
,
I
know
what
it
be
like
to
sit
at
that
side
of
the
table
and
I
know
what
it
be
like
to
be
hold
accountable
for
my
action
.
the
same
apply
to
we
all
if
we
be
line
minister
.
Sinn
Féin
Member
will
also
be
accountable
when
they
be
in
government
.
I
look
forward
to
that
time
.
we
all
be
accountable
ultimately
as
the
maker
of
policy
.
we
cannot
keep
hive
it
off
to
the
HSE
.
at
some
point
there
must
be
political
accountability
for
this
decision
as
they
affect
we
fellow
citizen
and
child
.
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
to
redouble
he
effort
to
bridge
the
gap
so
that
we
as
a
nation
do
not
have
16,838
child
wait
for
follow
on
ophthalmology
service
and
14619
wait
for
occupational
therapy
.
all
of
this
figure
come
from
the
HSE
's
reply
to
parliamentary
question
.
in
fairness
to
the
HSE
,
it
be
extremely
good
at
answer
parliamentary
question
.
it
will
provide
chapter
and
verse
,
line
by
line
of
all
the
detail
.
the
additional
layer
that
I
would
see
be
put
on
top
of
that
and
I
think
we
will
all
start
ask
this
question
fairly
quickly
be
:
where
be
the
expenditure
to
match
the
need
?
ultimately
,
that
be
what
this
motion
be
about
.
I
support
the
motion
and
I
be
glad
it
have
be
bring
before
we
.
collectively
,
we
have
all
be
talk
about
this
issue
.
I
would
like
to
take
the
heat
out
of
it
and
let
in
some
light
if
we
can
.
I
know
the
minister
will
want
to
achieve
much
along
with
he
ministerial
colleague
to
address
this
issue
because
the
law
now
demand
it
.
there
be
a
corpus
of
law
and
the
high
court
have
adjudicate
on
it
.
I
be
glad
to
see
the
shift
in
respect
of
what
be
a
extremely
flawed
model
relate
to
the
cDNT
.
how
will
the
minister
underpin
and
buttress
that
team
across
the
country
so
that
we
can
have
that
kind
of
complementarity
between
family
and
therapist
to
deliver
for
the
child
?
I
thank
the
Deputy
.
I
accept
that
clarity
as
quickly
as
possible
be
important
.
farmer
be
make
decision
about
the
situation
in
which
they
find
themselves
.
every
pig
that
leave
a
farm
at
the
moment
be
lose
the
farmer
a
significant
amount
of
money
,
and
that
be
increase
by
the
day
.
I
be
very
much
aware
of
the
situation
and
have
be
liais
very
closely
with
the
sector
for
a
significant
period
of
time
.
the
€
7
billion
scheme
announce
three
or
four
week
ago
just
before
the
war
in
Ukraine
equate
to
€
20000
per
farmer
.
the
ongoing
travesty
in
Ukraine
have
have
significant
implication
for
all
sector
,
in
particular
the
agrifood
sector
,
of
which
the
pig
sector
be
undoubtedly
the
part
most
affect
.
I
will
meet
the
IFA
and
farmer
late
today
let
we
be
clear
.
the
ask
from
the
IFA
of
the
government
be
massive
,
namely
€
100
million
up
front
.
in
term
of
the
€
7
million
scheme
I
launch
,
the
350
commercial
pig
unit
concerned
would
seem
to
translate
into
240
individual
undertaking
,
and
€
100
million
would
equate
to
€
420000
per
undertaking
.
if
€50
million
be
cover
by
the
State
and
€
50
million
by
levy
,
that
would
amount
to
€
210000
in
state
contribution
,
with
€
210000
to
be
pay
back
under
the
proposal
in
a
levy
over
ten
year
or
so
.
that
be
the
nature
of
the
ask
,
and
it
be
massive
.
I
be
very
much
aware
of
the
pressure
on
the
sector
.
the
deputy
be
correct
.
it
be
a
sustainable
and
valuable
industry
,
the
third
large
within
we
agrifood
sector
.
we
want
to
ensure
it
be
there
for
the
future
.
I
be
very
much
aware
of
how
acute
the
bottom
of
the
hole
sector
find
itself
in
be
at
the
moment
.
I
will
work
and
engage
with
farmer
on
how
I
can
work
with
they
to
support
the
sector
through
this
.
I
again
thank
Deputy
O'
Sullivan
and
Carthy
and
the
many
other
Deputy
who
raise
this
issue
with
I
in
recent
day
.
be
the
minister
of
State
aware
of
the
issue
that
be
affect
the
quality
of
ash
for
maker
of
hurley
?
be
she
aware
the
game
of
hurl
have
UNESCO
intangible
heritage
status
?
I
want
to
ensure
a
process
be
put
in
place
to
support
the
game
of
hurl
on
the
basis
that
Canning
Hurleys
have
announce
it
be
close
today
.
it
be
a
major
hammer
blow
to
the
game
of
hurl
in
this
country
and
I
seek
the
government
's
response
to
that
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
as
I
state
at
the
outset
,
the
game
of
hurl
be
embed
in
the
Irish
psyche
and
it
have
UNESCO
intangible
heritage
status
.
when
a
family
company
like
Canning
Hurleys
announce
last
week
it
be
close
today
,
that
be
a
hammer
blow
to
everybody
who
love
the
game
of
hurl
,
no
matter
what
part
of
the
country
they
be
in
,
because
the
Canning
family
be
synonymous
with
the
game
.
will
the
Minister
of
State
convene
a
meeting
with
Croke
Park
,
Teagasc
,
Coillte
and
the
Irish
Guild
of
Ash
Hurley
Makers
as
soon
as
possible
?
I
note
that
meeting
have
take
place
several
time
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
say
.
however
,
would
she
consider
reconvenen
a
meeting
at
the
early
possible
opportunity
as
a
matter
of
urgency
to
deal
with
supply
issue
?
one
of
the
supply
line
come
from
Ukraine
and
that
make
the
issue
particularly
urgent
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
willingness
to
do
that
.
will
she
inform
the
House
when
she
propose
to
write
to
they
and
set
up
that
meeting
because
we
cannot
afford
to
lose
hurley
-
maker
?
they
be
the
supply
line
,
bloodline
and
bloodstock
of
that
sport
.
will
the
Minister
of
State
place
a
degree
of
urgency
on
this
issue
?
it
would
be
wonderful
if
we
be
to
hear
from
she
that
she
be
conven
,
as
a
matter
of
urgency
,
a
meeting
of
all
the
stakeholder
as
early
as
next
week
or
the
week
after
,
for
instance
,
such
be
the
urgency
of
this
issue
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
call
they
all
together
,
they
will
come
.
she
should
not
worry
as
she
have
that
power
.
hence
the
urgency
.

I
have
just
receive
notification
this
very
minute
that
a
company
,
Positive
Care
,
which
provide
residential
service
for
young
people
,
be
to
be
put
out
of
business
with
the
loss
of
up
to
240
job
.
the
company
provide
residential
service
for
vulnerable
young
people
in
up
to
25
facility
,
as
I
understand
it
.
I
appreciate
that
I
be
inquire
with
the
Taoiseach
about
this
matter
at
very
short
notice
,
but
I
ask
he
to
make
himself
aware
of
what
be
happen
.
it
be
very
serious
for
the
provision
of
service
for
young
,
vulnerable
people
,
especially
that
who
be
in
residential
care
.
the
loss
of
this
service
provider
represent
a
massive
blow
to
the
capability
of
this
country
to
provide
for
the
most
vulnerable
of
we
young
people
.
I
want
to
be
clear
that
the
school
building
programme
continue
apace
.
it
be
to
the
credit
of
all
involved
that
even
during
lockdown
,
we
manage
to
continue
to
do
the
work
that
need
to
be
do
.
there
be
no
question
of
the
school
building
programme
not
progress
as
it
should
,
and
rightly
so
.
the
primary
issue
raise
by
the
deputy
related
to
accommodation
be
make
for
Ukrainian
student
.
I
reiterate
to
the
House
the
commitment
of
the
government
to
welcoming
people
flee
the
war
in
Ukraine
and
seek
protection
here
in
Ireland
.
I
appreciate
that
be
also
the
view
of
the
deputy
,
as
it
be
the
share
view
of
this
House
.
the
Department
's
primary
concern
be
to
ensure
that
child
and
young
people
of
schoolgoing
age
from
Ukraine
be
provide
with
appropriate
educational
opportunity
in
the
come
period
.
I
thank

there

the

they

future
.
in
conclusion
,
since
last
November
the
Labour
Party
have
advocate
a
reduction
in
the
vat
rate
on
electricity
and
gas
supplies
,
which
be
currently
13.5
%
.
in
January
we
tab
a
motion
in
the
House
explicitly
call
on
the
government
to
seek
a
derogation
from
the
EU
that
would
allow
we
to
reduce
this
vat
rate
and
restore
it
back
to
that
pre-crisis
level
.
we
again
call
on
the
government
to
secure
that
derogation
to
help
tackle
the
cost
of
living
crisis
.
I
support
the
motion
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
question
no.
688
,
which
I
tab
on
5
April
to
the
Minister
for
Health
,
in
which
I
ask
he
if
he
would
report
on
the
housing
for
all
plan
for
a
amend
fair
deal
scheme
to
remove
disincentive
for
sale
and
rental
of
vacant
property
.
the
question
be
answer
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Butler
.
it
state
:
my
Department
be
actively
collaborate
with
the
Department
of
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
and
other
Department
in
the
development
of
a
mechanism
in
relation
to
the
rental
of
vacant
property
"
in
a
way
that
be
target
,
equitable
,
evidence
-
base
and
provide
appropriate
safeguard
for
vulnerable
old
people
"
,
as
commit
to
in
housing
for
all
action
19.8
.
complex
policy
question
be
currently
be
resolve
in
order
to
meet
this
criterion
and
mitigate
the
high
risk
and
cost
associate
with
unintended
consequence
,
with
a
view
to
introduce
legislation
as
soon
as
possible
once
this
be
complete
.
I
expect
to
be
in
a
position
to
bring
legislation
forward
in
the
come
month
.
when
we
receive
this
reply
,
we
try
to
dig
into
the
language
of
what
they
mean
.
I
take
some
solace
that
where
the
minister
state
,
"
I
expect
to
be
in
a
position
to
bring
legislation
forward
in
the
come
month
"
,
she
mean
what
she
say
in
that
regard
.
there
be
a
legitimate
expectation
on
the
part
of
member
and
the
public
that
this
legislation
would
be
promulgate
as
soon
as
possible
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
be
so
many
house
out
there
that
be
vacant
as
a
result
of
people
be
in
nursing
home
or
participant
on
a
elder
care
scheme
or
the
nursing
home
support
scheme
.
I
ask
that
some
urgency
be
give
to
that
legislation
.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Noonan
,
in
respond
to
the
motion
might
give
we
some
sense
of
a
timeline
for
when
that
legislation
might
be
bring
before
we
.
the
language
use
in
reply
to
parliamentary
question
be
sometimes
quite
dense
.
as
outline
above
,
the
reply
state
,
"
complex
policy
question
be
currently
be
resolve
in
order
to
meet
this
criterion
and
mitigate
the
high
risk
and
cost
associate
with
unintended
consequence
...
"
.
I
have
a
sense
of
what
that
might
mean
,
but
I
would
prefer
clarity
on
what
exactly
it
mean
and
on
the
stumbling
block
to
that
happen
.
if
that
hurdle
be
jump
and
the
legislation
be
bring
before
we
,
it
would
create
a
supply
line
of
house
for
many
people
.
that
seem
to
be
low
-
hang
fruit
.
within
we
constituency
,
we
all
see
the
evidence
of
vacant
home
as
a
result
of
people
be
in
nursing
home
through
the
nursing
home
support
scheme
.
if
government
could
do
that
one
thing
as
a
early
win
,
perhaps
before
the
end
of
this
year
,
it
would
release
a
lot
of
house
for
people
to
live
in
.
ultimately
,
the
motion
be
about
get
people
into
house
.
I
agree
with
the
spirit
of
the
motion
and
the
request
for
urgency
.
if
the
sense
of
urgency
that
we
apply
to
the
Covid
response
,
where
we
act
collaboratively
,
be
apply
to
the
get
the
supply
of
housing
in
this
country
sort
,
the
government
would
find
itself
push
a
open
door
.
it
would
take
a
lot
of
the
political
heat
and
rhetoric
out
of
the
issue
.
it
would
also
take
a
lot
of
the
personality
and
the
ego
out
of
it
.
in
term
of
some
of
the
ego
that
have
inform
this
debate
,
it
be
a
little
bit
unedifying
,
especially
when
we
be
try
to
provide
housing
for
people
who
genuinely
need
it
.
if
that
same
sense
of
urgency
be
apply
to
this
issue
,
the
government
would
be
push
a
open
door
with
many
deputy
across
the
House
.
if
appropriate
,
I
would
like
a
specific
response
to
the
query
that
I
have
raise
in
respect
of
the
nursing
home
scenario
because
that
have
come
up
time
and
again
in
this
motion
.
if
be
a
overarching
theme
of
this
motion
.
if
we
could
get
a
real
response
to
that
,
we
would
be
very
grateful
.
as
of
November
2020
,
there
be
61880
household
on
the
social
housing
waiting
list
.
that
be
the
late
figure
we
have
,
but
there
may
be
update
figure
.
the
Minister
of
State
and
I
know
that
much
of
we
work
in
constituency
be
around
advocate
for
people
to
access
local
authority
housing
.
there
be
unintended
consequence
of
be
on
a
list
for
that
in
private
rent
accommodation
.
more
people
be
come
to
we
state
that
they
rental
agreement
be
come
to
a
end
or
that
they
landlord
be
sell
the
property
.
many
accidental
landlord
be
get
out
of
the
market
and
that
be
have
a
untold
knock
-
on
effect
.
it
be
not
just
about
a
lack
of
housing
supply
;
it
be
the
other
stressor
that
create
within
family
as
a
result
of
not
have
the
security
or
fixity
of
tenure
that
be
so
often
a
staple
of
political
discourse
in
this
country
long
before
even
this
House
be
establish
.
the
idea
of
fixity
of
rent
and
fixity
of
tenure
,
security
and
a
roof
over
one
's
head
be
fundamental
principle
embed
in
the
Irish
psyche
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
negative
.
I
be
try
to
be
proactive
and
progressive
in
seek
to
support
the
government
when
the
government
be
worthy
of
support
.
I
sense
from
the
answer
I
receive
to
my
question
on
the
nursing
home
support
scheme
and
the
already
state
policy
of
seek
to
let
into
the
market
that
house
or
to
provide
a
supply
of
house
,
be
that
urgency
be
not
there
and
there
be
too
many
technocratic
and
bureaucratic
impediment
in
the
way
of
do
that
.
I
hope
that
hurdle
can
be
jump
so
that
we
can
release
this
supply
of
house
.
there
need
to
be
great
urgency
.
every
deputy
and
senator
across
the
political
divide
be
solution
-
drive
and
want
to
see
that
supply
.
we
will
do
everything
we
can
within
we
constituency
to
facilitate
that
supply
.
however
,
there
need
to
be
a
top
-
down
approach
.
arguably
,
the
policy
be
move
too
slowly
.
I
say
that
respectfully
.
Fine
Gael
have
be
in
government
for
quite
a
long
time
.
the
government
of
which
the
Labour
Party
be
a
part
between
2011
and
2016
do
not
have
money
to
build
house
.
we
have
to
make
stark
choice
.
at
the
latter
end
of
2015
and
in
2016
,
we
make
money
available
for
house
building
but
we
have
not
see
the
throughput
of
supply
since
2016
.
it
be
high
time
we
build
more
house
in
this
country
and
sort
out
this
problem
.
the
money
be
there
,
as
be
the
willingness
and
impetus
to
do
the
work
.
we
need
to
see
great
government
action

there

do
the
Minister
for
Finance
intend
to
introduce
a
windfall
tax
on
the
extraordinary
profit
of
energy
company
to
fund
measure
to
combat
the
rise
cost
of
energy
for
household
and
enterprise
?
early
this
month
the
minister
indicate
that
he
be
finally
,
as
it
be
put
,
evaluate
the
potential
of
slap
energy
supplier
with
windfall
tax
bill
.
I
want
to
know
if
that
will
come
to
fruition
.
I
welcome
the
fact
the
government
have
finally
come
around
at
least
to
evaluate
,
to
use
the
minister
's
word
,
a
windfall
tax
on
extraordinary
profit
.
this
be
a
proposal
the
government
vote
against
in
January
when
the
Labour
Party
include
it
as
part
of
we
cost
-
of
-
living
motion
.
we
know
energy
company
like
the
ESB
,
which
be
not
immediately
tie
into
rise
price
,
make
€679
million
in
profit
last
year
,
as
thousand
of
homeowner
struggle
to
pay
soar
energy
bill
.
next
week
,
ESB
's
electric
Ireland
will
go
ahead
with
a
near
25
%
increase
in
electricity
and
gas
price
.
we
know
that
a
conservative
estimate
,
base
on
2020
figure
,
suggest
this
could
raise
to
the
tune
of
€
60
million
to
help
pay
for
cost
-
of
-
living
support
for
household
.
will
the
minister
of
State
give
we
a
clear
indication
as
to
the
timeline
for
the
completion
of
the
evaluation
?
that
will
not
cut
the
mustard
with
the
business
and
household
I
deal
with
in
my
constituency
.
the
Spanish
government
be
able
to
do
this
.
it
introduce
a
windfall
tax
on
energy
company
last
September
,
therefore
,
there
be
a
precedent
set
in
the
European
Union
on
this
.
I
want
to
give
some
solace
to
the
small
business
and
householder
in
my
constituency
.
the
Spanish
case
be
a
clear
example
of
how
fund
generate
through
the
windfall
tax
be
pay
for
the
country
's
vat
energy
tax
cut
introduce
in
the
same
month
last
year
.
there
be
proof
of
concept
and
this
tax
be
work
in
another
EU
member
state
.
I
ask
that
great
urgency
be
give
to
this
concept
,
thereby
bring
to
fruition
a
windfall
tax
on
profit
.

be
I
in

amendment
?
thank
you
very
much
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
.
we
welcome
the
motion
.
to
be
fair
,
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
minister
be
do
he
good
.
it
would
be
good
if
we
could
take
some
of
the
heat
out
of
this
debate
because
it
have
become
quite
personalised
of
late
.
I
know
we
all
have
to
robustly
defend
we
position
in
this
House
.
that
be
right
and
proper
.
however
,
the
personalised
nature
of
the
debate
do
not
give
comfort
to
the
people
who
be
on
the
housing
list
in
my
constituency
.
if
I
be
to
characterise
they
experience
at
present
,
it
be
such
that
,
historically
,
if
you
be
on
a
housing
list
you
be
apply
for
a
house
from
a
rent
house
or
a
family
home
and
you
have
a
guarantee
of
a
roof
over
you
head
.
increasingly
,
however
,
we
,
as
public
representative
,
be
see
more
and
more
people
come
to
we
in
desperation
because
they
be
be
force
out
of
accommodation
through
a
notice
to
quit
and
they
have
absolutely
no
place
to
go
due
to
the
lack
of
supply
.
that
be
acknowledge
.
I
do
not
want
to
politicise
this
debate
.
I
acknowledge
the
fact
that
the
government
be
seek
to
do
what
it
can
through
the
housing
for
all
policy
.
one
of
my
worry
be
as
follow
.
let
we
take
a
town
like
Mitchelstown
in
County
Cork
.
it
be
a
typical
rural
town
that
have
a
agricultural
hinterland
.
there
be
a
phenomenal
demand
for
housing
in
Mitchelstown
and
there
be
also
a
capacity
to
build
house
.
in
spite
of
the
pent
-
up
demand
that
exist
,
however
,
there
be
a
major
issue
in
term
of
the
ability
to
provide
essential
service
such
as
water
and
waste
water
treatment
facility
.
for
a
couple
of
year
,
my
constituency
colleague
and
I
have
all
advocate
for
a
increase
in
capacity
for
water
and
waste
water
service
because
,
as
we
speak
,
we
cannot
build
house
in
the
town
of
Mitchelstown
because
Irish
Water
will
tell
the
local
authority
that
the
capacity
be
not
there
.
it
be
all
well
and
good
for
we
to
talk
about
the
supply
that
be
come
on
stream
now
.
land
be
be
zone
in
county
development
plan
and
we
be
see
,
theoretically
,
wonderful
opportunity
emerge
on
the
horizon
,
but
the
pinch
point
be
the
fact
that
if
we
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
deliver
basic
infrastructure
,
such
as
be
the
case
in
Mitchelstown
,
then
the
policy
fail
.
until
such
time
as
the
nettle
be
grasp
on
that
issue
,
I
suspect
that
town
like
Mitchelstown
and
my
native
town
of
Mallow
,
where
there
be
a
strategic
housing
development
application
for
299
residential
unit
before
a
Bord
Pleanála
with
a
decision
date
due
for
23
May
,
will
fail
to
provide
sufficient
housing
.
in
the
event
that
the
planning
permission
be
grant
,
I
guarantee
that
Irish
Water
and
the
local
authority
will
turn
around
and
say
that
the
planning
may
have
be
receive
but
the
commencement
will
not
be
give
until
such
time
as
there
be
capacity
to
deal
with
water
and
infrastructure
.
if
that
issue
be
deal
with
as
a
top
priority
the
minister
could
pick
off
a
lot
of
low
-
hang
fruit
.
he
know
that
anyway
.
I
know
for
a
fact
that
he
be
very
much
aware
of
the
infrastructural
issue
relate
to
Mitchelstown
in
particular
.
I
understand
that
he
might
visit
the
town
in
the
not
-
too
-
distant
future
.
I
ask
he
to
use
he
good
office
to
lean
in
to
Irish
Water
.
if
some
capacity
be
deliver
in
Mitchelstown
,
it
would
have
a
tremendous
effect
,
as
it
would
throughout
the
country
.
we
support
the
motion
put
forward
by
Sinn
Féin
.
in
the
few
short
minute
remain
,
I
would
like
to
speak
about
the
tenant
in
situ
scheme
advocate
by
the
Labour
Party
.
I
urge
that
we
lift
the
cap
on
the
ability
of
local
authority
to
purchase
when
there
be
a
hap
or
ras
-
some
people
be
still
on
the
latter
scheme
-
support
tenant
in
situ
.
the
limit
on
local
authority
's
buy
second
-
hand
home
and
compete
with
first
-
time
buyer
be
have
consequence
whereby
people
who
be
get
social
housing
support
through
hap
be
then
be
evict
by
small
landlord
who
be
leave
the
housing
market
.
that
have
be
well
signal
to
the
minister
.
because
of
this
limit
,
there
be
a
unintended
consequence
of
force
people
who
require
social
housing
support
into
homelessness
.
that
be
what
I
speak
about
at
the
top
of
my
intervention
here
tonight
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
look
at
great
flexibility
around
a
tenant
in
situ
scheme
and
to
allow
local
authority
to
purchase
housing
where
there
be
a
tenant
in
situ
get
social
housing
support
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
will
have
a
answer
to
that
.
I
would
welcome
a
reply
.
if
he
be
favourable
to
that
,
it
would
be
good
.
the
other
point
I
wish
to
raise
relate
to
the
Croí
Cónaithe
scheme
.
if
the
minister
be
respond
to
the
debate
-----
I
thank
the
minister
.
I
want
to
put
it
on
the
record
that
I
ask
he
about
this
scheme
on
5
April
and
I
receive
a
reply
from
he
today
.
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
if
he
will
report
on
a
new
Croí
Cónaithe
fund
under
Housing
for
all
to
increase
owner
-
occupier
apartment
development
in
city
centre
.
I
know
it
be
a
city
-
focus
scheme
.
in
he
reply
,
the
minister
state
he
Department
be
currently
work
with
the
Housing
Agency
on
finalise
the
operational
basis
for
the
new
fund
and
it
expect
to
engage
with
prospective
proposer
in
the
call
for
proposal
in
the
second
quarter
of
2022
.
if
the
minister
or
he
official
be
listen
,
I
would
be
pleased
if
I
could
get
great
clarity
as
to
when
that
be
happen
because
it
would
facilitate
a
lot
of
accommodation
opportunity
over
the
shop
or
commercial
premise
to
turn
they
into
residential
space
.
what
be
not
know
out
there
be
the
number
of
scheme
that
be
available
for
town
.
the
big
impediment
to
somebody
in
a
town
or
city
convert
what
be
a
commercial
premise
into
a
residential
premise
,
where
there
be
perhaps
intergenerational
owner
,
be
that
they
be
not
go
to
make
the
leap
towards
convert
to
residential
with
all
of
the
attendant
grant
that
be
available
because
the
capital
cost
of
do
so
be
still
too
high
.
they
may
be
asset
rich
but
cash
poor
and
they
be
at
pain
to
take
the
risk
of
borrowing
.
there
be
hundred
of
town
throughout
the
country
where
we
have
lose
capacity
on
the
main
street
,
where
shop
and
commercial
premise
have
close
.
there
be
many
people
who
would
like
to
live
in
town
,
people
who
be
downsizing
and
want
to
be
close
to
service
on
the
main
street
,
which
would
free
up
many
house
.
yet
,
people
do
not
perceive
that
there
be
anything
in
place
for
they
to
be
able
to
do
that
.
we
need
more
scheme
that
be
fasttrack
.
there
should
be
a
treatment
in
planning
that
could
facilitate
that
and
that
could
allow
for
good
funding
of
it
.
on
the
Labour
Party
's
residential
Tenancy
(
Tenant
's
rights
)
Bill
2021
,
there
remain
a
huge
imbalance
in
power
between
renter
and
landlord
.
we
Bill
focus
on
issue
relate
to
quality
of
rental
accommodation
.
we
need
to
get
solid
commitment
when
it
come
to
security
of
tenure
.
that
be
ultimately
the
bedrock
upon
which
renter
's
rights
be
base
.
I
will
return
to
the
issue
on
which
I
speak
in
relation
to
Mitchelstown
and
Mallow
,
for
instance
.
this
be
two
example
of
two
typical
town
.
the
capacity
constraint
and
the
infrastructural
constraint
will
require
that
more
people
will
be
in
rent
accommodation
for
long
.
that
market
trend
for
rent
be
go
upwards
.
the
housing
assistance
payment
,
HAP
,
be
not
meet
pace
with
demand
.
there
need
to
be
a
rights
-
base
approach
for
tenant
for
the
duration
of
this
housing
crisis
.
that
be
what
we
advocate
for
in
that
Bill
.
I
ask
that
that
Bill
would
be
look
at
again
.
I
thank
deputy
Buckley
for
again
raise
this
issue
on
behalf
of
the
community
.
it
be
a
very
frustrating
thing
,
especially
on
Christmas
Day
,
when
you
run
into
trouble
or
you
be
be
advise

a
boil
water
notice

I
think
of
the
four
topical
issue
matter
tonight
,
deputy
Buckley
be
definitely
in

he
have
a

will
be

at
June
,

I
have
in

,
the

I
welcome
the
publication
of
this
Bill
in
the
name
of
deputy
Bacik
.
I
congratulate
my
colleague
for
bring
forward
this
Bill
and
that
who
work
on
it
within
we
team
on
the
Labour
bench
.
it
be
worth
reiterate
what
the
Bill
set
out
to
do
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
Minister
of
State
say
the
government
be
not
oppose
it
at
second
Stage
.
in
Ireland
,
approximately
380000
worker
earn
less
than
the
officially
accept
threshold
of
low
pay
,
which
be
two
third
of
median
income
.
this
be
one
of
the
high
proportion
of
worker
on
low
pay
,
approximately
one
fifth
,
in
the
European
Union
or
OECD
.
woman
be
more
likely
than
man
to
be
in
a
low
pay
job
.
in
June
2000
,
when
the
first
national
minimum
wage
rate
be
declare
,
it
be
set
at
a
level
slightly
high
than
two
third
of
the
median
average
income
.
follow
the
recommendation
of
the
national
minimum
wage
commission
publish
in
April
1998
,
the
initial
rate
be
€
4.40
,
which
be
approximately
73
%
of
the
median
hourly
earnings
of
€
6
.
follow
the
initial
rate
,
however
,
the
national
minimum
wage
,
or
NMW
as
we
call
it
,
have
fail
to
keep
up
with
rise
in

,
fall
to
close
to
40
%
of

earnings
.
as
the
Minister
of
State
say
,
the
programme
for
government
have
commit
to
progress
from
the
current
national
minimum
wage
to
a
living
wage
.
it
be
important
for
we
to
explain
for
people
who
be
listen
to
and
watch
this
debate
that
there
be
a
significant
difference
between
the
minimum
wage
and
a
living
wage
.
that
have
be
well
articulate
by
we
colleague
.
we
want
progress
on
this
.
we
be
now
two
year
into
this
government
.
the
low
pay
Commission
have
furnish
its
report
to
the
minister
and
we
would
like
great
urgency
with
regard
to
its
publication
.
whatever
recommendation
be
in
that
report
would
give
life
to
that
living
wage
that
we
be
all
advocate
for
.
unlike
the
national
minimum
wage
,
which
be
not
base
on
the
cost
of
living
,
a
living
wage
can
be
define
as
the
rate
of
pay
that
would
enable
full
-
time
employ
adult
across
the
State
to
afford
a
minimum
socially
acceptable
standard
of
living
.
it
provide
for
need
,
not
want
.
it
be
evidence
-
base
and
ground
in
social
consensus
.
that
be
the
purpose
of
this
Bill
.
it
be
worth
articulate
the
view
of
that
who
be
under
severe
pressure
at
the
moment
,
that
be
,
low
-
pay
worker
throughout
Irish
society
,
people
like
Linda
,
a
young
work
parent
in
Cork
,
who
contact
we
to
say
:
a
pay
increase
would
mean
that
I
would
be
able
to
afford
the
necessary
maintenance
my
house
be
in
desperate
need
of
.
at
the
moment
with
childcare
be
so
expensive
I
do
not
know
if
I
can
keep
my
job
.
my
husband
's
job
be
a
low
pay
job
and
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
it
feel
like
I
be
damned
if
I
do
and
damned
if
I
do
not
.
it
be
precisely
people
like
Linda
we
be
speak
for
here
.
they
be
now
in
a
position
where
they
do
not
even
know
if
they
can
maintain
themselves
in
full
-
time
employment
.
there
be
a
cost
to
they
in
keep
they
job
.
that
be
the
irony
and
tragedy
of
the
situation
.
it
may
,
ironically
,
be
more
beneficial
for
somebody
like
Linda
to
move
to
a
situation
where
the
family
be
entirely
dependent
on
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
it
be
for
that
people
that
we
speak
.
I
think
the
Minister
of
State
be
sympathetic
to
that
,
to
be
fair
to
he
.
he
have
say
he
be
not
go
to
oppose
the
Bill
.
this
be
a
issue
on
which
all
of
we
in
this
House
can
unite
.
if
we
can
all
work
together
to
bring
about
this
living
wage
and
have
a
meaningful
impact
for
people
like
Linda
and
thousand
of
other
like
she
,
we
will
have
do
a
good
day
's
work
.
I
welcome
this
legislation
.
it
be
no
easy
task
to
transpose
EU
directive
.
I
applaud
the
effort
of
the
Minister
of
State
and
he
official
in
this
regard
and
in
present
this
Bill
.
starting
with
the
issue
of
domain
name
,
specifically
.ie
domain
name
,
there
be
309953
such
.ie
domain
.
only
278042
of
that
be
base
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
,
while
4532
be
base
in
Northern
Ireland
.
the
kernel
of
my
point
be
that
this
leave
31,911
of
that
.ie
website
operate
from
outside
the
island
of
Ireland
.
where
do
consumer
stand
when
they
procure
a
product
or
service
from
a
domain
register
in
Ireland
but
whose
activity
be
offshore
,
perhaps
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
or
elsewhere
globally
,
whether
in
the
EU
or
in
a
third
country
?
if
such
a
company
be
base
in
the
UK
,
where
do
consumer
stand
regard
they
rights
in
the
context
of
the
transposition
of
this
directive
into
Irish
law
?
if
consumer
purchase
goods
and
service
from
company
in
the
UK
,
via
a
.ie
domain
or
another
such
domain
,
where
stand
they
rights
?
despite
Brexit
,
people
in
Ireland
be
still
consume
a
significant
number
of
goods
purchase
online
from
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
we
do
not
know
if
this
legislation
be
silent
or
active
on
the
dynamic
of
protect
the
rights
of
consumer
in
this
context
.
Consumer
be
protect
in
a
EU
context
because
this
be
a
EU
directive
be
transpose
.
if
some
clarity
could
be
provide
on
this
point
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
.
I
raise
this
matter
because
we
be
increasingly
come
across
instance
of
fraud
where
people
who
have
log
onto
a
.ie
domain
to
procure
goods
or
service
find
they
money
have
go
into
the
ether
,
the
service
or
goods
do
not
arrive
and
there
be
no
recourse
whatsoever
for
that
consumer
.
this
trend
be
on
a
upward
trajectory
.
that
be
the
first
issue
I
wish
to
raise
regard
this
legislation
.
I
turn
to
the
issue
of
internet
service
provider
,
isp
,
specifically
section
2
of
the
Bill
,
where
there
be
a
interpretation
of
a
"
electronic
communication
service
"
.
this
be
define
as
"
a
service
normally
provide
for
remuneration
via
electronic
communication
network
,
which
encompass
,
with
the
exception
of
a
service
provide
,
or
exercising
editorial
control
over
,
content
transmit
use
electronic
communication
network
and
service
,
the
follow
type
of
service
"
.
this
service
be
then
set
out
in
section
2
(
a
)
.
they
include
"
a
publicly
available
electronic
communication
service
that
provide
a
internet
access
service
"
.
I
take
that
to
mean
that
if
a
company
be
a
internet
service
provider
,
and
offer
a
broadband
service
encompass
several
platform
,
such
as
wi-fi
,
television
service
and
other
similar
service
,
then
the
legislation
cover
such
a
service
,
as
I
understand
it
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
the
position
be
unclear
to
I
,
notwithstand
the
Minister
of
State
's
point
that
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
,
the
Central
Bank
and
ComReg
will
all
have
a
role
in
enforce
the
legislation
.
as
I
understand
it
,
under
the
Bill
a
consumer
be
give
a
general
right
to
withhold
any
outstanding
part
of
payment
to
the
trader
until
the
trader
's
obligation
be
fulfil
.
in
that
circumstance
,
the
price
withheld
by
the
consumer
should
be
proportionate
to
the
decrease
in
value
of
the
digital
content
or
supply
that
do
not
conform
with
the
contract
and
the
consumer
's
decision
to
withhold
payment
must
be
express
in
a
statement
to
the
trader
.
I
will
use
a
concrete
example
to
illustrate
the
outworking
of
that
.
let
we
say
I
sign
a
contract
with
a
isp
for
the
provision
of
my
broadband
on
a
residential
or
commercial
basis
and
that
service
be
subject
to
regular
outage
or
broadband
speed
be
less
than
adequate
,
for
instance
,
where
one
isp
be
offer
service
of
up
to
1
gb
but
the
service
provide
be
far
less
than
1
gb
and
no
good
than
4G
such
that
,
at
time
,
people
have
to
switch
over
to
4G
or
even
3g
because
the
service
be
so
bad
.
in
the
context
I
have
just
outline
,
what
recourse
do
the
consumer
have
?
if
the
consumer
advise
the
broadband
provider
that
he
or
she
have
call
its
helpline
on
numerous
occasion
and
be
not
get
the
service
for
which
,
for
example
,
he
or
she
be
pay
€
80
a
month
,
be
not
satisfied
with
the
service
and
be
now
withhold
the
follow
month
's
bill
until
such
time
as
the
isp
provide
he
or
she
with
the
service
it
have
contract
to
provide
,
what
mechanism
be
open
to
the
consumer
in
that
instance
?
as
it
stand
,
I
do
not
see
where
the
legislation
speak
to
that
very
dynamic
.
I
be
open
to
correction
on
this
,
but
from
my
perspective
and
in
term
of
a
consumer
protection
etho
,
there
do
not
seem
to
be
some
mechanism
build
into
the
legislation
that
allow
the
consumer
to
push
back
against
the
isp
without
the
isp
say
it
will
just
switch
off
the
service
.
there
need
to
be
some
mechanism
build
in
,
a
protection
for
the
consumer
,
to
allow
he
or
she
to
make
a
complaint
and
withhold
,
per
the
legislation
,
part
-
payment
or
a
proportionate
decrease
in
the
value
of
the
digital
content
that
be
be
provide
in
a
way
that
give
he
or
she
some
sort
of
assurance
and
confidence
that
he
or
she
can
do
so
without
be
penalise
or
the
service
cut
off
by
the
isp
.
if
the
legislation
can
speak
to
that
dynamic
in
very
explicit
term
,
it
will
send
a
clear
message
to
the
isp
that
there
be
redress
when
the
consumer
have
a
issue
.
the
reason
I
be
raise
this
issue
specifically
be
that
every
week
thousand
of
household
that
have
contract
with
isp
have
to
go
through
outage
and
blackout
or
be
switch
over
to
3g
and
4G
because
they
be
not
get
the
service
they
have
enter
into
a
contract
to
receive
and
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
recourse
for
they
.
will
this
legislation
protect
the
person
who
procure
the
service
of
a
isp
?
that
be
one
element
.
my
understanding
of
the
legislation
be
that
Irish
consumer
be
be
afford
a
robust
network
of
redress
option
as
part
of
they
newly
-
find
digital
rights
,
include
a
right
to
a
full
refund
,
exchange
or
repair
,
when
the
digital
content
or
digital
service
contract
be
not
as
describe
or
not
fit
for
the
purpose
intend
.
where
the
trader
be
liable
to
the
consumer
due
to
any
failure
to
supply
or
lack
of
conformity
of
the
digital
content
or
digital
service
with
the
digital
content
or
digital
service
contract
,
the
Bill
provide
that
a
consumer
may
pursue
remedy
against
the
person
liable
for
the
failure
or
lack
of
conformity
.
this
be
probably
a
nice
way
of
say
what
I
have
be
try
to
say
for
the
past
five
minute
.
it
be
concise
legal
language
that
have
be
offer
to
I
by
the
law
firm
,
Matheson
,
and
I
acknowledge
its
role
in
that
.
however
,
it
all
boil
down
to
the
kernel
of
the
point
that
I
be
make
,
namely
,
what
mechanism
do
the
consumer
have
,
without
place
a
undue
burden
where
the
proof
be
absolute
in
respect
of
the
lack
of
the
service
be
provide
?
we
cannot
have
a
situation
where
we
be
put
consumer
through
hoop
to
have
they
rights
vindicate
.
if
we
be
talk
about
consumer
have
to
go
to
the
CCPC
or
ComReg
on
a
issue
such
as
this
,
they
would
be
forgive
for
think
that
ComReg
might
not
have
the
capacity
to
deal
with
the
individual
case
if
there
be
hundred
,
or
possibly
thousand
,
of
that
come
in
its
door
every
week
.
can
some
mechanism
be
find
to
ensure
the
legislation
be
so
robust
that
there
be
no
way
that
the
isp
can
slip
off
the
hook
so
easily
?
what
I
be
advocate
be
that
if
a
consumer
decide
to
take
a
case
,
make
a
complaint
or
seek
redress
or
compensation
for
the
loss
of
service
,
they
should
not
face
a
onerous
burden
in
do
so
.
I
reiterate
the
point
in
regard
to
Brexit
.
where
stand
the
consumer
in
this
new
paradigm
in
which
,
post
Brexit
,
we
be
still
try
to
negotiate
we
relationship
with
the
Unite
Kingdom
in
regard
to
the
procurement
of
goods
and
service
?
where
goods
or
service
be
procure
from
the
UK
,
that
be
another
jurisdiction
and
obviously
not
subject
to
EU
law
.
be
there
a
mechanism
within
this
legislation
that
protect
the
rights
of
Irish
consumer
?
there
be
probably
hundred
of
thousand
of
online
transaction
at
a
residential
and
commercial
level
every
week
for
which
there
be
no
recourse
that
I
can
see
at
present
.
that
be
not
anybody
's
fault
.
it
be
a
matter
for
politics
and
beg
the
question
as
to
whether
there
be
something
in
the
Bill
that
can
speak
to
that
dynamic
.
I
welcome
the
legislation
.
I
seek
some
clarity
from
the
Minister
of
State
in
regard
to
the
registration
of
.ie
domain
name
which
be
not
hold
by
Irish
business
.
they
be
provide
service
into
Ireland
on
a
pretext
that
people
be
buy
from
a
Irish
website
.
if
that
service
be
be
procure
from
third
country
,
for
example
,
the
US
or
New
Zealand
,
what
rights
have
the
consumer
in
the
context
of
procure
from
a
.ie
domain
where
that
domain
be
not
register
in
Ireland
?
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
bring
the
legislation
before
we
.
he
will
be
very
much
aware
of
online
fraud
,
in
particular
,
with
regard
to
the
registration
of
.ie
domain
name
.
I
welcome
this
Bill
as
a
comprehensive
leap
forward
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
can
reassure
we
that
the
requisite
personnel
will
be
put
in
place
in
the
statutory
agency
that
will
regulate
this
space
,
such
as
ComReg
and
the
CCPC
,
that
will
give
consumer
great
confidence
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
on
amendment
no.

to
the
motion
on
affordable
housing
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
on
amendment
no.
1
to
the
motion
on
affordable
housing
.
in
the
short
time
that
I
have
,
there
be
many
point
that
I
wish
to
cover
.
I
want
to
start
with
the
BRIDE
project
,
which
will
be
familiar
to
many
people
who
be
concerned
with
biodiversity
and
partnership
with
the
agriculture
and
farming
sector
.
this
be
a
project
situate
in
north
County
Cork
.
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
visit
the
project
on
Monday
last
with
the
Labour
Party
leader
,
deputy
Ivana
Bacik
.
I
want
to
express
my
gratitude
to
Donal
Sheehan
,
Sinéad
Hickey
and
all
of
the
team
there
for
facilitate
we
in
what
be
a
great
learning
environment
and
a
wonderful
tutorial
.
the
model
be
a
very
simple
one
.
it
be
a
result
-
base
demonstration
project
that
be
design
to
increase
the
quantity
and
quality
of
habitat
on
intensely
manage
farmland
.
that
be
the
key
phrase
-
''
intensely
manage
farmland
''
.
the
project
be
locate
in
the
River
Bride
valley
of
north
County
Cork
and
it
will
explore
a
innovative
implementation
of
a
result
-
base
approach
for
wildlife
habitat
or
intensively
manage
farmland
.
it
aim
to
improve
biodiversity
and
environmental
awareness
on
intensive
Irish
farmland
,
reward
environmental
performance
and
highlight
this
nationally
.
it
be
also
there
to
facilitate
market
reward
for
sustainability
.
I
raise
this
because
it
be
part
of
a
European
innovation
project
which
be
fund
by
the
Department
.
it
have
key
partner
,
which
include
the
local
authority
,
Glanbia
,
Teagasc
,
Bord
Bia
,
the
National
Biodiversity
data
Centre
,
Kepak
and
Birdwatch
Ireland
.
I
hope
it
will
continue
to
be
fund
as
its
funding
line
run
out
at
the
end
of
this
year
,
as
I
understand
it
,
and
I
hope
the
minister
will
have
the
good
sense
to
continue
to
support
it
.
I
believe
the
42
farm
holding
that
be
involve
in
this
,
which
be
of
vary
size
and
have
different
offering
in
term
of
what
they
produce
,
form
a
key
model
.
when
the
new
CAP
come
in
,
particularly
in
regard
to
design
Pillar
ii
instrument
under
the
agri-environment
climate
measure
scheme
,
I
believe
this
be
a
key
project
that
would
plug
into
that
Pillar
ii
objective
.
if
we
can
get
farmer
to
devote
10
%
of
they
landholding
for
nature
without
lose
income
and
if
scheme
can
be
devise
,
such
as
the
bride
project
,
which
encourage
and
nudge
farmer
through
a
process
of
inspection
to
implement
more
environmental
goods
,
such
as
riparian
goods
,
grassland
margin
,
hedgerow
,
increase
biodiversity
and
so
forth
,
it
will
have
a
massive
impact
.
farmer
be
not
encourage
in
the
current
cap
to
give
more
to
that
margin
on
they
landholding
because
there
be
a
penalty
for
that
.
that
be
self
-
evident
,
as
we
all
know
.
if
the
minister
can
create
a
scheme
use
the
bride
project
as
a
model
,
by
which
he
would
design
a
agri-environmental
climate
measure
so
that
the
farmer
or
landholder
do
not
lose
income
but
,
in
fact
,
gain
income
through
a
process
as
devise
through
this
innovation
partnership
,
and
that
be
scale
up
,
scale
out
and
translate
throughout
the
country
,
the
minister
would
find
that
many
farmer
would
buy
into
it
.
we
be
increasingly
lose
biodiversity
.
that
be
self
-
evident
and
we
all
acknowledge
it
.
the
way
to
get
farmer
back
into
manage
the
countryside
be
to
ensure
there
be
a
financial
incentive
.
the
beautiful
thing
about
the
BRIDE
project
be
that
it
provide
financial
incentive
.
where
somebody
implement
sustainable
or
biodiversity
measure
,
there
be
a
mark
scheme
.
the
mark
scheme
determine
the
amount
of
money
the
person
will
gain
,
so
income
be
be
generate
for
the
farmer
.
I
will
leave
it
at
that
.
I
hope
the
project
will
continue
to
be
fund
and
I
would
love
the
BRIDE
project
to
be
plug
into
the
next
cap
under
the
Pillar
2
agri-environment
climate
measure
scheme
that
will
be
devise
.
that
would
be
a
good
thing
for
this
country
and
the
minister
would
find
many
farmer
would
participate
in
it
.
on
the
issue
of
forestry
,
there
have
be
many
repeat
promise
in
respect
of
forestry
growth
in
this
country
.
we
know
the
environmental
benefit
with
regard
to
sequestration
.
however
,
despite
the
repeat
promise
to
forest
owner
,
they
be
still
only
get
half
the
licence
require
to
meet
the
Department
's
target
.
it
be
just
not
enough
for
the
sector
.
be
we
get
any
close
to
have
licence
issue
within
a
acceptable
timeframe
of
120
day
?
the
answer
currently
be
"
no
"
.
second
,
be
we
go
to
meet
we
target
for
2022
?
we
plant
2000
ha
in
2021
,
but
it
appear
from
look
at
the
metric
that
we
will
end
up
with
few
than
2000
ha
for
2022
.
I
wish
there
be
a
great
sense
of
urgency
about
the
potential
of
the
forestry
sector
to
deliver
.
we
still
do
not
have
what
I
would
call
a
fit
-
for
-
purpose
ash
dieback
scheme
.
we
talk
about
the
great
game
of
hurl
but
,
and
I
have
raise
this
in
the
House
previously
,
there
have
be
no
progress
that
I
can
see
on
the
ash
dieback
scheme
.
forestry
be
one
of
the
sector
that
can
deliver
much
for
we
as
a
island
.
there
have
to
be
a
great
degree
of
political
imperative
put
behind
the
forestry
sector
to
make
sure
we
achieve
the
growth
target
that
be
necessary
to
sustain
the
sector
.
as
I
state
,
the
work
be
at
a
advanced
stage
.
I
know
that
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Noonan
,
be
recruiting
a
additional
120
ranger
,
which
be
double
what
be
there
in
2020
.
therefore
,
there
be
a
lot
of
good
work
ongoing
in
this
space
.
I
be
loath
to
interrupt
the
Taoiseach
but
we
must
maintain
the
speak
time
.
the
deputy
have
one
minute
leave
.
have
the
minister
's
Department
engage
in
research
in
respect
of
the
need
to
devise
a
disability
-
related
payment
to
deal
with
the
effect
of
long
Covid
?
I
acknowledge
the
existence
of
the
Covid
-
19
enhance
illness
benefit
payment
and
that
it
will
be
in
place
until
the
end
of
June
2022
.
my
reason
for
raise
this
be
that
we
seek
clarity
as
to
whether
there
will
be
continuity
of
that
payment
and
,
second
,
give
that
there
be
now
a
clinical
recognition
of
the
effect
of
long
Covid
,
whether
the
Department
be
respond
to
that
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
she
response
.
if
I
interpret
she
correctly
,
I
can
understand
she
retain
the
status
quo
because
the
nature
of
the
illness
benefit
be
clearly
define
in
term
of
what
a
person
must
do
to
meet
the
criterion
.
however
,
what
be
happen
now
in
this
country
,
and
there
be
robust
clinical
evidence
for
this
,
be
that
hospital
such
as
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
in
the
South
/
South
West
Hospital
Group
have
set
up
or
be
in
the
process
of
establish
long
Covid
clinic
.
that
will
be
replicate
throughout
the
country
.
if
somebody
move
from
the
enhance
illness
benefit
onto
the
illness
benefit
,
that
be
for
a
period
of
two
year
.
the
issue
be
the
period
thereafter
.
some
people
will
not
qualify
for
a
invalidity
pension
.
the
presentation
of
the
illness
they
present
with
,
even
though
it
have
be
determine
that
they
have
long
Covid
from
a
clinical
point
of
view
,
may
not
be
a
presentation
that
be
prescribe
under
the
term
of
the
Department
's
policy
.
that
be
why
I
be
raise
this
.
it
be
the
long
game
I
be
play
here
-----
-----
because
there
will
have
to
be
a
recognition
of
long
Covid
as
a
qualifying
condition
.
the
answer
to
my
question
be
"
no
"
;
that
be
the
short
answer
the
minister
be
give
.
I
acknowledge
that
but
I
will
continue
to
bang
the
drum
on
this
.
I
be
worried
that
there
be
a
statistically
significant
cohort
of
person
who
ordinarily
will
go
from
the
enhance
payment
to
illness
benefit
,
the
clock
will
tick
down
the
two
year
and
then
they
potentially
will
fall
off
the
cliff
if
they
be
not
eligible
to
move
onto
a
invalidity
or
long
-
term
payment
,
as
devise
by
the
Department
.
the
worry
I
have
for
that
people
be
that
the
department
might
be
too
stringent
in
how
it
apply
rule
and
the
criterion
that
they
must
meet
for
illness
benefit
payment
.
I
merely
ask
the
minister
to
carry
out
some
early
stage
research
,
perhaps
with
the
Department
of
Health
and
the
HSE
,
for
instance
,
to
see
how
long
Covid
be
affect
people
who
ordinarily
would
be
back
in
the
workplace
,
but
who
,
for
very
valid
clinically
indicate
reason
base
on
a
determination
that
it
be
due
to
long
Covid
,
will
not
be
back
in
the
workplace
any
time
soon
.
that
be
the
people
I
be
think
of
.
it
be
the
medical
certification
.
if
the
medical
certification
say
long
Covid
,
then
that
should
suffice
.
I
thank
the
minister
.
I
be
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
raise
this
issue
.
the
people
of
Youghal
be
very
exercise
about
the
decision
of
the
Court
Service
to
close
a
service
that
be
vital
to
people
and
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
Youghal
,
particularly
as
it
relate
to
the
victim
of
domestic
violence
.
as
my
colleague
,
deputy
Stanton
,
say
,
this
be
about
ensure
that
we
do
not
force
woman
who
be
subject
to
domestic
violence
and
who
be
seek
protection
order
to
go
from
Youghal
to
Cork
.
this
decision
take
a
service
further
away
from
the
people
who
be
most
vulnerable
and
most
in
need
of
it
.
I
ask
the
government
to
please
intervene
with
the
Court
Service
to
reverse
this
absolutely
disgraceful
decision
.
it
be
disgraceful
give
the
fact
that
the
Court
Service
invest
approximately
€
1.2
million
in
create
this
facility
in
the
first
instance
back
in
2008
.
we
have
testimonial
from
three
notable
solicitor
-
David
Keane
,
John
Brosnan
and
Karen
O'Shea
-
who
be
legal
representative
in
the
town
of
Youghal
.
they
be
on
the
public
record
as
say
that
this
be
a
Trojan
horse
for
get
rid
of
the
court
in
Youghal
itself
.
we
ask
the
government
to
please
reconsider
this
decision
and
to
use
its
good
office
to
intervene
with
the
Court
service
to
ensure
that
the
service
people
be
entitle
to
as
of
right
be
provide
.
person
must
have
good
administration
of
justice
without
impediment
.
you
cannot
create
a
situation
where
vulnerable
woman
who
be
subject
to
domestic
violence
will
have
to
get
on
bus
to
go
to
anglesea
Street
in
Cork
.
it
be
absolutely
disgraceful
.
I
respect
the
Minister
of
State
and
the
fact
she
do
not
have
policy
responsibility
for
this
area
.
the
response
by
the
government
be
not
adequate
for
the
purpose
of
ensure
the
administration
of
justice
,
as
articulate
by
the
concern
outline
by
the
law
officer
in
Youghal
,
by
the
user
of
the
service
and
by
the
citizen
.
we
be
in
a
situation
where
a
service
be
be
take
away
,
even
though
more
than
€
1
million
have
be
invest
.
to
throw
the
health
and
safety
argument
back
at
woman
who
have
suffer
the
indignity
and
hurt
of
domestic
violence
be
a
weak
response
.
I
do
not
personalise
that
comment
in
any
way
.
I
have
receive
the
same
email
as
my
colleague
,
deputy
Stanton
.
it
state
:
when
we
seek
this
protection
order
,
we
be
utterly
break
.
we
have
be
gaslighted
,
manipulate
,
intimidate
,
financially
abuse
,
sexually
abuse
,
physically
abuse
,
lie
to
,
cheat
on
,
isolate
from
we
friend
and
family
-
the
list
go
on
.
we
be
leave
question
we
sanity
,
ask
ourselves
,
"
what
be
wrong
with
I
?
"
we
have
to
protect
that
woman
and
that
service
.
I
agree
we
must
protect
that
woman
.

the

already

give

's
interest
be

allowable

the
amendment
speak
to
that
need
specifically
and
I
thank

bring
it
forward

I
must
now
deal

no.
1
in
the
name
of
the
Minister
for
Health
to
the
motion
regard
strike
action
by
the
Medical
Laboratory
scientist
Association
.
today
,
on
the
question
,
"
that
the
amendment
be
make
"
,
a
division
be
claim
,
and
that
division
must
be
take
now
.
I
welcome
and
support
the
motion
.
I
will
start
by
respond
to
the
minister
's
response
to
the
point
that
be
raise
in
the
motion
about
the
establishment
of
a
discretionary
fund
.
it
be
true
to
say
that
the
community
welfare
service
make
discretionary
payment
and
nobody
would
argue
against
that
.
what
worry
I
,
however
,
be
the
fact
that
the
number
of
people
who
be
receive
payment
be
not
very
high
,
especially
with
regard
to
exceptional
need
payment
and
urgent
need
payment
.
in
a
response
I
receive
directly
from
the
minister
,
I
be
tell
that
in
2021
,
more
than
2300
exceptional
need
payment
amount
to
€
750000
be
make
to
assist
with
household
bill
and
heating
cost
.
to
the
end
of
March
of
this
year
,
some
780
exceptional
need
payment
amount
to
€
167000
have
be
make
across
the
entire
State
to
assist
with
household
bill
and
heating
cost
.
most
of
we
in
this
House
have
be
around
a
long
time
.
we
all
deal
with
CWOs
and
the
Department
of
social
Protection
but
something
be
not
computing
in
respect
of
the
volume
of
figure
I
have
share
.
I
have
notice
a
trend
in
the
past
five
or
six
year
,
while
also
note
the
excellent
work
that
individual
cwo
do
for
they
client
,
service
user
and
people
who
come
to
they
,
in
exercising
they
discretion
.
we
do
not
have
the
exact
evidence
for
my
assertion
yet
but
one
hope
one
's
political
gut
hopefully
serve
one
well
.
a
centralise
tendency
be
creep
into
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
which
be
try
to
reduce
the
number
of
payment
that
be
go
out
under
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
or
through
exceptional
need
payment
and
urgent
need
payment
.
person
's
access
to
that
payment
be
be
suppress
.
that
be
not
happen
at
CWO
level
,
but
when
deal
with
people
who
come
to
my
office
,
I
find
I
be
more
often
ring
the
0818
number
.
there
be
increasingly
a
suppression
of
that
human
interaction
between
the
person
who
be
apply
and
the
decide
officer
.
the
point
be
that
I
believe
strongly
that
the
Department
be
by
stealth
try
to
take
the
discretionary
element
out
of
that
key
payment
.
we
agree
they
exist
but
we
also
agree
,
now
we
be
all
interact
with
each
other
again
,
that
we
need
to
go
back
to
a
model
whereby
people
can
have
a
walk
-
in
service
.
that
be
what
we
be
talk
about
.
we
want
the
walk
-
in
service
to
be
resume
.
we
need
the
element
of
discretion
to
be
embed
into
the
structure
again
.
I
do
not
understand
why
application
be
more
often
go
up
the
line
to
somebody
who
have
no
relationship
whatsoever
with
the
applicant
or
have
not
have
a
human
interaction
with
the
applicant
.
it
run
contrary
to
the
foundation
of
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
as
it
be
establish
by
former
deputy
Frank
Cluskey
all
that
year
ago
.
we
need
to
go
back
to
that
.
there
be
unmet
demand
out
there
.
person
find
it
difficult
to
engage
directly
and
increasingly
we
,
as
deputy
,
be
interface
to
try
to
contextualise
people
's
individual
story
.
we
all
know
what
the
story
be
.
we
know
exactly
where
people
be
struggle
.
it
be
well
evidence
at
this
stage
and
be
plain
for
everybody
to
see
.
it
be
not
just
people
who
depend
on
the
Department
of
social
Protection
for
they
income
who
be
struggle
.
the
working
poor
be
also
struggle
.
we
need
to
find
some
mechanism
,
through
scheme
such
as
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
,
for
example
,
to
provide
for
a
great
number
of
urgent
need
payment
.
I
be
pore
over
number
.
in
October
2021
,
24
urgent
need
payment
be
make
,
if
the
figure
I
receive
in
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
be
to
be
believe
and
we
take
the
figure
provide
by
the
Department
absolutely
at
face
value
.
in
November
,
36
such
payment
be
make
.
in
December
,
38
be
make
.
in
January
,
26
be
make
.
in
February
,
25
be
make
.
in
March
,
there
be
a
upward
spike
to
45
.
that
be
the
figure
for
urgent
need
payment
,
which
be
a
specific
category
.
that
number
worry
I
.
I
can
conclude
there
be
a
deliberate
suppression
in
the
number
of
people
who
be
apply
and
refuse
payment
.
we
do
not
have
that
figure
but
they
will
come
out
in
due
course
,
I
be
sure
,
when
the
right
question
be
ask
.
the
alternative
conclusion
be
that
the
level
of
discretion
have
be
take
away
.
neither
God
nor
man
could
convince
I
that
in
March
only
45
people
throughout
the
country
apply
specifically
for
urgent
need
payment
.
that
be
base
on
a
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
receive
lately
.
if
I
be
misquote
figure
,
somebody
will
correct
I
.
I
be
happy
to
be
correct
,
but
I
have
the
information
here
in
black
and
white
.
we
keep
raise
the
issue
of
the
fuel
allowance
and
access
to
it
.
I
know
it
be
not
the
most
important
topic
during
this
summer
month
.
however
,
it
will
not
be
long
until
we
be
into
the
autumn
and
winter
month
again
and
the
issue
will
be
high
on
the
political
agenda
.
I
have
call
previously
in
this
house
for
some
sort
of
scheme
to
be
put
in
place
for
certain
people
.
while
it
be
acknowledge
that
there
have
be
a
increase
in
the
fuel
allowance
for
that
in
receipt
of
it
,
there
be
a
whole
category
of
people
who
have
work
all
they
life
,
put
child
through
college
and
be
live
in
C-
,
d-
and
E
-
rate
house
.
they
do
not
have
access
to
grant
and
do
not
have
the
means
to
upgrade
they
house
,
but
they
could
very
well
do
with
a
additional
supplementary
payment
for
fuel
.
if
the
government
be
to
create
a
second
category
to
encapsulate
that
people
who
have
a
modest
occupational
pension
or
a
contributory
pension
and
who
do
not
meet
the
criterion
for
access
to
the
fuel
allowance
,
it
would
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
very
many
of
the
people
to
whom
I
refer
,
because
they
be
of
a
certain
age
,
would
have
vote
Fianna
Fáil
historically
.
it
would
be
a
fair
assessment
to
extrapolate
that
they
have
probably
turn
away
from
Fianna
Fáil
but
maybe
Fianna
Fáil
could
go
back
and
look
at
that
category
of
people
,
if
at
all
possible
.
I
urge
the
Green
Party
and
Fine
Gael
to
do
the
same
because
this
be
all
come
into
sharp
relief
at
a
time
when
there
be
a
fuel
crisis
.
that
be
a
very
obvious
thing
to
say
but
if
it
be
possible
to
create
a
second
category
for
the
fuel
allowance
that
would
encapsulate
far
more
people
,
that
would
give
they
just
a
little
bit
of
headroom
and
see
they
through
the
next
winter
.
the
same
minister
of
State
be
in
the
House
the
last
time
I
raise
this
during
the
debate
on
a
previous
motion
.
I
hope
to
address
the
line
minister
with
policy
responsibility
for
this
in
due
course
as
well
.
we
have
to
look
after
that
people
.
they
make
the
big
sacrifice
in
this
country
in
the
1970
and
1980
when
they
pay
big
money
in
taxation
and
still
they
be
able
to
educate
child
and
put
they
through
college
.
I
be
probably
a
product
of
that
system
,
dare
I
say
it
.
I
support
the
motion
.
it
be
a
worthwhile
motion
but
we
must
look
again
at
the
role
of
the
community
welfare
officer
.
we
need
to
buttress
that
facility
.
the
community
welfare
officer
that
I
deal
with
know
the
people
they
be
deal
with
well
.
they
know
the
personality
and
they
be
embed
within
they
community
.
the
level
of
discretion
they
have
be
paramount
and
be
key
to
protect
people
and
we
need
to
go
back
to
that
,
back
to
the
well
.
I
want
to
get
the
perspective
of
the
minister
on
she
late
interaction
with
the
mobile
phone
and
broadband
task
force
.
do
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
O'Brien
,
attend
the
meeting
as
well
?
the
minister
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
be
here
and
she
attend
the
meeting
,
so
I
be
not
sure
why
she
be
not
answer
the
question
.
I
understand
.
the
minister
be
share
the
load
.
I
accept
that
.
I
apologise
.
two
key
point
arise
from
that
deliberation
.
one
be
the
point
about
improve
outdoor
mobile
phone
coverage
.
I
acknowledge
that
a
lot
have
be
achieve
in
the
key
output
of
the
previous
task
force
of
improve
mobile
phone
coverage
in
rural
area
and
in
urban
blackspot
.
as
more
and
more
people
be
take
the
modal
shift
in
transport
from
private
car
travel
into
train
and
bus
travel
,
we
must
ensure
blackspot
be
address
,
in
particular
on
the
railway
line
,
for
instance
,
between
Cork
and
Dublin
,
which
be
a
service
people
use
.
be
such
service
be
consider
in
term
of
ensure
we
have
complete
100
%
coverage
?
I
think
we
all
acknowledge
the
work
.
we
also
acknowledge
that
the
coverage
of
mobile
telephony
could
be
improve
.
there
be
still
some
well
-
note
blackspot
.
we
all
know
of
they
within
we
constituency
.
if
we
could
find
some
mechanism
where
we
as
public
representative
could
notify
somebody
who
be
involved
in
the
task
force
of
this
specific
blackspot
,
we
would
be
serve
we
constituent
well
in
that
regard
.
I
refer
specifically
to
the
Cork
to
Dublin
railway
line
,
where
there
be
significant
blackspot
,
and
I
wonder
if
that
could
be
address
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
take
that
message
back
,
I
would
be
most
grateful
.
I
take
that
point
on
board
.
there
be
very
important
issue
raise
by
the
deputy
that
we
have
to
address
.
the
processing
time
of
individual
loan
can
legitimately
vary
.
there
may
be
specific
information
require
to
confirm
eligibility
or
creditworthiness
,
depend
on
the
fact
of
the
case
.
there
may
be
delay
in
the
transaction
that
be
not
under
the
control
of
the
local
authority
,
but
I
accept
that
there
may
be
some
variation
in
processing
time
across
local
authority
.
I
agree
with
you
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
,
that
this
need

be

I
will
ask
my
department
to
look
into
the
concern
deputy
Colm
Burke
have
raise
this
evening
.
it
be
really

we
do
so
.
the
last
thing
we
want
be
to
inhibit
family
from
take
up
the
important

to
be
able
to
purchase
a
home

there
be

conflict
go
on
in

while
one
be
minded

support

the
fact
be
that
so
much
appear
to
be
leave
out
or
have
not
come
under
great
scrutiny
prior
to
its
publication

promulgation
here

.
member
feel
they
be
be
rush
into
support
legislation
they
believe
may
not
adequately
address
the
entirety
of
the
issue
,
as
articulate
by
previous
speaker
.
we
feel
as
if
we
be
be
rush
into
a
process
.
while
recognise
the
importance
of
the
legislation
,
we
believe
it
be
be
rush
for
reason
of
political
expediency
at
this
stage
.
we
be
ask
ourselves
,
why
the
rush
now
?
why
not
take
a
little
more
time
to
consider
the
issue
therein
so
we
can
be
sure
we
can
all
support
the
Bill
and
have
a
very
clear
and
clean
conscience
when
do
so
?
there
be
a
paper
that
be
a
very
useful
and
objective
critique
of
the
Bill
before
we
.
it
be
from
the
Centre
for
Disability
Law
and
Policy
at
the
National
University
of
Ireland

I
will
quote
directly
from
it
because
it
exactly
summarise
the
concern
I
have
.
I
will
openly
admit
to
not
have
the
ability
to
interrogate
this
Bill
properly
,
and
not
fully
have
the
skill
set
require
of
I
as
a
member
to
be
able
to
interrogate
every
dot
and
every
line
of
this
legislation
.
I
wish
for
more
time
to
learn
more
about
what
it
be
we
be
expect
to
pass
.
I
openly
admit
I
be
no
specialist
in
this
area
of
law

I
would
have
like
more
time

when

I
have
since
write
to

request
to
meet
with
the

[
I
know
the
Minister

will
tell
we
this
do
not
come
under
the
Department
of
Justice
but
the
Department
of
Health
,
which
we
accept
]
to
discuss
that
concern
with
a
view
to
have
they
resolve
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
decision
support
service
and
discharge
of
ward
.
there
be
people
from
all
part
of
the
country
involve
,
include
you
own
area
and
because
of
they
unique
circumstance
many
cannot
go
public
with
this
so
as
not
to
identify
ward
.
we
would
be
grateful
for
a
response
.
this
be
the
other
side
of
the
coin
,
so
to
speak
.
we
be
engage
on
two
front
-
ensure
that
the
legislation
underpin
the
dss
and
related
area
be
appropriate
and
ensure
that
the
dss
be
fit
for
purpose
.
there
have
be
no
engagement
with
Justice
for
Wards
,
Wards
of

or
they
family
by
either
the
Office
of
Wards
of
Court
or
the
decision
support
Service
.
many
family
have
no
idea
what
be
happen
and
if
the
online
joint
presentation
direct
at
Wards
and
they
family
yesterday
be
any
indication
of
the
type
of
communication
,
engagement
and
information
we
be
go
to
get
,
it
demonstrate
how
out
of
touch
they
be
with
this
people
and
they
concern
,
need
and
understanding
of
this
change
.
many
do
not
have
internet
or
resource
to
engage
.
that
be
also
a
point
worth
bear
in
mind
and
be
a
genuine
perspective

Ms

Farrell
further
correspond
with
I
on
25
May

again
,
it
be
a
outline
of
she
concern
that
I
will
read
into
the
record
:
dear
minister
O'Gorman
I
be
write
to
you
as
spokesperson
for
Justice
for
Wards
,
to
express
we
concern
...
[
that
]
the
draft
code
of
practice
on
the

-
make
(
capacity
)
act
2015
which
have
be
present
for
you
approval
by
the
decision
support
service
.
in
short
,
we
believe
the
draft
code
be
not
fit
for
purpose
and
should
not
be
publish
in
they
current
form
,
and
we
urge
you
not
to
approve
this
draft
for
publication
until
significant
change
have
be
make
.
member
of
Justice
for
Wards
have
be
campaign
for
change
to
the
archaic
Wardship
system
for
many
year
-
since
the
State
sign
the
UNCRPD
in
2007
to
the
eventual
signing
of
the
assisted
decision
-
make
(
Capacity
)
Act
2015
.
we
now
know
that
the
finish
line
be
to
be
a
long
way
off
for
that
who
be
lock
into
the
Wardship
system
for
they
lifetime
with
no
route
out
.
this
matter
have
rumble
on
for
...
too
long
,
with
delay
at
every
turn
,
and
now
,
after
7
year
,
the
decision
support
service
's
code
of
practice
be
of
concern
.
[
I
be
merely
read
into
the
record
the
perspective
of
somebody
who
be
directly
involved
with
this
.
I
will
appreciate
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
]
the
consultation
process
for
the
Draft
code
be
not
fully
accessible
to
,
or
meaningfully
inclusive
of
,
people
directly
affect
by
this
law
-
include
and
particularly
the
current
main
stakeholder
,
ward
of
Court
,
they
committee
and
family
;
disabled
people
;
people
with
intellectual
disability
;
people
with
experience
of
mental
health
service
;
neurodivergent
people
and
old
people
.
the
period
for
which
the
Draft
code
be
open
for
public
consultation
be
too
short
,
submission
be
only
permit
in
write
format
,
and
the
questionnaire
be
not
make
available
in
alternative
format
such
as
easy
to
read
.
this
inaccessible
consultation
have
be
criticise
by
the
Oireachtas
committee
on
child
,
Equality
,
disability
,
integration
and
youth
in
its
pre-legislative
scrutiny
report
on
the

make

there
have
be
no
engagement
by
the
Office
of
Wards
of
Court
or
the
decision
support
Service
with
Wards
,
they
family
or
committee
.
this
be
very
concerning
.
it
do
not
bide
well
for
future
communication
.
the
content
of
the
draft
code
be
not
compatible
with
Ireland
's
obligation
under
human
rights
law
,
specifically
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Right
of
Person
with
Disability
.
in
we
view
,
the
draft
code
do
not
accurately
represent
the
spirit
and
letter
of
the
assist
decision
-
make
(
capacity
)
act
,
which
be
intend
to
give
people
more
choice
and
control
over
they
decision
-
making
,
not
less
.
in
a
number
of
place
the
draft
code
give
the
impression
that
a
wide
range
of
individual
(
include
legal
professional
,
financial
professional
and
healthcare
professional
)
can
assess
a
person
's
capacity
under
the
act
,
when
in
fact
the
act
make
clear
that
only
the
court
be
empower
to
declare
a
person
to
lack
capacity
.
the
core
human
rights
value
of
respect
for
the
will
and
preference
of
the
person
,
which
be
hard
-
fight
for
in
the
2015
Act
[
and
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
have
already
refer
]
,
be
not
sufficiently
prioritise
across
the
draft
code
,
and
there
be
little
to
no
guidance
to
that
act
in
role
under
the
act
on
how
to
discover
,
interpret
,
and
act
upon
,
the
person
's
will
and
preference
.
we
have
try
to
engage
with
the
decision
support
service
but
we
effort
have
not
be
well
receive
.
the
decision
support
Service
have
not
produce
any
document
as
a
result
of
the
public
consultation
outline
the
key
message
receive
and
propose
action
as
a
result
.
we
know
that
people
have
be
wait
a
long
time
for
reform
of
Ireland
's
capacity
law
,
especially
ward
and
they
family
but
to
press
ahead
with
the
publication
of
this
code
without
meaningful
engagement
with
people
directly
affect
by
this
law
,
will
ultimately
be
counterproductive
for
everyone
involve
.
we
once
again
urge
you
not
to
approve
this
draft
code
when
present
to
you
,
and
to
request
the
decision
support
service
at
a
minimum
:
-
Publish
the
key
finding
from
the
public
consultation
and
action
to
be
take
as

result
-
undertake
meaningful
engagement

with
a
view
to
make
further
change
to
the
draft
code
to
bring
they
into
great
compliance
with

in
a
transparent
and

we
be
happy
to
provide
you
with
further
information

yours
sincerely
Mary
Farrell
spokesperson
Justice
for
Wards
of
Court
arise
from
the
intervention
I
have
just
make
,
could
some
form
of
communication
be
open
up
with
Justice
for
Wards
of
Court
?
if
only
to
intervene
or
engage
with
the
group
on
its
concern
,
that
would
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
that
be
my
only
request
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
be
grateful
for
she
intercession
in
that
regard
.
I
be
genuinely
delighted
that
she
have
undertake
to
do
that
.
she
know
the
group
-
its
member
be
reasonable
and
decent
people
.
if
they
could
just
get
some
qualitative
engagement
with
the
process
,
it
would
be
a
first
step
.
although
I
have
a
few
minute
leave
,
I
do
not
want
to
tarry
for
too
long
except
to
say
that
the
member
of
Justice
for
Wards
of
Court
feel
that
they
have
be
jettison
by
the
process
and
do
not
feel
a
part
of
it
.
if
we
ensure
that
they
be
include
,
it
would
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
I
anticipate
that
the
minister
will
reject
the
amendment
,
but
I
do
not
understand
why
.
when
the
minister
be
in
opposition
,
he
and
I
serve
on
the
joint
committee
arise
from
the
citizen
's
Assembly
in
respect
of
climate
action
.
the
minister
be
very
strong
in
he
rhetoric
on
the
whole
issue
of
just
transition
.
if
I
recall
correctly
,
the
Green
Party
produce
a
Bill
on
the
principle
of
the
just
transition
.
we
be
all
broadly
in
agreement
and
we
need
to
insert
the
principle
in
legislation
.
the
amendment
before
we
be
a
sound
amendment
in
what
it
seek
to
achieve
.
deputy
O'Rourke
already
refer
to
the
Scottish
example
which
have
be
well
signal
.
I
do
not
see
why
we
could
not
follow
suit
or
at
least
seek
to
have
this
principle
insert
across
a
plethora
of
legislation
which
be
go
through
this
House
.
it
should
be
embed
firmly
across
legislation
in
a
way
that
ensure
we
be
act
appropriately
in
respect
of
climate
action
.
I
see
no
reason
the
House
should
reject
a
amendment
of
this
nature
.
it
seem
to
be
eminently
sensible
.
forgive
I
if
I
misunderste
the
minister
.
I
would
have
think
that
this
be
the
most
appropriate
place
in
which
to
promulgate
idea
such
as
we
propose
amendment
.
all
too
often
we
do
not
give
ourselves
enough
credit
for
discuss
deeply
issue
such
as
this
.
many
of
we
,
include
the
minister
,
have
seek
to
emb
this
in
legislation
.
we
now
have
a
golden
opportunity
in
this
legislation
to
do
that
.
while
I
accept
it
be
important
to
coalesce
with
that
who
be
outside
this
House
,
it
be
also
important
to
take
the
view
of
people
within
this
House
seriously
.
I
welcome
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
in
bring
forward
this
amendment
as
a
genuine
attempt
to
deal
with
the
issue
therein
.
on
the
issue
of
person
who
be
seek
to
reduce
they
waste
,
especially
people
who
have
particular
need
,
for
instance
,
with
incontinence
,
in
2017
there
be
a
government
decision
on
the
need
to
introduce
a
waste
waiver
in
that
regard
.
we
have
not
see
this
yet
.
it
be
the
subject
of
a
amendment
here
.
if
we
be
serious
about
ensure
we
include
everybody
,
I
believe
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
Bill
to
deal
with
that
issue
also
.
in
bring
forward
further
legislation
,
which
the
minister
say
he
intend
to
do
as
thing
change
,
I
ask
that
we
would
give
due
recognition
to
people
who
require
waiver
and
who
have
no
way
of
reduce
they
waste
because
of
medical
issue
.
I
ask
that
we
recognise
that
people
and
that
consideration
be
give
to
the
introduction
of
the
waste
waiver
.
it
be
a
government
decision
of
2017
.
I
should
know
whether
government
decision
fall
when
the
mandate
fall
.
I
do
not
think
they
do
but
I
will
be
guide
by
the
Ceann
Comhairle
.
it
be
a
government
decision
regardless
of
who
be
in
government
.
I
hope
this
could
be
revisit
.
I
be
certainly
try
to
put
it
into
the
mind
of
the
minister
.
there
be
people
who
would
have
reasonably
expect
a
scheme
for
waive
fee
for
some
household
waste
collection
service
for
the
benefit
of
household
where
,
by
reason
of
medical
illness
or
disability
,
include
a
illness
or
disability
that
give
rise
to
the
need
for
incontinence
wear
,
a
disproportionate
amount
of
household
waste
be
present
for
collection
.
the
purpose
of
such
a
waiver
would
be
to
give
recognition
to
that
people
and
transpose
the
government
decision
into
legislation
.
I
too
welcome
this
amendment
.
it
set
out
a
very
clear
strategy
.
I
will
speak
very
briefly
about
electronic
equipment
.
the
minister
will
be
aware
of
the
"
right
to
repair
"
movement
,
which
be
gather
a
head
of
steam
globally
.
this
apply
to
all
of
we
and
we
personal
consumption
,
particularly
of
electronic
goods
and
white
goods
such
as
smartphone
.
the
concept
of
build
-
in
obsolescence
be
become
quite
painful
for
consumer
.
it
be
annoying
that
we
cannot
have
recourse
to
repair
for
a
product
we
have
purchase
.
the
minister
will
say
we
do
not
want
to
move
ahead
of
EU
law
in
relation
to
harmonisation
rule
.
I
anticipate
he
reply
and
I
appreciate
that
dynamic
but
we
should
take
due
cognisance
of
this
movement
around
the
right
to
repair
.
on
this
small
little
island
,
we
be
sit
on
mountain
of
electronic
detritus
.
it
be
the
same
detritus
that
20
year
ago
we
would
have
seek
to
repair
,
for
example
,
a
toaster
,
dishwasher
or
phone
.
person
be
sick
to
the
back
tooth
of
this
build
-
in
obsolescence
and
have
to
replace
goods
annually
or
biannually
.
it
be
just
not
good
enough
.
if
we
can
be
the
first
country
in
the
world
to
move
head
of
the
European
Union
,
we
should
be
that
radical
and
ambitious
.
if
we
can
instil
within
circular
economy
legislation
this
concept
of
the
right
to
repair
,
allow
independent
business
to
repair
product
make
by
the
likes
of
Apple
,
Samsung
and
so
on
,
we
should
seek
to
embrace
that
.
I
hope
that
concept
will
be
instil
within
the
subsection
that
deal
specifically
with
electronic
equipment
.
I
move
amendment
no.

it

I
welcome
this
debate

I
welcome
the
engagement

the
minister

although
I
be
come
to
the
Bill
at
a

I
appreciate

the

have
seek
to
engage
seriously
with
the
deliberation
that
take
place
on
Committee
stage

reflect
they
on
this
stage

the
issue
I
wish
to
repeat
be
build

in
obsolescence

in
electronic

if
the

take
away
one
thing
tonight
to
bring
to
the
Council
of
Minister
meeting
he
attend

it
be
that
we
must
have
some
form
of
critique
of
the
capitalist
model
that
take
away
from
the
consumer
the
right
to
repair
something
such
as
a
iPhone

equally
,
consumer
must
not

give
the
whip

Apple

Samsung

any
of
this
big

arguably
,
give
the
current
model
we
have
in
Europe
,
they
have
great
traction
with
the
European
Commission
than
perhaps
a
Council
of
Minister
might
have
.
if
strong
minister
at
the
Council
push
back
against
this
big
conglomerate
in
a
way
that
protect
the
citizen
and
consumer
of
Europe

so
that
citizen
have
that
right

they
would

I
note
that
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Butler
,
be
give
the
reply
which
will
have
be
give
to
she
.
I
do
not
expect
the
Minister
of
State
necessarily
to
be
in
charge
of
this
particular
issue
.
I
want
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
Brexit
Adjustment
Reserve
,
bar
,
fund
,
as
it
relate
to
the
fishing
industry
.
I
anticipate
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
tell
I
they
be
work
on
it
and
that
it
be
open
to
the
SME
sector
.
this
fund
be
set
up
to
ensure
that
money
flow
into
the
fishing
industry
to
meet
the
effect
of
Brexit
.
this
be
money
that
could
very
easily
go
into
the
fishing
industry
to
allow
for
support
for
processing
in
particular
in
a
way
that
ensure
job
be
maintain
,
capital
investment
be
make
and
innovation
can
be
bring
to
the
industry
to
allow
it
to
at
least
survive
in
the
tooth
of
the
storm
that
be
Brexit
and
its
impact
.
I
have
be
in
contact
with
the
Irish
Fish
Processor
and
Exporters
Association
,
IFPEA
.
it
tell
I
six
large
company
be
now
exclude
from
the
processing
capital
investment
scheme
result
from
bar
.
this
be
completely
wrong
and
contrary
to
the
principle
of
the
Brexit
Adjustment
Reserve
,
where
no
one
be
leave
behind
.
the
six
project
earmark
by
this
company
would
have
a
massive
positive
impact
in
they
respective
community
and
would
also
be
real
driver
for
change
within
the
fishing
industry
,
create
new
employment
and
great
value
in
export
.
they
would
sustain
they
company
with
product
diversification
and
high
-
end
value
add
.
as
a
member
state
,
Ireland
should
be
highlight
and
push
forward
project
such
as
this
as
oppose
to
the
current
approach
where
the
fund
be
deem
to
be
accessible
only
to
sme
.
the
Minister
of
State
may
refer
to
the
issue
of
state
aid
rule
in
she
reply
.
when
he
visit
Killybegs
in
September
2021
,
the
commissioner
for
fishery
say
that
there
be
no
state
aid
rule
and
we
have
absolute
flexibility
to
prioritise
we
funding
.
we
could
open
that
up
to
large
producer
and
bring
they
under
the
scheme
as
well
.
that
flexibility
be
key
to
ensure
there
be
a
successful
scheme
.
the
large
company
themselves
can
grow
the
number
of
employee
they
have
.
there
be
the
issue
of
sub
-supply
of
plant
and
machinery
into
the
sector
under
the
capital
expenditure
element
.
contractor
be
ready
,
willing
and
able
to
provide
service
.
they
be
all
wait
for
news
of
this
scheme
.
increasingly
they
be
become
frustrate
by
the
fact
that
the
scheme
be
not
up
and
run
and
that
the
manner
in
which
the
scheme
be
devise
exclude
large
processor
.
I
be
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
take
that
on
board
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
when
the
scheme
be
be
set
up
,
there
be
a
interaction
with
the
task
force
and
discussion
on
this
issue
.
my
understanding
be
that
the
recommendation
of
the
seafood
task
force
be
to
support
all
sector
of
the
industry
equally
because
no
sector
of
the
Irish
fishing
industry
escape
the
negative
impact
of
the
Brexit
deal
.
Enterprise
Ireland
interven
at
the
task
force
to
outline
where
flexibility
exist
and
how
state
aid
would
permit
support
to
the
non-SME
sector
,
similar
to
what
occur
during
Covid
.
it
be
self
evident
at
the
task
force
meeting
that
some
people
within
the
Department
have
a
ideological
difficulty
with
the
State
support
certain
sector
of
the
fishing
industry
even
though
the
European
Commission
clearly
permit
it
and
actively
encourage
it
.
the
evidence
of
that
be
the
statement
of
the
fishery
commissioner
to
which
I
refer
.
in
addition
,
we
have
the
remark
of
Elisa
Ferreira
,
the
Commissioner
for
Cohesion
and
Reforms
,
who
state
:
in
move
forward
,
we
do
not
want
to
leave
anyone
behind
.
the
funding
that
Ireland
will
receive
will
contribute
to
improve
living
standard
,
support
economic
growth
in
the
country
and
mitigate
the
negative
impact
in
local
community
.
that
be
fishing
and
coastal
community
.
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
we
want
to
see
the
money
flow
.
money
need
to
start
flow
into
that
community
and
into
processing
,
along
with
provide
real
-
time
support
for
a
sector
that
all
present
will
agree
have
take
a
hammering
as
a
result
of
Brexit
.
we
do
not
want
to
be
create
bureaucratic
entanglement
that
prevent
money
from
flow
into
the
community
that
so
badly
need
it
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
time
for
a
reply
.
before
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Butler
,
leave
,
I
wish
to
acknowledge
that
both
she
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
to
be
fair
to
they
,
have
go
out
and
meet
the
people
involve
and
tackle
this
issue
head
on
and
they
be
not
sit
behind
they
desk
in
they
Department
.
on
that
basis
,
before
she
leave
,
I
want
to
acknowledge
the
work
she
be
do
.
I
also
raise
the
issue
of
the
St.
Francis
welfare
home
in
Fermoy
,
which
be
redesignate
during
the
pandemic
as
a
transitional
care
facility
.
my
understanding
be
that
it
be
to
close
temporarily
.
I
just
want
to
raise
that
with
the
Minister
of
State
and
acknowledge
she
work
before
she
leave
.
I
be
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
to
support
the
motion
put
forward
by
the
independent
Group
.
it
be
a
vital
motion
and
I
be
glad
the
government
be
not
oppose
it
.
it
have
come
to
my
attention
that
recruitment
seem
to
be
at
the
heart
of
this
issue
.
we
keep
be
tell
by
the
HSE
and
the
government
that
the
lack
of
personnel
to
meet
the
demand
be
one
of
the
basic
issue
.
I
have
receive
response
to
parliamentary
question
about
this
.
I
ask
the
government
how
much
it
be
spend
on
recruitment
via
the
HSE
,
that
be
,
money
be
give
to
recruitment
company
to
recruit
the
talent
that
be
require
to
meet
demand
,
particularly
in
respect
of
respite
,
which
be
the
subject
of
this
motion
.
for
2020
and
2021
,
€
12
million
be
hand
over
to
recruitment
company
to
sort
this
issue
.
what
be
we
spend
the
money
on
?
where
be
the
value
for
money
?
why
be
it
that
they
have
not
succeed
in
recruiting
the
staff
we
need
to
meet
the
demand
of
people
in
this
sector
who
so
badly
need
the
service
?
we
need
to
start
audit
and
question
the
amount
of
money
be
spend
by
the
HSE
.
it
have
spend
€
12
million
in
the
last
two
year
on
recruitment
company
to
recruit
staff
.
I
be
be
objective
here
but
no
one
could
argue
that
we
be
get
value
for
money
with
that
kind
of
spend
.
if
we
be
,
we
would
have
the
staff
in
place
to
meet
the
need
.
the
one
issue
I
be
constantly
raise
be
that
of
Cooleens
House
,
which
be
under
the
ambit
of
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
.
I
be
be
tell
month
in
,
month
out
and
week
in
,
week
out
,
that
recruitment
be
at
the
heart
of
the
issue
and
that
the
centre
cannot
be
reopen
to
allow
people
to
avail
of
the
service
because
it
cannot
recruit
the
require
staff
.
one
can
only
accept
that
answer
for
so
long
.
if
we
be
spend
€
12
million
,
surely
to
goodness
that
money
,
wherever
it
be
be
deploy
,
could
find
somebody
to
be
able
to
reopen
that
facility
.
a
person
in
charge
be
require
.
on
top
of
that
,
there
be
a
Darwinian
competition
go
on
whereby
the
HSE
be
take
staff
away
from
section
38
and
39
organisation
.
the
HSE
be
compete
with
voluntary
organisation
for
staff
,
which
the
HSE
be
responsible
for
provide
in
the
first
instance
.
Cooleens
house
be
like
every
other
respite
facility
throughout
the
country
.
I
only
use
that
example
because
it
be
one
I
be
familiar
with
.
we
need
to
grasp
the
nettle
in
respect
of
the
recruitment
issue
.
for
two
year
now
we
be
be
tell
the
issue
be
recruitment
and
that
we
cannot
recruit
the
staff
.
I
do
not
think
we
be
buy
that
anymore
.
we
have
be
quite
patient
and
people
have
understand
that
there
be
a
recruitment
issue
but
it
be
time
for
we
to
start
drill
down
and
get
into
the
weed
of
why
we
cannot
recruit
staff
in
a
way
that
meet
the
demand
and
the
need
of
people
who
be
affect
.
speaker
after
speaker
have
say
that
family
be
come
to
we
as
deputy
and
Senator
say
they
cannot
get
respite
care
for
they
love
one
.
when
we
question
why
that
be
,
we
be
tell
it
be
because
we
do
not
have
enough
staff
in
the
system
.
we
need
to
start
drill
down
into
why
that
be
and
how
we
can
justify
spend
€
12
million
.
the
government
,
through
the
HSE
,
have
spend
€
12
million
in
the
last
two
year
give
money
to
recruitment
agency
.
what
be
they
do
for
that
money
?
that
be
the
question
.
I
welcome
this
motion
.
as
I
say
,
I
be
glad
the
minister
be
not
oppose
it
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
pay
parity
between
section
39
organisation
and
the
HSE
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
have
have
meeting
with
the
National
Federation
of
voluntary
Bodie
,
FEDVOL
,
in
respect
of
that
and
I
understand
that
around
€
20
million
be
need
.
the
reason
I
be
raise
that
issue
be
that
there
be
two
cohort
of
people
who
be
effectively
do
the
same
job
but
because
of
a
different
governance
structure
,
one
set
of
worker
be
pay
less
than
the
other
.
tackle
that
issue
would
go
some
way
towards
solve
the
problem
of
recruitment
.
we
need
a
bit
of
energy
around
this
piece
of
it
.
it
be
not
fair
at
a
time
like
this
.
I
will
go
back
to
Cooleens
House
.
when
I
question
the
Minister
of
State
about
Cooleens
House
,
she
note
that
it
have
six
room
and
provide
enormous
capacity
for
respite
in
north
Cork
.
she
acknowledge
that
the
challenge
of
recruiting
a
person
in
charge
be
what
be
prevent
it
from
be
reopen
.
I
support
the
motion
.
I
be
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
but
we
need
to
start
look
at
the
recruitment
issue
.
it
have
be
throw
back
at
we
as
the
reason
for
the
delay
or
the
inability
to
provide
service
.
we
be
not
accept
it
anymore
as
a
reason
.
it
can
be
solve
.
the
HSE
must
be
question
and
interrogate
more
on
how
it
can
justify
that
kind
of
spend
at
a
time
when
people
be
cry
out
for
service
.
you
party
will
be
boss
soon
enough
.
I
thank
deputy
Nash
for
share
he
time
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
flood
alleviation
work
and
the
challenge
people
face
when
they
seek
to
purchase
insurance
in
area
where
Office
of
Public
Works
,
OPW
,
flood
mitigation
project
have
already
be
complete
.
I
specifically
refer
to
the
Munster
Blackwater
in
town
like
Fermoy
and
Mallow
,
as
well
as
place
in
Cork
city
where
we
do
not
yet
have
full
opw
scheme
under
way
,
where
there
be
a
massive
difficulty
on
the
part
of
business
and
resident
to
acquire
insurance
.
when
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
be
in
opposition
,
he
put
forward
the
Flood
Insurance
Bill
2016
.
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
ensure
that
people
who
work
,
reside
or
have
business
in
area
where
flood
relief
scheme
be
implement
would
be
able
to
get
insurance
cover
.
I
understand
that
Bill
die
when
the
last
mandate
end
.
I
make
no
apology
in
say
I
will
now
bring
that
Bill
forward
,
line
for
line
,
in
my
name
.
we
will
put
it
to
the
test
and
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
if
a
member
of
Fianna
Fáil
do
not
put
forward
the
same
Bill
in
the
intervene
period
,
in
which
case
I
would
be
very
happy
to
yield
,
I
will
put
forward
that
Bill
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
to
test
the
theory
that
Fianna
Fáil
will
be
serious
about
ensure
that
people
who
live
in
area
where
flood
alleviation
work
have
be
carry
out
will
be
able
to
get
that
cover
.
while
I
be
speak
about
flood
alleviation
work
and
the
OPW
,
that
scheme
in
Fermoy
cost
€
30
million
.
it
be
a
fine
scheme
.
a
incident
take
place
there
on
21
February
last
year
,
when
a
small
number
of
premise
be
adversely
affect
and
be
flood
.
the
owner
of
that
premise
have
yet
to
receive
any
kind
of
compensation
or
report
in
respect
of
what
take
place
there
.
this
be
relevant
to
the
insurance
issue
because
when
incident
like
this
occur
,
where
relief
work
do
not
work
completely
and
there
be
a
breakdown
somewhere
,
and
where
we
do
not
have
sight
of
the
report
in
respect
of
Fermoy
,
it
feed
into
the
narrative
from
the
insurance
company
that
they
do
not
have
to
cover
this
town
where
work
have
be
carry
out
.
it
strengthen
they
hand
.
I
be
hopeful
,
in
put
forward
the
Flood
Insurance
Bill
that
,
as
I
say
,
a
member
of
Fianna
Fáil
or
the
government
will
come
forward
and
now
promulgate
this
Bill
,
which
be
initiate
by
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Michael
McGrath
.
if
they
do
so
,
I
will
happily
withdraw
my
Bill
.
we
will
test
the
government
on
that
to
see
if
it
be
serious
about
provide
flood
insurance
cover
in
that
area
.

I
thank
the
minister
,
deputy
and
member
of
the
House
staff
for
they
co-operation
.
some
25
minute
late
than
schedule
,
that
conclude
the
day
's
business
.
hear
,
hear
.
I
support
the
motion
.
like
my
colleague
,
I
will
raise
the
issue
of
the
promise
independent
review
of
testimony
.
we
have
Elaine
Loughlin
and
Conall
Ó
Fátharta
of
the
Irish
Examiner
to
thank
for
the
report
in
that
newspaper
date
29
August
in
which
it
be
say
that
"
a
promise
independent
review
of
testimony
give
by
mother
and
baby
home
survivor
have
now
be
abandon
by
the
government
.
"
I
understand
that
the
minister
be
speak
directly
to
a
motion
in
respect
of
the
creation
of
the
office
of
director
of
authorise
intervention
in
respect
of
Tuam
.
however
,
this
would
have
be
the
first
opportunity
since
this
news
break
in
August
for
the
minister
to
make
some
utterance
to
the
House
in
respect
of
why
the
promise
independent
review
of
testimony
have
now
be
abandon
.
for
many
people
,
whether
in
Tuam
,
Bessborough
,
or
wherever
,
that
be
the
kernel
of
the
issue
right
now
.
they
feel
deeply
traumatise
by
the
fact
that
the
independent
review
be
not
now
go
to
take
place
.
it
be
for
we
to
speak
for
that
people
.
it
be
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
ask
that
people
who
have
give
testimony
already
to
now
create
a
new
initiative
.
I
will
quote
from
the
minister
's
adviser
,
who
I
assume
issue
the
statement
.
it
read
:
have
consider
the
matter
,
the
minister
believe
that
a
new
initiative
to
support
survivor
to
tell
they
personal
story
,
so
that
it
can
be
formally
record
and
accept
as
part
of
the
official
record
,
provide
the
good
opportunity
for
respond
to
the
concern
of
survivor
in
a
meaningful
way
.
to
expect
a
person
who
have
already
give
evidence
to
now
submit
evidence
again
be
a
insult
to
that
people
.
I
cannot
for
the
life
of
I
see
how
the
creation
of
a
museum
or
a
national
centre
for
research
and
remembrance
will
have
the
confidence
of
that
very
people
who
have
give
evidence
and
who
feel
they
effort
and
the
sheer
trauma
they
have
to
go
through
to
tell
they
story
have
be
abandon
and
disregard
.
I
be
very
hopeful
that
we
be
on
a
pathway
with
this
process
and
that
by
at
least
put
in
place
a
independent
review
of
the
testimony
,
the
minister
would
have
repair
the
damage
do
and
people
would
have
move
in
the
same
direction
go
forward
.
until
such
time
as
that
issue
be
deal
with
and
confront
,
and
until
a
independent
review
be
carry
out
of
testimony
,
nobody
be
go
to
have
any
confidence
whatsoever
in
the
process
.
the
entirety
of
the
process
be
now
taint
.
I
be
hopeful
that
we
generation
of
politician
would
have
deal
with
this
head
-
on
.
when
we
be
in
the
national
convention
centre
I
say
I
hope
this
would
not
come
down
to
a
issue
of
money
and
resource
.
I
fear
now
that
that
be
where
this
be
at
.
I
be
fearful
that
the
minister
be
afraid
to
reopen
this
process
again
on
the
basis
of
resource
and
what
type
of
potential
litigation
might
take
place
as
a
result
of
the
reopening
of
such
a
process
.
I
do
not
think
we
should
be
so
cautious
.
we
should
be
the
generation
of
politician
that
deal
with
this
head
-
on
.
we
owe
a
duty
of
care
to
everybody
who
be
involved
in
this
issue
to
at
least
,
as
a
mark
of
respect
,
carry
out
the
independent
review
of
testimony

there
be
a
question
for
the
minister
in
respect
of
the
propose
memorandum
to
go
to
cabinet
.
as
a
institution
,
whether
on
the
floor
of
this
House
or
in
committee
,
we
need
to
provide
some
forum
where
the
minister
can
come
before
we
to
answer
question
about
why
a
process
to
create
that
independent
review
of
testimony
be
abandon
.
what
be
the
modality
of
that
?
this
be
unfinished
business
.
this
be
the
correct
chamber
to
raise
such
a
situation
.
it
be
important
for
the
deputy
's
constituent
to
be
aware
of
that
.
there
be
a
broad
issue
about
make
this
information
clear

family
in

the
information
should
be
make
clear
on
the

at

such
as

perhaps
the
deputy
's

be
not
aware

I
hope
he
can
bring
it
to

attention

many

find
themselves
in

whatever

because

be
deny

hear
,
hear

the
minister
speak
early
about
the
merit
of
not
use
one
-
off
funding
for
day
-
to
-
day
measure
.
I
find
it
difficult
to
disagree
with
that
.
once
-
off
funding
can
be
use
for
capital
project
.
there
be
a
dire
need
for
transport
capital
project
in
particular
.
person
look
back
at
the
Celtic
tiger
and
say
that
at
least
we
get
road
out
it
.
if
this
be
a
boom
,
what
will
we
look
back
on
and
be
able
to
say
we
get
out
of
it
?
there
be
a
necessity
for
electricity
generation
capacity
in
this
country
.
we
can
import
as
much
French
nuclear
energy
as
we
want
but
we
will
import
it
at
whatever
cost
they
want
to
sell
it
.
there
be
simply
no
alternative
to
use
car
in
Ireland
.
the
idea
that
we
will
have
1
million
car
and
the
electricity
to
provide
for
they
by
2030
be
laughable
.
while
I
do
not
have
any
problem
with
put
money
aside
,
I
just
wonder
whether
some
of
it
should
be
spend
on
once
-
off
capital
funding
now
.
I
always
read
the
minister
's
speech
at
this
point
in
this
proceedings
because
I
believe
it
be
important
.
in
most
case
,
one
come
in
here
with
a
pre-prepared
speech
but
it
be
important
to
parse
the
word
of
the
minister
and
to
seek
to
interpret
they
.
his
speech
state
:
government
be
acutely
aware
that
while
public
servant
have
FEMPI
reverse
and
be
due
to
receive
further
pay
rise
under
the
extension
to
the
current
Public
service
agreement
,
Building
Momentum
,
that
work
in
community
and
voluntary
organisation
be
not
cover
by
this
arrangement
.
nor
be
they
cover
under
any
Public
service
agreement
negotiate
between
public
service
union
and
the
government
.
that
work
in
the
Community
and
voluntary
sector
be
not
public
servant
and
so
,
the
government
do
not
...
there
be
a
lot
of
not
and
nos
there
.
however
,
one
seek
to
be
positive
in
interpret
the
minister
's
word
.
the
speech
go
on
to
say
"
I
believe
a
process
along
this
line
could
play
a
useful
role
in
provide
solution
to
the
current
pay
related
issue
that
have
be
raise
,
and
which
be
reference
in
today
's
[
Labour
]
motion
.
"
this
statement
relate
to
further
engagement
by
the
WRC
.
I
hope
that
the
minister
be
today
send
a
signal
that
there
be
potentially
grounds
for
a
"
process
"
,
to
use
the
minister
's
word
,
to
be
devise
in
which
people
could
come
around
the
table
to
begin
to
deal
with
this
anomaly
that
exist
.
in
my
area
in
Cork
,
organisation
like
Enable
Ireland
and
the
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
operate
.
I
be
proud
to
join
they
in
Charleville
recently
where
speech
and
language
therapist
,
occupational
therapist
and
other
professional
be
roll
out
government
policy
.
the
government
establish
the
child
's
disability
network
team
and
expect
organisation
like
the
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
and
enable
Ireland
to
deliver
on
that
policy
.
however
,
they
be
deliver
on
that
policy
with
one
hand
tie
behind
they
back
because
there
be
people
work
in
equivalent
grade
and
profession
,
that
be
,
speech
and
language
therapist
,
occupational
therapist
,
physiotherapist
and
so
on
,
who
be
work
in
the
HSE
and
have
good
term
and
condition
.
the
mandate
the
minister
talk
about
can
now
change
.
surely
government
policy
should
demand
that
,
if
we
be
to
roll
out
child
's
disability
network
team
and
if
that
be
a
function
of
government
policy
,
the
people
who
be
roll
they
out
should
have
equal
term
and
condition
of
employment
.
all
we
be
ask
for
today
be
for
government
to
devise
a
process
to
allow
trade
union
and
worker
's
representative
to
come
around
a
table
and
begin
the
change
we
all
acknowledge
be
need
.
the
mandate
need
to
change
and
it
be
time
for
it
to
change
so
that
there
will
be
equality
in
the
system
.
as
I
have
say
,
people
work
as
occupational
therapist
for
the
St.
Joseph's
Foundation
should
have
the
same
term
and
condition
as
people
work
in
the
HSE
.
it
be
as
simple
as
that
.
I
be
look
the
minister
straight
in
the
eye
now
and
I
hope
that
he
be
smile
because
he
government
will
come
up
with
a
process
.
that
be
all
we
be
ask
for
here
today
.
that
would
give
some
semblance
of
hope
to
the
many
people
we
be
seek
to
represent
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
and
the
clear
language
from
the
minister
in
respect
of
the
domestic
violence
provision
.
he
state
unequivocally
that
:
a
requirement
for
evidential
proof
that
a
person
have
be
victimise
could
serve
to
undermine
the
operation
of
the
legislation
.
consequently
,
for
the
initial
two
-
year
period
of
the
operation
of
the
leave
,
there
will
be
no
requirement
for
a
person
to
present
evidence
in
order
to
avail
of
the
leave
.
in
the
minister
's
response
,
he
may
tell
we
why
a
period
of
two
year
be
choose
.
it
seem
to
I
quite
a
arbitrary
period
of
time
.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
principle
apply
that
no
evidence
be
require
,
which
be
welcome
,
I
question
why
it
have
to
be
two
year
.
that
be
the
first
point
.
my
second
point
be
on
the
wait
period
of
26
week
and
the
flexibility
around
that
.
subsection
(
5
)
of
the
new
section
13b
state
:
for
the
purpose
of
this
section
,
where
a
employee
cease
to
be
the
employee
of
a
employer
and
,
not
more
than
26
week
after
the
date
of
cesser
,
the
employee
again
become
the
employee
of
the
employer
,
the
period
of
service
of
that
employee
with
that
employer
before
the
date
of
cesser
shall
be
deem
to
be
continuous
with
the
period
of
service
of
that
employee
with
that
employer
after
again
become
such
employee
.
I
be
try
to
fully
understand
what
that
mean
but
we
will
parse
it
in
the
come
week
and
certainly
before
committee
stage
.
the
minister
may
further
elucidate
that
point
.
read
the
language
of
the
Bill
,
what
come
across
to
I
be
that
there
be
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
say
"
no
"
versus
what
we
contend
be
the
requirement
to
ensure
the
employee
's
right
to
access
such
leave
be
embed
in
the
legislation
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
of
what
be
in
the
minister
's
head
and
where
he
stand
.
be
I
look
at
the
constituent
part
of
the
government
,
I
imagine
the
Green
Party
might
be
more
in
favour
of
the
rights
of
the
employee
,
whereas
Fine
Gael
and
probably
some
element
of
Fianna
Fáil
would
probably
say
there
need
to
be
great
flexibility
as
regards
the
ability
of
the
employer
to
say
"
no
"
.
I
just
want
to
get
a
sense
of
where
the
government
be
come
from
.
I
say
that
because
the
grounds
for
refusal
outline
in
section
13D
seem
very
loose
.
we
will
seek
to
amend
this
grounds
if
we
perceive
that
the
arrangement
be
too
loose
and
the
Bill
,
in
attempt
to
transpose
the
EU
legislation
,
do
not
fully
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
employee
.
why
have
a
cut
-
off
age
of
12
year
,
as
provide
for
in
section
13b
(
3
)
?
where
a
child
be
in
receipt
of
a
long
-
term
illness
payment
,
for
instance
,
he
or
she
qualify
up
to
the
age
of
16
year
.
I
respectfully
contend
that
the
age
of
12
and
16
year
be
unrealistic
and
premature
cut
-
off
point
.
we
will
seek
to
amend
that
provision
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
outline
he
perspective
on
they
.
there
be
so
many
family
in
Ireland
where
fertility
and
miscarriage
arise
.
the
silence
surround
that
be
one
of
the
hard
thing
for
family
when
they
go
through
fertility
treatment
or
where
miscarriage
arise
.
this
be
open
to
further
examination
but
I
understand
that
around
14000
woman
experience
miscarriage
each
year
and
approximately
one
in
six
couple
experience
fertility
issue
.
not
all
require
or
want
treatment
but
for
the
many
who
do
,
we
must
ensure
that
the
appropriate
workplace
leave
be
available
.
we
will
propose
some
amendment
to
meet
that
requirement
because
it
be
high
time
we
as
a
society
acknowledge
that
miscarriage
exist
.
there
be
the
beginning
of
a
great
openness
around
the
conversation
about
miscarriage
but
it
would
be
good
if
we
legislate
for
a
requirement
in
society
that
people
could
have
leave
in
that
circumstance
.
where
a
employer
be
compassionate
,
there
be
never
a
issue
around
this
matter
but
not
every
employer
be
compassionate
.
the
Bill
the
Labour
Party
publish
in
March
last
year
,
which
would
provide
20
day
'
leave
for
woman
who
experience
early
miscarriage
,
with
a
additional
ten
day
pay
time
off
for
worker
who
wish
to
access
reproductive
healthcare
treatment
such
as
ivf
,
be
a
sensible
solution
.
if
the
minister
would
respond
to
that
shortly
,
I
would
welcome
that
.
we
will
certainly
seek
to
amend
this
legislation
to
recognise
the
fact
that
people
require
leave
for
miscarriage
and
fertility
treatment
.
that
would
be
the
hallmark
of
a
progressive
society
be
we
to
do
that
.
the
minister
mention
New
Zealand
,
which
receive
global
praise
for
introduce
pay
time
off
for
people
in
the
workplace
who
experience
a
miscarriage
.
it
would
be
a
great
victory
for
woman
and
family
if
we
be
to
follow
suit
.
I
also
note
the
specific
provision
on
breast
-
feeding
which
we
fully
welcome
.
I
stand
here
as
a
man
about
to
hit
the
age
of
50
but
I
have
a
very
young
family
.
I
have
a
five
-
year
-
old
,
a
three
-
year
-
old
and
a
little
girl
who
be
bear
in
July
,
so
I
know
something
of
this
matter
.
I
note
the
minister
make
specific
reference
to
the
Green
Party
motion
tab
by
Senator
Pauline
O'Reilly
in
the
Seanad
today
propose
to
introduce
lesson
in
school
on
breast
-
feeding
.
I
would
be
far
more
satisfied
,
as
I
think
we
all
would
,
if
there
be
more
lactation
consultant
operate
throughout
the
State
.
some
€
1.58
million
be
provide
to
hire
24
lactation
consultant
.
it
be
all
well
and
good
tabling
motion
in
the
Seanad
,
and
they
be
laudable
in
they
own
right
,
but
there
be
a
responsibility
on
the
Green
Party
in
this
regard
.
while
it
do
not
control
the
health
portfolio
,
there
be
a
collective
responsibility
on
the
government
to
ensure
that
lactation
consultant
be
hire
.
that
would
have
a
massive
impact
on
family
who
need
that
advice
.
it
cost
over
€
100
for
a
private
consultant
's
advice
and
not
many
can
afford
that
.
where
there
be
issue
around
breast
-
feeding
,
it
be
very
easy
for
people
to
become
discourage
if
they
do
not
have
access
to
a
public
healthcare
service
which
do
not
have
the
require
24
consultant
.
it
be
government
policy
to
roll
out
that
24
lactation
consultant
position
at
a
cost
of
€
1.58
million
.
it
be
incumbent
on
the
Green
Party
,
Fine
Gael
and
Fianna
Fáil
to
make
sure
they
do
everything
to
recruit
that
consultant
into
the
system
.
that
issue
be
pertinent
to
this
Bill
.
I
will
leave
it
there
.
I
have
raise
specific
issue
around
the
rights
of
the
employee
versus
the
flexibility
that
I
read
across
this
legislation
in
the
tone
of
its
language
,
which
seem
to
I
to
tilt
the
balance
of
power
towards
the
employer
.
that
need
to
be
address
.

12
and

have
be

.
the
Taoiseach
might
address
the
deputy
's
question
.
I
again
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
the
matter
.
I
will
bring
he
concern
and
view
back
to
the
minister
.
as
I
outline
,
it
be
important
any
decision
make
with
regard
to
seasonal
clock
change
take
account
of
the
wide
impact
this
change
would
make
.
the
Department
of
Justice
's
engagement
with
the
public
have
show
the
people
be
keenly
aware
of
this
impact
.
the
government
have
introduce
a
number
of
target
measure
in
budget
2023
to
increase
energy
efficiency
,
such
as
increase
the
funding
to
the
good
energy
,
warm
home
scheme
.
this
will
allow
homeowner
on
low
income
to
upgrade
the
energy
efficiency
of
they
home
.
the
small
firm
investment
in
energy
efficiency
scheme
will
provide
a
grant
to
company
to
encourage
capital
investment
in
project
to
reduce
carbon
emission
.
the
€600
energy
credit
for
household
and
the
temporary
business
energy
support
scheme
will
also
assist
in
reduce
the
impact
of
the
increase
cost
of
energy
.
the
Department
of
Justice
will
continue
to
engage
at
EU
level
on
the
issue
of
seasonal
clock
change
and
ensure
Ireland
's
interest
be
take
into
account
throughout
the
decision
-
making
process
.
the
deputy
be
right
to
say
we
need
to
conserve
energy
.
his
proposal
sound
very
reasonable
to
I
.
if
all
the
country
in
Europe
,
the
UK
and
the
island
of
Ireland
be
to
jump
together
,
we
would
have
a
good
chance
.
the
war
in
Ukraine
have
bring
huge
challenge
.
I
will
not
say
huge
opportunity
but
there
be
area
where
we
can
try
to
conserve
energy
.
it
be
vital
.
I
be
watch
the
EirGrid
dashboard
every
day
.
as
a
politician
,
one
hope
the
wind
blow
as
much
as
possible
and
that
it
remain
relatively
mild
,
but
there
be
challenging
time
ahead
.
I
commend
the
Acting
chairman
on
she
running
of
proceedings
and
keep
we
all
on
time
.
I
support
the
motion
and
be
glad
it
have
be
tab
by
the
social
Democrat
.
I
note
the
motion
put
forward
by
that
party
on
24
February
2021
,
to
which
the
Labour
Party
tab
a
amendment
relate
to
medical
card
.
the
amendment
be
accept
and
the
motion
,
as
amend
,
agree
to
by
the
House
.
the
amendment
call
on
the
government
to
issue
a
enhance
medical
card
to
all
survivor
who
present
to
mother
and
baby
home
for
any
length
of
time
,
include
while
pregnant
or
on
a
post-natal
basis
.
that
motion
have
be
pass
by
the
Dáil
.
with
the
announcement
of
the
scheme
,
there
now
seem
to
be
a
rowing
back
on
that
democratic
position
that
be
take
.
in
the
context
of
the
publication
of
the
question
and
answer
document
relate
to
the
mother
and
baby
institution
payment
scheme
,
it
be
important
that
we
convey
to
people
that
the
scheme
be
not
up
and
run
and
that
it
require
the
mother
and
Baby
Institution
payment
Scheme
Bill
2022
to
be
pass
before
it
come
into
operation
.
many
deputy
be
be
contact
by
people
who
think
the
scheme
be
up
and
run
and
it
be
important
that
a
message
go
out
to
clarify
that
it
be
not
yet
in
operation
.
the
publication
of
the
question
and
answer
paper
have
give
the
impression
that
the
scheme
be
in
place
.
there
be
a
need
to
clarify
for
the
public
,
especially
survivor
,
that
it
be
not
yet
in
existence
.
like
everybody
else
,
I
be
perplexed
as
to
why
there
be
such
a
arbitrary
cut
-
off
point
with
regard
to
baby
below
six
month
of
age
.
I
can
only
surmise
that
the
minister
and
the
Department
have
put
some
quantifiable
monetary
value
on
the
cost
of
compensation
or
redress
that
would
significantly
increase
the
overall
cost
beyond
€
800
million
that
be
allocate
.
I
can
think
of
no
other
reason
the
government
would
act
in
such
a
arbitrary
way
in
respect
of
baby
aged
less
than
six
month
.
the
minister
state
:
the
commission
recommend
a
scheme
in
which
6500
people
would
benefit
,
at
a
total
cost
of
€400
million
.
we
have
go
substantially
beyond
that
.
the
proposal
contain
in
the
State
scheme
will
benefit
34000
people
,
at
a
total
cost
of
€800
million
.
some
19000
former
resident
will
receive
enhance
medical
card
.
if
I
be
interpret
the
scheme
correctly
-
I
be
open
to
correction
in
that
regard
-
the
minister
be
say
that
for
mother
who
spend
less
than
three
month
in
a
mother
and
baby
home
or
a
county
home
institution
it
be
€
5000
,
for
mother
who
spend
between
three
and
six
month
it
be
€
10000
,
and
there
be
then
a
€
1500
work
payment
for
mother
who
qualify
in
that
regard
.
that
mean
the
total
amount
for
that
who
qualify
for
the
general
payment
and
the
work
payment
be
€
11500
.
what
I
be
try
to
convey
,
possibly
awkwardly
,
be
that
I
do
not
understand
the
quantum
for
baby
between
birth
and
six
month
and
whether
there
be
a
value
put
on
that
.
when
I
say
"
value
"
,
I
be
ask
whether
the
government
kick
the
tyre
from
a
financial
perspective
when
it
be
do
the
financial
calculation
and
come
up
with
a
figure
of
€
800
million
.
how
much
extra
would
it
have
cost
the
State
to
include
baby
between
birth
and
six
month
?
I
be
not
a
accountant
and
I
do
not
want
to
sound
like
one
.
ultimately
,
the
point
I
be
make
be
that
the
fact
that
a
person
spend
a
period
in
one
of
this
institution
should
,
morally
and
ethically
,
be
sufficient
for
the
person
to
,
at
least
,
be
give
some
recognition
by
way
of
redress
for
that
period
.
the
minister
will
present
he
Bill
in
the
week
of
26
October
.
there
be
still
a
sword
of
Damocles
hang
over
we
in
the
context
of
the
testimony
of
people
who
present
to
the
confidential
committee
.
respectfully
,
that
have
not
yet
be
fully
address
by
the
minister
.
he
have
state
previously
that
he
be
go
to
create
a
archive
but
it
add
insult
to
injury
if
people
who
have
present
to
the
confidential
committee
be
now
be
tell
that
testimony
will
be
archive
and
house
elsewhere
.
there
must
be
all
sort
of
difficulty
in
respect
of
the
general
datum
protection
regulation
,
gdpr
,
and
the
ethics
or
lack
of
ethics
when
it
come
to
take
all
of
that
information
and
put
it
into
a
archive
without
go
back
to
each
person
who
present
to
that
confidential
committee
.
they
rightly
feel
aggrieved
that
they
testimony
be
not
treat
with
the
respect
it
deserve
.
there
be
issue
in
that
regard
that
still
need
to
be
deal
with
in
the
context
of
the
Bill
that
will
be
bring
before
we
.
I
suspect
that
much
play
will
make
by
member
of
the
Opposition
in
respect
of
that
issue
because
we
cannot
hive
it
off
;
we
need
to
deal
with
it
face
on
.
we
in
opposition
have
consistently
say
that
we
generation
of
politician
need
to
deal
with
this
issue
as
comprehensively
as
possible
.
it
be
one
of
the
issue
that
must
be
address
.
the
issue
of
GSK
,
formerly
GlaxoSmithKline
,
have
not
yet
be
put
to
bed
either
.
Dare
I
deign
to
give
the
minister
advice
on
what
he
should
do
?
if
I
be
in
he
position
,
I
would
call
in
GSK
and
tell
the
company
that
it
need
to
do
more
than
apologise
.
I
refer
to
the
lack
of
ethics
show
.
this
company
still
exist
and
all
it
have
do
be
give
a
apology
.
there
would
be
a
moral
obligation
and
responsibility
on
any
pharmaceutical
company
to
deal
with
a
issue
such
as
this
.
in
the
context
of
the
vaccine
trial
alone
,
there
also
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
accountability
and
culpability
from
the
religious
institution
.
I
be
repeat
point
that
have
be
well
make
to
the
minister
.
he
will
be
acutely
aware
of
all
this
and
I
know
he
will
have
internalise
all
of
this
complexity
in
he
own
thinking
on
the
Bill
that
will
come
before
we
.
however
,
I
ask
he
not
to
forget
that
there
be
a
moral
obligation
on
company
such
as
GSK
,
particularly
where
they
be
IDA
Ireland
client
and
have
be
the
beneficiary
of
significant
support
from
the
State
through
the
year
.
they
have
a
moral
obligation
and
there
be
leverage
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
be
able
to
flex
its
muscle
in
that
regard
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
motion
wholeheartedly
and
thanks
the
social
Democrat
-
I
nearly
say
"
the
Progressive
Democrat
"
-
for
bring
it
forward
.
there
be
ten
minute
leave
and
member
will
have
one
minute
each
.
I
call
deputy
Cathal
Crowe
.
my
sincere
apology
.
I
be
out
of
order
myself
.
there
be
very
little
time
leave
in
this
slot
.
please
,
forgive
I
.
I
apologise
.
if
I
may
,
as
acting
chair
,
intervene
at
this
point
in
time
.
there
be
a
long
-
standing
convention
in
the
House
as
I
understand
it
.
this
agenda
item
be
statement
on
the
European
Council
meeting
of
October
20
and
21
pursuant
to
standing
order
124
.
I
ask
all
member
present
to
confine
they
remark
to
this
particular
topic
.
it
do
not
help
the
House
if
member
be
barrack
each
other
.
it
serve
no
purpose
whatsoever
.
if
we
could
have
more
light
than
heat
in
the
debate
,
it
would
be
helpful
for
everybody
.
I
welcome
the
Georgian

Mr.
Jonathan
Tobin
,
from
Youghal
,
County
Cork
,
be
currently
in
hospital
in
Greece
.
he
have
a
catastrophic
accident
on
29
July
last
.
his
family
now
want
to
bring
he
home
.
the
HSE
be
liais
with
he
family
,
and
both
Cork
University
Hospital
and
the
hospital
in
Greece
be
liais
with
each
other
.
we
be
now
try
to
get
the
HSE
to
use
its
discretion
under
the
treatment
abroad
scheme
to
get
a
air
ambulance
to
bring
he
home
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
please
intercede
with
the
HSE
to
bring
the
man
home
if
possible
.
I
welcome
that
the
government
will
not
oppose
this
Bill
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
minister
have
issue
with
some
of
the
way
the
legislation
be
lay
out
,
but
this
be
why
we
have
pre-legislative
scrutiny
;
it
be
there
to
iron
all
of
this
out
.
as
the
Opposition
,
we
do
not
have
the
service
of
the
Attorney
General
.
we
would
love
to
have
the
service
of
the
Attorney
General
when
draft
legislation
.
maybe
in
the
come
year
we
will
have
the
opportunity
ourselves
over
this
side
of
the
House
to
have
that
service
.
I
acknowledge
also
that
the
government
will
bring
forward
legislation
,
which
be
also
welcome
,
but
we
want
to
see
it
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
hope
the
commitment
to
publish
it
by
the
end
of
2022
be
meet
.
as
well
as
legislation
,
we
need
to
have
the
resource
in
we
community
so
we
can
combat
this
issue
to
begin
with
.
deputy
Paul
Donnelly
refer
to
small
classroom
in
DEIS
area
and
other
area
.
we
also
need
to
make
sure
that
we
fully
resource
we
drug
and
alcohol
task
force
.
I
be
a
director
of
the
Clondalkin
drug
and
alcohol
task
force
for
many
year
.
early
we
talk
about
crack
cocaine
.
there
be
so
many
time
we
have
chance
to
be
reactive
in
we
community
.
when
we
see
a
emerge
need
in
we
community
,
for
example
,
and
want
to
put
a
policy
or
measure
in
place
to
deal
with
that
,
we
could
not
because
we
do
not
have
the
resource
.
we
need
to
make
sure
that
we
have
the
resource
in
place
for
we
community
.
I
thank
all
deputy
for
a
lively
and
heartening
debate
.
powerful
contribution
be
make
on
this
side
of
the
House
.
this
be
honest
and
passionate
contribution
.
it
be
exactly
what
be
need
.
I
echo
the
call
for
a
citizen
's
assembly
on
drug
.
it
be
time
for
a
adult
conversation
.
we
talk
about
the
language
we
use
on
a
daily
basis
such
as
"
get
out
of
the
head
"
.
what
do
that
mean
?
it
mean
that
people
want
to
get
out
of
the
space
that
be
go
on
in
they
head
.
they
want
to
use
a
illicit
substance
.
they
want
to
do
something
that
will
take
they
away
from
themselves
.
that
be
what
drug
use
do
and
that
be
what
addiction
do
.
it
give
calm
to
that
anxious
inner
world
that
be
go
on
.
it
give
calm
to
the
underlying
reason
we
speak
about
of
trauma
poverty
.
that
be
what
it
do
.
we
need
to
tackle
the
underlying
reason
and
issue
.
I
have
work
in
many
drug
service
over
the
year
.
that
be
my
background
before
I
come
into
this
Chamber
.
one
of
the
place
that
stick
with
I
for
year
be
one
of
the
most
challenging
but
also
one
of
the
most
rewarding
.
it
be
a
role
I
have
when
I
be
work
with
under
18
-
year
-
old
in
a
area
of
Dublin
.
I
will
not
mention
the
specific
area
because
I
do
not
want
to
further
stigmatise
it
.
I
welcome
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
into
the
project
when
he
be
a
minister
of
State
at
the
time
with
responsibility
for
the
national
drug
strategy
.
we
be
work
with
under
18s
.
if
I
have
say
to
that
young
lad
that
they
be
vulnerable
,
they
would
go
through
I
for
a
shortcut
.
that
be
the
last
thing
they
think
they
be
,
but
they
be
vulnerable
.
I
see
this
young
lad
and
work
with
they
.
I
helplessly
and
hopelessly
try
to
help
this
young
lad
.
I
could
see
in
front
of
my
eye
how
they
be
be
entice
into
criminality
by
old
and
more
experienced
drug
dealer
who
tell
they
,
"
hold
this
drug
for
we
and
whatever
drug
the
lad
be
use
you
will
get
you
touch
out
of
that
.
"
all
of
a
sudden
the
local
gardaí
would
get
a
call
and
this
young
kid
would
be
the
pawn
among
criminal
kingmaker
.
they
would
let
gardaí
know
that
this
kid
have
the
drug
,
maybe
just
to
get
themselves
off
the
hook
.
that
be
well
know
right
across
Dublin
.
this
young
kid
be
out
of
school
and
they
be
not
engage
in
employment
.
they
be
not
engage
in
anything
other
than
the
drug
they
be
use
and
the
drug
dealer
.
we
need
to
have
resource
in
place
so
we
can
tackle
that
.
I
be
a
individual
and
on
my
own
and
work
with
this
under
18s
.
that
be
my
role
.
I
be
on
my
own
try
to
deal
with
this
young
lad
.
we
see
some
good
outcome
but
we
also
see
some
not
so
good
outcome
.
unfortunately
,
we
lose
some
young
people
.
we
need
to
examine
the
underlying
issue
that
contribute
towards
make
this
lifestyle
look
attractive
.
again
,
it
be
a
escape
.
it
be
the
calm
in
a
anxious
world
.
get
out
of
the
head
be
a
escape
from
reality
that
this
young
people
be
in
.
Poverty
and
the
lack
of
opportunity
be
always
top
of
the
list
in
any
conversation
I
have
,
not
only
with
young
people
but
also
with
the
service
that
be
there
to
support
they
.
reference
be
always
make
to
intergenerational
drug
user
.
it
be
not
about
intergenerational
drug
use
;
it
be
about
intergenerational
poverty
and
trauma
that
we
deal
with
on
a
daily
basis
.
we
need
to
target
this
young
people
before
they
end
up
in
the
hand
of
drug
dealer
.
I
have
always
believe
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
lose
cause
.
I
have
work
with
people
right
across
the
spectrum
of
drug
use
over
the
year
.
some
of
they
have
have
chaotic
lifestyle
,
some
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
and
have
year
of
abstain
behind
they
,
and
everybody
in
between
.
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
lose
cause
.
we
use
to
have
to
work
on
logic
model
and
,
to
get
the
resource
for
the
drug
task
force
from
the
minister
,
we
have
to
do
tick
-
box
exercise
and
quantify
what
be
a
success
.
a
success
to
I
a
awful
lot
of
the
time
be
when
somebody
turn
up
the
next
morning
because
,
sometimes
when
they
be
leave
my
service
,
I
do
not
believe
they
would
get
through
the
night
.
it
be
hard
to
quantify
that
when
fill
out
hse
form
,
tick
box
,
work
on
logic
model
and
all
the
hoop
they
make
we
jump
through
.
the
child
be
vulnerable
in
this
,
as
be
the
drug
user
.
we
need
a
more
productive
way
of
deal
with
drug
user
.
direct
they
away
from
the
Judiciary
service
and
into
healthcare
and
recovery
service
have
to
be
the
way
forward
.
it
be
say
at
the
start
by
other
Deputy
,
probably
a
lot
good
than
I
be
say
it
,
that
the
citizen

assembly
on

be
a
way
forward
on

I
thank

for

I
acknowledge
that

I
hope
it
get
to
the
stage

I
look

to
see
what
the

I
ask
the

please
finish
because

last
night
,
as
I
be
sit
in
my
office
,
I
try
to
crystallise
my
thought
around
this
debate
.
there
be
so
much
information
for
we
to
analyse
that
it
be
hard
to
encapsulate
it
within
a
reasonably
short
debate
such
as
this
.
nonetheless
,
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
speak
in
the
debate
.
we
be
fortunate
as
deputy
that
there
be
many
people
outside
this
chamber
who
be
willing
to
provide
we
with
excellent
research
and
resource
.
as
I
sit
in
my
office
last
night
,
I
receive
a
email
contain
a
briefing
paper
on
the
Bill
from
the
Irish
Council
for
Civil
liberty
,
ICCL
.
with
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
permission
,
I
will
read
some
of
it
into
the
record
.
for
I
,
it
crystallise
all
the
issue
and
flaw
that
be
inherent
in
this
legislation
.
the
ICCL
paper
state
at
the
outset
:
1
.
survivor
challenge
the
final
report
of
the
mother
and
Baby
Home
Commission
of
investigation
in
the
high
Court
by
argue
that
the
commission
fail
to
adhere
to
the
legislation
that
establish
it
,
and
that
they
rights
under
the
constitution
and
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
have
be
breach
.
a
settlement
be
reach
whereby
the
State
consent
to
a
declaration
that
the
commission
act
in
breach
of
statutory
duty
.
a
statement
be
also
agree
which
recognise
that
"
survivor
do
not
accept
the
account
give
in
the
final
report
...
as
a
true
and
full
reflection
of
the
oral
and
documentary
evidence
they
give
"
.
this
be
follow
by
a
list
of
64
paragraph
which
can
no
long
be
rely
on
.
the
State
have
express
that
the
Redress
Scheme
be
a
part
of
the
measure
be
use
in
"
respond
to
the
report
"
.
ICCL
be
concerned
that
the
Redress
Scheme
be
therefore
base
on
a
report
which
the
State
itself
agree
be
flawed
.
2
.
the
final
report
omit
survivor
's
testimony
and
draw
conclusion
that
do
not
align
with
survivor
's
testimony
.
for
example
:
a
)
there
be
"
no
evidence
"
that
the
woman
who
give
birth
be
deny
pain
relief
(
executive
summary
,
para
.
245
)
and
that
there
be
"
no
evidence
"
[
this
be
the
word
of
the
commission
report
]
that
at
the
time
of
adoption
woman
think
"
they
consent
be
not
full
,
free
and
inform
"
(
executive
summary
,
para
.
254
)
.
b)
mother
"
be
not
'
incarcerate
'
in
the
strict
meaning
of
the
word
"
c
)
certain
evidence
be
"
merely
the
product
of
a
creative
writing
class
"
.
this
be
the
atmosphere
in
which
we
be
seek
to
promulgate
this
legislation
.
the
ICCL
's
report
be
a
damning
one
.
on
the
propose
independent
review
,
it
state
:
on
2
June
2021
,
it
be
report
that
the
vast
majority
of
evidence
give
by
survivor
,
that
who
give
evidence
to
the
confidential
Committee
,
be
effectively
not
consider
for
the
final
report
.
this
lead
to
the
proposal
from
the
Department
of
Children
of
a
review
of
survivor
testimony
.
however
,
[
the
minister
]
recently
announce
[
and
this
be
quote
in
the
Irish
Examiner
,
thanks
to
the
work
of
Elaine
Loughlin
and
Conall
Ó
Fátharta
]
that
this
would
not
proceed
due
to
"
significant
legal
complexity
"
.
this
have
not
be
adequately
identify
.
problem
with
the
mother
and
Baby
Institution
payment
Scheme
Bill
2022
4
.
[
the
Bill
]
omit
over
40
%
of
survivor
,
include
child
who
spend
less
than
six
month
in
a
institution
and
that
who
be
board
out
.
the
six
-
month
requirement
be
arbitrary
and
permit
no
consideration
of
context
:
a
child
resident
for
180
day
receive
€
12500
.
a
child
resident
for
179
day
receive
...
[
nothing
at
all
]
.
5
.
the
Bill
make
it
more
difficult
for
survivor
who
reside
in
a
institution
at
a
young
age
to
claim
compensation
.
whereas
the
General
Scheme
of
the
Bill
[
which
the
committee
consider
]
allow
child
survivor
to
claim
a
payment
if
they
be
,
or
have
reasonable
grounds
for
suspect
they
be
,
resident
...
the
Bill
only
allow
a
child
to
claim
who
"
be
resident
"
[
very
specific
language
]
...
for
child
who
may
have
no
documentary
evidence
of
they
residence
,
this
set
the
standard
of
proof
too
high
.
6
.
the
Bill
provide
no
compensation
for
force
and
illegal
adoption
,
force
labour
,
unlawful
vaccine
trial
...
deputy
Funchion
have
refer
to
the
vaccine
trial
that
take
place
,
a
issue
that
have
be
raise
by
all
Opposition
Member
.
we
want
clarity
in
respect
of
GSK
.
we
have
be
very
adamant
about
that
.
it
look
to
I
like
GSK
have
be
let
off
the
hook
.
respectfully
,
the
Minister
and
the
State
have
not
adequately
address
the
issue
of
the
vaccine
trial
.
it
be
a
sword
of
Damocles
hang
over
we
and
it
need
to
be
address
.
6
.
the
Bill
provide
no
compensation
for
force
and
illegal
adoption
,
force
labour
,
unlawful
vaccine
trial
,
abuse
as
a
adopt
child
,
and
death
.
nor
do
the
Bill
provide
compensation
for
discrimination
whether
base
on
gender
,
disability
or
race
.
the
latter
issue
of
systemic
racism
in
institution
be
recently
highlight
as
a
serious
gap
in
this
Bill
by
UN
special
Rapporteurs
.
7
.
the
term
"
work
-
related
payment
"
use
by
the
Bill
...
do
not
adequately
describe
live
experience
.
it
should
properly
be
describe
as
"
force
labour
"
.
8
.
the
level
of
payment
provide
by
the
Bill
in
respect
of
the
"
work
-
related
payment
"
be
inadequate
.
they
must
correspond
to
the
wage
that
survivor
should
have
earn
at
the
time
and
be
link
to
the
average
industrial
wage
.
9
.
the
Bill
do
not
count
a
"
temporary
absence
"
of
180
day
or
more
...
there
be
no
room
for
context
.
a
survivor
may
have
excellent
reason
for
have
leave
the
institution
and
return
.
for
example
,
a
survivor
may
have
escape
for
181
day
before
be
catch
and
return
.
that
period
of
181
day
could
not
reasonably
be
separate
from
they
time
in
the
institution
.
this
be
the
language
we
be
deal
with
.
this
be
the
context
in
which
the
Bill
be
be
put
before
we
.
this
be
how
serious
it
be
.
10
.
the
enhance
medical
card
propose
in
the
General
Scheme
have
be
replace
by
health
service
without
charge
and
be
available
for
anyone
resident
for
180
day
...
this
residency
requirement
be
arbitrary
and
should
be
remove
.
we
be
all
ad
idem
in
the
Opposition
on
that
point
.
the
timeframe
of
zero
to
six
month
be
just
too
arbitrary
.
11
.
survivor
resident
outside
of
Ireland
be
entitle
to
a
payment
of
€3000
instead
of
health
service
without
charge
...
this
figure
be
far
too
low
and
be
not
reflective
of
the
value
of
the
service
available
to
that
receive
health
service
without
charge
.
12
.
survivor
have
call
specifically
for
trauma
-
inform
counselling
and
therapy
.
this
be
not
provide
for
in
the
Bill
.
13
.
there
be
no
requirement
in
the
Bill
that
that
charge
to
administer
the
Redress
scheme
must
be
qualify
for
the
position
and
be
subject
to
ongoing
training
in
international
human
rights
law
and
trauma
-
inform
response
to
gross
human
rights
violation
.
the
minister
say
this
legislation
be
ground
in
human
rights
law
.
that
be
open
to
interpretation
and
critique
.
the
idea
of
put
decide
officer
within
the
Department
itself
be
something
we
will
deal
with
on
committee
stage
because
it
require
further
interrogation
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
be
not
convinced
it
be
the
right
way
to
go
.
17
.
additionally
,
the
Bill
state
that
a
survivor
will
be
entitle
to
no
compensation
where
they
have
"
receive
a
award
from
a
court
or
settlement
in
respect
of
a
action
arise
out
of
any
circumstance
relate
to
the
same
period
of
residence
in
the
institution
"
...
this
provision
do
not
take
into
account
the
possibility
of
a
court
awarding
a
survivor
a
low
amount
of
compensation
than
they
would
receive
under
the
Bill
.
moreover
,
court
proceedings
may
not
necessarily
be
direct
towards
the
State
,
yet
the
Bill
preclude
such
a
individual
from
late
claim
compensation
from
the
State
.
again
,
this
be
a
serious
flaw
in
the
Bill
and
we
will
seek
to
amend
it
.
I
anticipate
,
however
,
that
we
amendment
will
be
rule
out
of
order
because
of
the
rule
that
apply
in
regard
to
such
amendment
.
we
ask
the
minister
to
reconsider
that
very
provision
in
section
27
of
the
Bill
,
paragraph
3
.
I
contend
that
will
have
to
be
deal
with
.
payment
rate
under
head
11
should
be
amend
to
remedy
the
failure
to
offer
payment
to
all
survivor
and
to
compensate
adequately
that
who
receive
payment
in
line
with
,
inter
alia
,
the
current
personal
injury
guideline
and
other
comparable
scheme
.
this
include
ptsd
payment
.
under
the
guideline
moderate
ptsd
equate
to
compensation
of
between
€
10000
and
€
35000
whereas
serious
ptsd
equate
to
€
35000
to
€
80000
.
the
Bill
do
not
require
that
free
legal
aid
be
make
available
to
all
applicant
in
circumstance
where
legal
aid
be
likely
to
be
require
in
apply
for
compensation
,
review
or
appealing
a
determination
and
in
swear
a
affidavit
that
could
be
require
of
they
.
this
should
be
provide
for
.
that
be
the
position
of
the
Irish
Council
of
Civil
liberty
on
this
Bill
,
all
of
which
I
agree
with
.
it
be
a
perfect
crystallisation
of
the
issue
that
we
be
deal
with
here
.
in
regard
to
we
attempt
to
amend
the
Bill
to
reflect
the
thought
and
aspiration
of
the
many
people
who
have
be
in
contact
with
we
we
will
now
seek
to
put
forward
a
amendment
in
regard
to
seek
a
report
on
the
operation
of
the
scheme
.
in
put
forward
that
amendment
we
will
seek
to
highlight
the
flaw
in
this
Bill
on
the
basis
that
we
will
seek
the
report
ask
whether
and
to
what
extent
person
engage
in
the
management
,
administration
or
operation
of
relevant
institution
should
be
permit
or
require
to
contribute
to
the
cost
of
make
payment
under
this
act
because
that
highlight
the
flaw
in
regard
to
party
which
be
not
party
to
the
redress
scheme
,
and
again
GSK
loom
large
in
we
thinking
there
;
whether
the
180
day
's
residence
requirement
provide
for
in
section
13
(
1
)
and
section
13
(
4
)
should
be
amend
or
repeal
;
whether
the
scheme
should
be
extend
to
make
provision
for
recognise
person
who
be
board
out
as
child
,
as
relevant
person
;
whether
there
be
a
need
to
provide
for
additional
institution
in
schedule
1
of
the
Bill
,
because
we
feel
it
be
not
a
all
-
encompass
Bill
in
that
regard
;
and
whether
the
requirement
impose
on
applicant
by
section
27
(
3
)
should
be
remove
.
section
27(
3
)
say
:
"
a
applicant
who
receive
a
payment
under
subsection
1
(
a
)
or
the
personal
representative
of
a
person
in
respect
of
whom
a
payment
be
make
under
subsection
1
shall
not
institute
civil
proceedings
and
shall
discontinue
any
other
proceedings
institute
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
applicant
against
a
public
body
that
arise
out
of
the
same
or
substantially
the
same
circumstance
as
the
circumstance
to
which
the
application
concern
related
.
"
that
be
basically
say
that
if
you
get
money
under
this
scheme
you
have
no
recourse
to
any
other
;
that
in
order
to
sign
the
bottom
line
to
get
you
money
,
redress
and
compensation
you
be
disbarr
yourself
from
any
further
action
on
the
same
issue
.
that
be
essentially
what
,
as
I
understand
it
,
the
minister
be
say
and
have
prescribe
in
this
legislation
.
the
Irish
Council
of
Civil
liberty
,
as
I
have
already
say
,
be
speak
to
this
point
.
a
number
of
solicitor
have
be
in
touch
with
we
who
be
concerned
about
the
perception
that
this
Bill
create
,
that
people
will
not
have
access
to
the
legal
advice
to
which
every
citizen
be
entitle
on
any
matter
of
law
before
they
,
particularly
in
circumstance
such
as
this
where
people
will
need
advocate
.
as
deputy
we
will
act
as
advocate
for
people
.
however
,
I
be
not
a
lawyer
.
there
will
be
time
when
people
will
want
to
interface
and
may
seek
to
take
further
action
,
as
I
think
should
be
they
right
,
in
civil
proceedings
.
they
should
not
be
proscribe
from
do
that
.
I
will
speak
specifically
to
the
human
rights
element
of
this
in
regard
to
the
Irish
human
Right
and
Equality
Commission
,
IHREC
.
the
minister
speak
to
the
fact
that
he
take
on
board
,
if
I
be
interpret
he
correctly
,
the
paper
that
be
publish
by
the
IHREC
.
I
will
quote
again
from
the
IHREC
.
its
advisory
paper
state
:
"
the
Commission
of
investigation
report
be
limit
in
term
of
the
institution
"
that
it
cover
.
I
have
say
that
already
.
in
the
past
,
the
exclusion
of
certain
institution
in
Ireland
have
create
a
barrier
to
seek
recourse
to
any
meaningful
reparation
for
survivor
,
despite
have
be
subject
to
serious
harm
.
the
paper
continue
:
Recent
research
from
Queen
's
University
identify
the
difficulty
of
rely
on
previous
investigation
to
inform
the
scope
of
reparation
's
scheme
and
which
result
in
exclude
certain
institution
:
''
refuse
redress
for
this
victim
or
base
redress
on
the
same
assumption
and
availability
of
evidence
already
collect
through
investigation
,
create
a
hierarchy
of
victim
,
silence
that
at
other
institution
and
compromise
the
efficacy
…
of
the
redress
scheme
overall
.
''
that
be
a
glaring
point
that
have
not
be
address
in
this
Bill
.
we
cannot
have
that
hierarchy
.
for
too
long
on
this
island
there
have
be
a
hierarchy
of
victim
.
we
can
have
no
more
of
that
,
I
respectfully
contend
.
Mr.
Spicer
,
a
solicitor
who
correspond
with
we
,
state
that
the
minister
quite
worryingly
seem
to
indicate
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
have
the
staff
in
he
own
Department
handle
the
many
thousand
of
inquiry
.
this
be
not
only
impractical
in
term
of
the
logistical
capability
of
have
a
handful
of
staff
handle
ten
of
thousand
of
call
.
it
lack
basic
independence
and
it
would
be
entirely
inappropriate
for
the
minister
's
own
staff
to
be
advise
service
user
on
they
rights
,
comment
on
whether
they
should
apply
to
the
scheme
,
help
we
community
to
weigh
up
the
pro
and
con
of
the
scheme
or
anything
else
that
the
community
need
help
with
in
term
of
put
they
application
together
.
give
the
experience
of
survivor
in
regard
to
the
commission
's
report
,
that
people
,
who
we
represent
,
be
now
expect
to
interface
with
the
minister
's
Department
and
to
have
confidence
in
that
process
.
they
do
not
have
confidence
.
they
want
to
be
able
to
deal
with
somebody
who
be
verifiably
independent
.
Mr.
Spicer
continue
to
state
that
the
community
cannot
be
lead
with
they
hand
hold
by
the
State
to
accept
this
redress
without
independent
legal
advice
form
part
of
the
decision
-
making
process
should
the
applicant
so
wish
.
this
scheme
have
to
operate
with
complete
transparency
and
fairness
.
part
of
that
process
be
the
right
to
consult
with
a
choose
and
trust
legal
representative
not
only
on
the
scheme
itself
but
also
in
consideration
of
the
individual
's
own
live
experience
and
balancing
that
with
the
provision
in
the
scheme
.
applicant
therefore
must
feel
that
they
can
voice
they
concern
and
be
give
feedback
in
a
confidential
setting
with
they
trust
legal
representative
.
I
understand
the
minister
's
genuine
attempt
to
formulate
a
scheme
here
but
the
legislation
before
we
as
it
be
constitute
do
not
deal
adequately
with
a
whole
raft
of
issue
that
remain
outstanding
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
be
of
a
mind
to
introduce
amendment
to
he
own
legislation
on
committee
stage
which
would
deal
particularly
with
section
27
and
section
3
in
regard
to
the
right
to
further
civil
proceedings
if
a
applicant
so
wish
,
where
they
be
deem
to
have
already
receive
compensation
or
redress
.
I
also
believe
strongly
that
if
the
issue
of
the
zero
to
six
month
be
not
deal
with
then
the
legislation
disregard
so
many
people
.
previously
I
ask
of
the
minister
,
on
the
record
of
the
House
,
what
analysis
have
the
minister
and
he
Department
official
do
on
the
number
of
people
in
the
zero
and
six
month
group
who
could
potentially
form
part
of
this
scheme
and
whether
that
be
quantifiable
.
if
it
be
,
what
would
the
additional
cost
of
that
have
be
to
the
scheme
?
there
have
be
a
weight
of
evidence
give
to
we
on
this
already
,
which
the
minister
will
be
well
aware
of
.
it
be
too
arbitrary
to
exclude
from
the
scheme
people
who
be
resident
for
less
than
six
month
.
again
,
I
be
respectfully
ask
the
minister
to
please
reconsider
that
.
it
seem
that
the
reason
for
it
be
that
perhaps
some
analysis
have
be
do
on
the
cost
of
this
and
it
be
such
that
the
government
decide
it
would
be
too
costly
to
add
that
onto
the
€
800
million
budget
line
that
have
already
be
assign
to
this
.
therefore
,
it
have
take
a
arbitrary
decision
.
we
will
revisit
many
of
this
issue
on
committee
stage
.
in
accordance
with
standing
order
80
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
in
two
week
.
as
far
back
as
July
2016
we
former
colleague
,
Willie
Penrose
,
publish
a
Bill
to
amend
the
constitution
to
ensure
public
ownership
of
we
public
utility
.
this
would
have
cover
not
just
we
public
water
supply
and
wastewater
treatment
infrastructure
but
also
we
gas
and
electricity
transmission
network
.
seven
year
on
,
we
be
no
close
to
see
such
a
referendum
be
propose
.
it
have
always
be
we
position
that
we
water
infrastructure
should
remain
in
public
ownership
.
it
be
most
important
to
note
that
there
be
never
any
proposal
to
privatise
it
despite
a
lot
of
rhetoric
on
the
issue
.
water
be
a
public
good
that
ought
to
be
accessible
and
State
-
run
in
perpetuity
to
ensure
the
State
be
resilient
in
the
event
of
any
crisis
in
supply
or
distribution
.
with
respect
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
I
have
hear
nothing
about
a
referendum
.
the
wording
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
be
not
specific
as
to
when
the
referendum
would
take
place
.
we
need
a
specific
date
and
time
or
some
timeline
to
ensure
the
referendum
take
place
.
it
be
vitally
important
to
maintain
public
confidence
by
ensure
it
be
retain
in
State
ownership
.
I
will
address
the
quality
of
supply
in
the
Cork
region
.
I
will
name
place
such
as
Inchigeelagh
,
Ballycotton
,
Castletownshend
,
Whitegate
,
Aghada
,
Mitchelstown
,
Rathcormack
,
Kinsale
and
Clonakilty
from
where
raw
sewage
be
go
into
the
sea
.
there
be
continuous
boil
water
notice
in
place
such
as
Aghada
and
Whitegate
,
as
there
be
in
the
little
enclave
of
Killavullen
.
good
and
decent
people
live
in
Killavullen
who
,
up
to
a
few
year
ago
,
never
have
a
boil
water
notice
.
as
the
local
deputy
represent
that
area
,
I
still
cannot
get
a
answer
as
to
why
there
be
boil
water
notice
in
Killavullen
.
I
still
cannot
get
a
definitive
answer
from
Irish
Water
with
regard
to
Whitegate
or
Aghada
.
Cork
county
councillor
will
tell
the
Minister
of
State
the
same
.
it
be
report
by
Sean
O'Riordan
in
yesterday
's
Irish
Examiner
that
they
be
extremely
frustrate
by
the
lack
of
engagement
by
Irish
Water
on
matter
such
as
boil
water
notice
.
the
quality
of
communication
from
Irish
Water
have
diminish
substantially
in
the
past
12
month
.
it
be
very
hard
to
get
up
-
to
-
the
-
minute
information
.
if
we
be
try
to
serve
we
constituent
to
the
good
of
we
ability
,
they
deserve
answer
as
to
why
there
be
boil
water
notice
in
Killavullen
and
in
place
such
as
Whitegate
and
Aghada
.
we
have
not
be
able
to
define
or
pin
down
the
nature
of
the
problem
.
update
need
to
be
provide
and
proper
answer
give
to
public
representative
in
this
House
and
local
authority
.
the
quality
of
the
engagement
be
exceptionally
poor
.
dire
I
say
it
,
every
time
I
put
down
a
parliamentary
question
to
seek
information
from
the
Minister
's
Department
,
I
be
tell
it
be
not
a
matter
for
the
Department
.
in
the
most
recent
reply
,
date
yesterday
,
I
be
tell
that
it
be
not
a
matter
for
the
Department
,
that
all
operational
matter
be
a
matter
for
Irish
Water
,
and
that
the
Department
"
maintain
a
ongoing
engagement
with
Irish
Water
regard
strategic
,
financial
and
general
operational
matter
"
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
I
suggest
the
minister
's
Department
be
answerable
to
this
House
and
to
individual
deputy
when
we
put
down
parliamentary
question
as
to
why
there
be
boil
water
notice
or
when
we
seek
information
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
reverse
engine
on
the
policy
of
not
inform
we
,
as
member
,
because
we
need
to
be
able
to
inform
we
constituent
.
however
,
the
fundamental
question
be
why
Killavullen
,
as
one
example
,
have
boil
water
notice
.
what
be
the
reason
for
that
boil
water
notice
and
why
be
they
not
be
fix
?
why
be
the
problem
not
be
resolve
?
why
have
the
issue
in
Whitegate
and
Aghada
not
be
resolve
?
a
Cheann
Comhairle
,
thank
you
very
much
for
that
response
.
if
the
Department
maintain
a
relationship
on
operational
matter
,
I
respectfully
suggest
there
be
a
level
of
accountability
on
the
part
of
the
minister
to
this
House
with
regard
to
operational
matter
.
forty

you

I
apologise
to
the
deputy

I

ask
that
she
conclude
.
I
do
not

what
to

about
that
.
I

with
a

up

people
attend

it
be

by

and
Cork
County

,
work
through

to
bring

to

.
I
pay
tribute
to
everybody
who
be
involved
.
although
the
event
take
place
every
year
on

Sunday
,
if
the
minister
be
of
a
mind
and
be
still
in
the
Department
this
time
next
year
we
would
be
delighted
to
welcome
he
to
Mallow
.
he
could
see
for
himself
the
interplay
between
student
,
member
of
the
public
and
research
entity
like
Teagasc
and
all
the
citizen
science
engagement
that
take

it
be
a
perfect
model
and
I
acknowledge
the
successful
role
play
by

Partnership
in
bring
it
about
.
it
be
bring
science
to
the
people
and
a
excellent
example
of
science
in
action
.
a
entity
close
to
my
own
heart
be
the
Irish
Centre
for
Maternal
and
Child
Health
Research
,
INFANT
,
in
Cork
.
it
be
such
a
important
entity
in
term
of
perinatal
healthcare
,
make
pregnancy
safe
for
woman
,
ensure
the
health
and
future
well
-
being
of
child
and
improve
the
survival
and
long
-
term
health
outcome
for
newborn
baby
.
the
minister
must
forgive
I
for
be
parochial
again
,
but
if
he
ever
happen
to
find
himself
visit
University
College
Cork
and
if
he
visit
infant
,
he
will
see
for
himself
the
excellent
work
that
be
carry
.
it
be
really
impactful
research
meet
societal
challenge
,
which
be
so
important
to
all
of
we
.
it
be
incongruous
that
at
a
time
we
be
set
up
the
maritime
area
regulatory
authority
,
MARA
,
to
deal
with
consent
and
licence
around
offshore
wind
,
we
have
a
world
-
class
entity
call
MaREI
do
world
-
class
research
on
offshore
wind
.
the
science
have
move
ahead
of
implementation
on
the
ground
,
on
the
seabed
or
float
on
the
water
.
what
I
mean
be
that
while
we
be
do
excellent
research
here
,
we
need
MARA
to
issue
that
consent
when
it
be
create
in
order
that
the
excellent
research
on
wind
turbine
and
offshore
wind
can
lead
to
a
throughput
of
project
to
deal
with
we
future
energy
need
.
we
can
be
concentrate
on
the
excellence
of
science
in
Ireland
but
if
it
do
not
have
the
impact
on
the
island
of
Ireland
or
off
we
shore
and
if
there
be
not
expeditious
connectivity
with
industry
,
the
gap
will
need
to
be
plug
.
if
the
minister
visit
Cork
,
he
should
talk
to
the
people
in
MaREI
and
he
will
see
the
potential
.
we
in
Labour
support
the
call
of
retain

the

be
a
result
of
poor

and

of

and
the
constant
failure
to

furthermore
,
the
lack
of

make
it
difficult
for
retain

to
get

.
I
have
first
-
hand
experience
of
that
with
constituent
of
mine
.
retain
firefighter
be
effectively
lock
out
of
social
participation
.
when
they
be

to

,
they
must
be
within

of

.
they
be
essentially
under
a
form
of
house
arrest
while
on
call
.
it
be
unfathomable
that
we
would
expect
this
worker
to
put
up
with
such
condition
.
poor
pay
and
condition
have
result
in
this
crisis
of
retention
and
recruitment
.
some
source
indicate
that
as
many
as
60
%
of
worker
,
and
we
hear
this
already
tonight
,
be
consider

.
staff
shortage
among
the
fire

pose
a
serious
threat
to

and
consequently
to
everyone
's
safety
.
if
a
crew
respond
to
a
emergency
do
not
have
sufficient
number
to
enter
a
fire
,
we
could
be
talk
about
a
potential
loss
of
life
.
the
last
collective
agreement
make
with
retain
firefighter
be
23
year
ago
and
the
model
have
not
keep
pace
with
the
change
to
the
socioeconomic
and
working
landscape
of
the
country
.
retain
firefighter
be
suffer
economically
,
socially
and
mentally
.
it
be
time
the
government
introduce
a
more
sustainable
model
that
will
address
the
recruitment
and
retention
crisis
and
show
this
vital
worker
that
it
recognise
they
value
and
contribution
to
we
safety
as
citizen
by
provide
they
with
good
pay
and
working
condition
.
they
deserve
nothing
less
.
they
be
we
friend
,
neighbour
and
family
member
.
we
know
they
;
they
live
within
we
community
.
they
be
always
around
and
always
on
call
.
we
must
value
they
.
I
echo
the
point
of
previous
deputy
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
we
have
not
be
issue
with
a
copy
of
the
Minister
's
speech
.
it
be
important
in
debate
like
this
for
we
to
have
a
copy
in
order
that
we
can
parse
the
word
of
the
minister
as
he
be
speak
so
we
can
respond
on
the
hoof
,
as
it
be
.
I
note
that
he
say
the
review
will
be
publish
shortly
.
he
talk
about
change
in
structure
,
culture
and
the
delivery
model
.
he
speak
about
a
sequence
of
step
for
a
new
model
of
delivery
.
to
be
fair
to
he
,
I
have
no
doubt
about
the
minister
's
bona
fide
in
seek
to
arrive
at
a
solution
whereby
everybody
can
be
deal
with
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
.
I
suggest
to
the
minister
that
this
be
not
just
about
statistic
regard
fire
.
we
know
it
be
important
to
have
a
assessment
of
the
other
service
that
be
deliver
by
retain
firefighter
in
term
of
call
-
out
.
there
need
to
be
a
quantitative
and
qualitative
analysis
of
the
type
of
call
-
out
that
take
place
in
community
such
as
that
I
serve
in
which
firefighter
be
call
out
for
any
manner
and
number
of
reason
.
that
must
also
be
factor
in
when
the
minister
talk
about
a
new
model
of
delivery
.
the
bottom
line
for
all
of
we
be
that
in
support
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
,
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
firefighter
within
we
community
.
we
have
all
do
that
collectively
tonight
but
we
must
now
move
beyond
the
phase
of
empathy
and
sympathy
for
they
position
into
a
phase
where
we
have
some
regard
to
concrete
timeline
for
delivery
.
if
I
understand
the
minister
correctly
,
he
be
say
he
be
move
or
seek
to
move
in
that
direction
and
that
he
will
work
with
the
interested
party
to
deliver
a
new
model
.
inherent
within
that
,
however
,
must
be
a
recognition
of
the
pay
and
condition
of
worker
.
there
need
to
be
a
significant
improvement
on
that
.
if
I
be
to
ask
the
minister
one
thing
tonight
,
it
would
be
to
give
we
some
concrete
timeline
in
respect
of
when
he
expect
this
process
to
be
complete
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
everything
he
speak
about
in
he
appreciation
of
the
work
retain
firefighter
do
will
be
recognise
and
in
that
appreciation
and
recognition
of
they
role
,
the
fruit
of
they
labour
will
be
recognise
and
we
will
see
real
and
concrete
delivery
of
good
pay
and
condition
as
the
primary
aim
of
all
of
this
.
will
he
please
give
we
the
timeline
as
to
when
that
will
be
deliver
?
the
minister
speak
of
the
implication
for
both
side
.
I
be
not
quite
sure
exactly
what
he
mean
when
he
say
that
.
I
suppose
he
be
talk
about
the
worker
and
the
employer
.
there
be
always
a
way
of
find
solution
,
however
.
ultimately
,
we
want
to
ensure
that
we
have
a
cohort
of
professional
people
and
that
it
be
a
attractive
profession
to
enter
.
the
minister
say
that
be
what
he
want
to
achieve
.
let
we
take
he
at
he
word
.
he
might
give
we
timeline
,
however
.
I
also
note
the
minister
make
reference
to
gender
equality
in
respect
of
recruitment
and
retention
.
we
absolutely
support
he
in
that
regard
.
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
I
be
hopeful
that
we
would
have
a
set
of
timeline
.
I
would
not
accuse
the
minister
of
this
,
to
be
fair
,
but
very
often
we
have
aspirational
and
empathetic
statement
by
minister
come
before
we
.
what
the
people
in
the
Gallery
and
that
watch
outside
really
want
be
a
clear
indication
of
the
timeline
for
delivery
.
that
be
the
bottom
line
.
when
will
this
new
model
be
roll
out
?
what
be
the
timeline
and
the
stage
-
gate
process
that
have
to
be
go
through
to
ensure
we
get
over
all
the
hurdle
and
challenge
?
we
must
ensure
that
in
the
community
that
we
all
serve
,
there
be
a
fit
-
for
-
purpose
retain
fire
service
in
which
morale
be
high
and
the
staff
be
happy
to
do
they
job
.
we
must
continue
to
recognise
the
work
they
be
do
and
ensure
the
term
and
condition
of
employment
be
fit
for
purpose
and
be
not
anachronistic
.
we
should
not
take
they
for
grant
.
if
I
dare
say
it
,
I
think
they
may
be
take
for
grant
within
we
community
.
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
seriously
.
the
process
the
minister
talk
about
seem
to
be
real
,
if
it
be
chair
by
Mr.
Begg
.
however
,
we
will
have
to
see
implementation
of
it
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
it
have
come
to
my
attention
in
recent
day
that
it
be
the
intention
of
the
Court
Service
to
move
sitting
of
District
Court
no.
20
in
Mallow
,
County
Cork
,
and
centralise
that
service
in
Cork
city
.
I
wish
to
express
my
grave
concern
at
such
a
move
,
give
that
the
District
Court
in
Mallow
serve
a
large
geographical
area
that
extend
as
far
as
the
County
Kerry
border
and
north
to
County
Limerick
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
Court
Service
's
intention
be
to
move
District
Court
sitting
to
Cork
city
,
it
will
have
a
massive
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
region
I
represent
.
I
say
that
because
Mallow
host
sitting
in
respect
of
criminal
and
civil
proceedings
on
the
first
,
second
,
third
and
fourth
Tuesday
of
each
month
.
it
also
host
juvenile
and
family
case
on
the
first
Wednesday
of
each
month
and
childcare
and
HSE
proceedings
on
the
second
Wednesday
of
each
month
.
I
be
give
to
understand
the
sitting
will
move
to
Washington
Street
in
Cork
city
.
I
be
also
give
to
understand
that
the
Court
Service
administration
will
be
retain
in
Mallow
.
I
be
deeply
worried
that
it
be
now
court
service
policy
to
centralise
more
and
more
District
Court
sitting
.
this
be
happen
without
any
proper
scrutiny
of
that
policy
.
we
be
very
limited
in
what
we
can
do
to
scrutinise
that
.
the
only
opportunity
deputy
have
to
do
so
be
to
raise
it
as
a
topical
issue
matter
because
we
be
tell
the
Court
service
be
independent
,
as
it
should
be
.
we
acknowledge
that
and
there
be
no
question
about
it
.
there
be
issue
,
however
,
relate
to
the
administration
of
justice
.
I
be
particularly
concerned
about
the
family
court
and
the
seek
of
specific
order
.
for
instance
,
if
a
woman
,
and
it
be
largely
woman
,
come
before
the
court
to
seek
protection
regard
a
domestic
or
gender
-
base
violence
issue
,
that
service
will
not
be
available
at
the
most
local
level
within
the
District
Court
.
that
person
will
now
be
force
to
go
to
Cork
city
and
may
not
be
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
I
be
genuinely
worried
-
this
happen
in
Youghal
and
be
now
happen
in
Mallow
-
that
there
be
no
scrutiny
of
what
the
Court
Service
be
do
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
use
he
good
office
to
intervene
with
the
minister
for
Justice
,
deputy
McEntee
,
if
at
all
possible
.
the
minister
have
put
particular
emphasis
on
combate
gender
-
base
violence
and
have
acknowledge
the
"
stark
"
,
to
use
she
word
,
domestic
violence
figure
that
exist
in
this
country
.
if
we
remove
the
ability
of
people
to
get
access
to
the
court
at
the
most
local
level
through
District
Court
sitting
and
force
they
to
travel
further
to
seek
justice
and
to
interface
with
the
administration
of
justice
,
that
be
a
poor
show
on
the
part
of
the
Court
Service
.
I
ask
the
government
at
least
to
intervene
to
ensure
the
District
Court
sitting
at
Mallow
will
continue
to
be
host
there
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
have
receive
some
comfort
from
he
response
in
regard
to
the
remedial
work
that
be
to
be
carry
out
.
however
,
it
be
my
firm
contention
,
and
perhaps
I
should
have
make
this
clear
,
that
it
be
about
the
loss
of
court
sitting
in
Mallow
.
I
contend
it
would
have
be
very
easy
to
provide
alternative
accommodation
within
the
town
of
Mallow
itself
and
not
to
have
to
send
people
further
to
Fermoy
and
Cork
in
respect
of
circuit
Court
sitting
.
for
instance
,
the
Court
Service
could
have
engage
with
the
local
GAA
club
,
which
have
ample
facility
to
be
able
to
make
provision
for
court
sitting
.
it
be
the
loss
of
a
service
to
a
town
.
although
I
acknowledge
it
be
on
a
temporary
basis
,
the
fear
be
that
once
service
get
consolidate
to
another
court
,
they
do
not
return
,
and
we
have
Youghal
as
a
example
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
give
we
some
assurance
but
,
whether
the
Court
Service
listen
to
this
debate
or
not
,
it
be
vital
there
be
some
sort
of
confirmation
directly
from
the
Court
Service
that
it
be
its
intention
,
absolutely
and
utterly
,
to
ensure
we
service
will
be
return
to
Mallow
post
the
completion
of
remedial
work
.
I
still
need
to
interpret
the
word
of
the
Minister
of
State
in
respect
of
the
domestic
violence
provision
.
I
reiterate
that
it
be
about
ensure
that
where
there
be
a
government
policy
specifically
spearhead
by
the
minister
,
deputy
McEntee
,
in
regard
to
combate
gender
-
base
violence
,
and
with
the
minister
herself
acknowledge
the
stark
figure
in
regard
to
domestic
violence
,
we
do
not
put
in
place
impediment
for
woman
in
particular
where
there
be
a
necessity
to
ensure
the
service
be
within
they
own
town
or
as
near
as
possible
.
I
seek
assurance
that
service
will
be
return
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
the
motion
regard
retain
firefighter
.
on
Tuesday
,
15
November

on

a

and
in
accordance
with
Standing

(

,
that

must
be

.
I
welcome
the
Bill
.
we
will
support
it
and
seek
to
amend
it
in
place
if
that
be
allowable
.
I
will
start
with
the
issue
raise
by
the
minister
regard
incentive
provide
for
uilleann
pipe
maker
and
the
exemption
that
be
propose
relate
to
income
tax
.
the
uilleann
pipe
,
as
I
understand
it
,
carry
UN
heritage
status
,
which
we
all
support
.
they
be
deem
to
have
UNESCO
intangible
heritage
status
similar
to
that
of
the
hurley
or
,
the
hurl
,
depend
on
which
part
of
the
country
one
be
from
.
in
my
part
of
the
world
,
in
Cork
,
they
be
call
hurley
.
we
know
there
be
a
crisis
with
regard
to
ash
and
a
considerable
challenge
in
provide
for
hurl
,
which
have
UNESCO
intangible
heritage
status
.
if
the
minister
could
see
fit
to
look
at
the
game
of
hurl
and
the
value
of
the
hurl
,
or
hurley
,
she
would
receive
the
broad
acclamation
of
this
House
in
devise
a
similar
scheme
for
hurley
maker
.
for
some
time
now
,
we
have
be
advocate
for
increase
in
the
threshold
for
the
fuel
allowance
.
all
of
we
on
the
Opposition
bench
be
carry
to
the
minister
story
of
we
constituent
whereby
they
have
become
marginally
over
the
threshold
,
in
some
instance
by
a
matter
of
cent
,
and
be
deem
ineligible
.
this
happen
in
the
over
-
70
category
in
particular
where
there
would
have
be
a
small
occupational
pension
and
,
for
the
most
part
,
people
who
be
live
in
old
housing
stock
with
d
and
E
ber
rating
or
exemption
in
some
case
.
I
welcome
the
move
by
the
minister
to
increase
the
threshold
on
the
fuel
allowance
because
it
will
bring
many
people
into
the
net
.
in
my
constituency
office
,
I
field
many
query
about
the
fuel
allowance
and
the
increase
in
the
threshold
.
we
be
tee
up
a
increase
in
the
number
of
people
who
anticipate
that
they
will
apply
.
we
be
face
into
Christmas
.
if
there
be
any
possibility
that
it
could
be
fast
-
track
to
before
Christmas
,
there
would
be
many
more
applicant
in
the
system
.
if
there
be
any
way
to
do
that
,
I
respectfully
ask
the
minister
to
consider
it
,
give
that
we
be
in
the
midst
of
a
fuel
crisis
.
I
realise
it
may
not
be
possible
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
minister
have
make
a
substantial
change
to
fuel
allowance
policy
to
ensure
that
more
people
be
bring
into
the
net
.
that
have
to
be
acknowledge
.
I
could
use
the
cliché
and
say
that
I
be
glad
the
minister
listen
to
the
Labour
Party
on
this
.
the
Zeitgeist
be
capture
and
,
know
the
minister
to
be
a
sound
constituency
worker
in
she
own
constituency
,
I
be
sure
she
be
listen
to
many
people
who
be
put
over
the
threshold
and
take
on
board
the
view
of
people
in
she
constituency
and
make
change
accordingly
.
I
would
like
to
think
we
influence
the
minister
in
some
respect
with
regard
to
this
policy
change
.
I
would
like
to
raise
a
broad
policy
issue
.
the
debate
on
this
Bill
be
the
appropriate
time
and
place
to
raise
it
.
my
colleague
and
I
be
increasingly
find
issue
when
people
be
make
application
for
scheme
where
medical
evidence
be
necessary
,
there
be
a
pro
forma
protocol
to
go
through
,
with
a
doctor
's
letter
or
medical
evidence
depend
on
whether
it
be
illness
benefit
,
disability
allowance
,
invalidity
pension
or
partial
capacity
payment
,
or
whatever
else
the
payment
be
which
require
medical
evidence
.
the
issue
I
be
pick
up
when
assist
people
in
we
office
to
make
application
involve
a
lag
in
get
medical
evidence
because
of
the
challenge
that
people
face
in
get
general
practitioner
,
gps
.
person
will
want
something
sign
by
the
gp
and
will
phone
the
gp
's
practice
,
then
will
speak
to
the
gatekeeper
,
which
I
do
not
say
in
a
pejorative
way
,
the
secretary
or
administrator
.
it
can
often
take
a
long
time
for
that
form
to
be
sign
.
that
create
a
follow
-
on
lag
time
before
people
can
benefit
from
a
payment
that
they
be
eligible
for
anyway
.
can
we
look
at
the
need
for
people
to
go
into
pharmacy
and
get
print
-
out
of
they
prescription
,
where
they
have
to
go
to
the
gp
surgery
to
get
access
to
a
sign
form
from
a
gp
?
be
there
a
way
to
streamline
the
process
by
make
it
more
efficient
,
to
facilitate
the
applicant
,
include
with
the
option
for
a
paper
-
base
system
in
accordance
with
citizen
's
rights
and
wish
,
and
also
to
make
it
more
streamlined
for
the
gp
,
pharmacist
,
and
person
who
be
deal
with
the
case
in
the
Department
of
social
Protection
?
I
make
that
observation
base
on
the
dramatic
increase
in
the
number
of
application
that
we
be
field
in
constituency
office
where
there
be
illness
-
related
payment
to
be
make
and
particularly
in
light
of
Covid
,
since
we
be
see
a
great
preponderance
of
respiratory
-
related
illness
.
one
can
call
it
long
Covid
.
I
perceive
a
significant
increase
in
the
number
of
people
look
to
claim
disability
allowance
,
invalidity
pension
,
illness
benefit
and
so
on
.
I
make
that
point
in
the
hope
that
the
minister
might
respond
to
say
that
some
internal
work
be
go
on
to
try
to
make
it
as
streamlined
as
possible
to
ensure
that
the
applicant
can
have
a
decision
with
a
short
lead
-
in
time
,
if
possible
.
while
I
be
on
the
issue
of
medical
assessment
,
some
application
have
to
go
to
a
department
-
appoint
medical
assessor
.
be
there
scope
to
appoint
more
medical
assessor
in
the
Department
?
what
be
the
minister
's
view
on
whether
there
be
a
sufficient
number
of
medical
assessor
to
decide
on
a
initial
application
or
on
appeal
?
I
perceive
that
it
be
take
long
now
than
it
use
to
for
caseload
to
work
through
the
system
.
I
have
great
sympathy
for
employee
in
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
where
it
seem
that
caseload
be
increase
.
I
be
not
sure
whether
that
be
because
of
a
lack
of
additional
staff
be
assign
to
appeal
.
the
minister
's
perspective
would
be
helpful
.
I
refer
to
people
who
be
carer
and
,
want
to
use
the
right
language
,
to
people
who
be
neurodivergent
or
who
have
a
intellectual
disability
.
when
they
be
over
16
,
they
be
not
eligible
for
a
domiciliary
care
allowance
but
a
carer
's
benefit
or
allowance
may
have
be
apply
.
deputy
Kerrane
refer
to
this
too
.
I
share
she
view
that
there
be
circumstance
where
if
somebody
be
care
for
a
adult
and
have
be
eligible
for
that
carer
's
allowance
or
benefit
heretofore
,
a
spouse
may
work
overtime
,
which
then
have
a
massive
consequence
for
the
carer
.
carer
lose
carer
's
benefit
because
they
household
income
have
go
over
a
certain
threshold
and
they
lose
medical
card
too
.
there
would
be
great
sympathy
and
support
if
the
minister
be
to
look
at
what
I
perceive
to
be
a
relatively
small
number
of
case
where
people
be
care
for
people
and
have
lose
benefit
.
they
may
have
forgo
career
opportunity
themselves
,
have
decide
that
they
want
to
care
for
the
people
who
they
be
care
for
.
they
want
to
ensure
that
people
be
care
for
and
,
heretofore
,
the
State
recognise
that
in
certain
circumstance
.
however
,
the
spouse
will
rightly
have
seek
and
benefit
from
overtime
,
and
so
the
carer
be
kick
out
of
the
system
and
lose
everything
.
the
minister
will
be
familiar
with
such
case
.
if
that
could
be
look
at
again
,
it
would
be
greatly
appreciate
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
clarify
the
national
minimum
wage
.
with
the
cost
-
of
-
living
crisis
,
we
have
a
view
that
if
the
minimum
wage
could
be
raise
to
€
12
,
it
would
at
least
go
some
way
towards
meet
the
cost
-
of
-
living
issue
that
worker
have
encounter
.
I
refer
also
to
prsi
threshold
and
one
school
of
thought
.
I
defer
to
my
colleague
,
deputy
Ged
Nash
,
who
I
ask
about
this
early
.
he
say
that
as
PRSI
threshold
apply
now
,
if
there
be
a
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
,
the
prsi
contribution
that
be
due
would
mean
that
,
in
real
term
,
a
person
would
not
get
the
full
benefit
of
that
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
.
I
refer
quickly
to
the
minister
's
contribution
,
where
she
state
:
weekly
earnings
in
excess
of
€410
attract
employer
prsi
at
a
high
rate
of
11.05
%
.
the
earnings
threshold
increase
from
€
410
to
€
441
in
section
4
be
design
to
take
account
of
the
forthcoming
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
from
€
10.50
to
€
11.30
per
hour
.
I
would
like
some
clarification
on
that
in
case
there
be
a
real
-
term
loss
of
income
to
a
worker
as
a
result
of
a
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
.
I
would
appreciate
it
if
that
could
be
address
.
the
other
issue
be
people
who
be
on
invalidity
payment
not
be
eligible
for
the
bonus
payment
.
there
be
so
many
category
of
people
in
receipt
of
social
welfare
payment
who
will
receive
the
bonus
or
who
have
heretofore
and
I
do
not
understand
why
that
on
the
invalidity
pension
do
not
seem
to
have
be
the
beneficiary
of
the
bonus
payment
,
though
maybe
I
be
misread
it
.
I
would
like
some
clarification
on
that
.
I
may
,
as
I
say
,
have
it
wrong
and
I
put
a
health
warning
on
what
I
be
say
in
that
regard
as
well
.
broadly
speak
,
we
welcome
the
Bill
.
we
will
examine
it
on
committee
stage
.
we
recognise
that
of
we
in
Opposition
be
hamper
in
the
type
of
amendment
we
can
put
forward
but
them
the
rule
,
as
they
say
.
we
will
try
to
push
the
envelope
as
good
we
can
in
Opposition
to
try
to
promulgate
on
behalf
of
the
people
we
represent
.
if
some
of
the
process
I
have
reference
for
application
for
illness
-
related
payment
could
be
look
at
and
streamline
,
that
would
be
welcome
.
there
be
also
the
gap
that
still
exist
with
access
to
community
welfare
officer
in
certain
part
of
the
country
.
there
be
people
who
could
be
avail
of
exceptional
need
payment
and
urgent
need
payment
but
they
be
not
because
they
do
not
have
access
to
that
face
-
to
-
face
contact
with
cwo
on
the
ground
.
I
be
lucky
that
in
my
area
we
have
exceptional
cwo
but
there
be
part
of
the
country
where
there
be
still
gap
.
there
be
still
people
who
-
and
I
do
not
mean
this
in
any
condescending
or
patronising
way
-
will
not
interface
with
technology
or
if
they
have
to
go
on
the
phone
find
it
challenging
because
they
want
to
sit
down
and
give
context
to
the
case
they
be
make
.
we
should
not
lose
that
in
any
way
,
if
that
can
be
help
.
I
thank
both
deputy
.
I
could
hear
the
passion
in
both
they
voice
as
they
speak
about
this
issue
,
and
the
genuine
concern
they
both
have
.
the
HSE
winter
plan
for
2022
-
23
will
support
community
service
this
winter
to
respond
to
anticipate
high
level
.
Specific
initiative
for
SUH
include
three
healthcare
assistant
to
support
community
service
on
the
chronic
disease
hub
,
three

,
one
clinical

manager
to
act

,
three

and
one

in
keep
with
the
principle
of
Sláintecare
,
the

of
the

strike
by
the
fact
that
deputy
MacSharry
say
that
the
high
number
of

65

about

the
MRI

and
the

do
what
I
would
call
in
my
awkward
language
a
mapping
exercise
of
the
estimate
total
establishment
cost
by
species
in
2023
.
the
report
state
on
page
37
that
the
total
establishment
cost
for
a
conifer
plantation
will
be
approximately
€
7000
per
hectare
.
for
hard
broadleaf
,
it
be
to
be
€
10551
,
and
for
soft
broadleaf
it
be
to
be
€
9631
.
the
table
of
forestry
type
have
12
category
,
range
from
FT
1
to
FT
12
.
this
include
native
forest
,
forest
for
water
,
forest
on
public
land
,
emergent
forest
,
mix
high
forest
with
conifer
and
20
%

,
and
mix
high

with

spruce
and
20
%
broadleaf
.
the
propose
grant
per
hectare
for
a
native
forest
be
€
6744
.
that
include
hard
broadleaf
.
the
establishment
cost
be
more
than
the
premium
devise
in
the
new
forestry
programme
.
therein
lie
the
challenge
.
the
propose
establishment
grant
for
mix
high
forest
with
mainly
spruce
and
20
%
broadleaf
be
€
3850
.
the
analysis
that
Professor
O'Donoghue
and
the
Auxilia
Group
have
do
be
base
on
real
-
time
receipt
they
have
be
furnish
with
.
they
be
the
live
and
true
experience
of
forestry
company
.
the
true
cost
of
establishment
be
far
in
excess
of
the
propose
grant
rate
for
establishment
.
already
there
be
a
disincentive
on
the
part
of
the
forestry
company
to
be
able
to
move
into
a
position
whereby
they
can
meet
the
need
of
the
new
forestry
programme
without
incur
loss
.
in
other
word
,
it
will
not
pay
the
forestry
company
and
contractor
to
become
involved
in
the
new
programme
because
the
financial
metric
be
such
that
it
be
too
expensive
for
they
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
if
I
be
look
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
somebody
who
want
to
invest
in
forestry
or
have
a
land
hold
on
which
there
be
forestry
,
I
would
look
at
the
premium
.
for
example
,
for
native
forest
the
figure
be
€
1103
.
I
would
consider
that
a
very
good
premium
per
hectare
if
I
be
go
to
benefit
from
it
.
however
,
the
nub
of
all
of
this
be
whether
forestry
company
,
which
establish
road
and
land
holding
,
use
forwarder
and
so
on
.
I
be
no
expert
in
this
area
but
if
they
be
tell
we
,
and
the
research
be
bear
out
what
we
be
hear
on
the
ground
,
that
the
cost
of
establishment
be
far
in
excess
of
the
grant
that
will
be
provide
,
then
I
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
Minister
of
State
may
already
be
on
the
back
foot
.
in
that
context
,
it
be
vitally
important
that
she
bring
together
all
of
the
stakeholder
.
the
establishment
of
a
forestry
development
agency
could
bring
all
of
the
stakeholder
together
.
we
have
such
a
agency
for
food
,
namely
Bord
Bia
,
or
employment
development
,
such
as
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
create
a
agency
to
bring
all
of
the
stakeholder
together
,
she
would
be
able
to
work
through
a
lot
of
this
issue
.
if
Coillte
be
go
to
change
the
manner
in
which
it
operate
such
that
it
will
be
able
to
benefit
from
premium
,
there
may
be
a
challenge
for
private
forestry
company
which
may
be
suck
into
operation
devise
by
Coillte
because
of
economy
of
scale
.
there
be
considerable
worry
about
that
within
the
private
forestry
sector
.
Ash
dieback
need
a
scheme
.
the
Minister
of
State
make
reference
to
it
,
and
I
be
glad
she
do
so
,
but
we
need
something
more
concrete
than
what
we
have
hear
heretofore
regard
a
ash
dieback
scheme
.
it
have
to
be
sort
.
if
we
want
confidence
in
the
sector
,
we
need
to
sort
out
the
ash
dieback
scheme
.
a
forestry
development
agency
will
be
the
mechanism
for
the
Minister
of
State
and
government
to
succeed
.
for
confidence
to
exist
,
we
need
to
bring
all
of
the
stakeholder
together
.
my
wish
be
that
the
Minister
of
State
move
forward
and
achieve
what
be
necessary
.
I
be
delighted
that
this
Bill
will
now
make
it
to
Committee
stage
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
support
the
Bill
and
for
allow
it
through
this
stage
.
I
also
thank
Deputy
Canney
and
Grealish
for
help
to
bring
the
Bill
this
distance
.
I
thank
Deputy
Donnelly
and
Cronin
for
they
positive
word
in
favour
of
animal
welfare
.
this
be
one
of
the
issue
which
very
much
unite
everybody
in
here
in
that
the
relationship
we
have
with
we
own
pet
be
key
and
important
one
.
it
be
also
important
that
I
put
my
own
dog
on
the
record
.
Rua
be
a
14
-
year
-
old
cross
between
a
red
setter
and
a
golden
retriever
.
he
be
still
go
strong
at
that
age
.
he
run
the
field
and
the
country
road
and
,
as
typical
for
a
dog
of
he
age
,
he
be
very
laid
back
.
he
be
henpeck
by
we
three
hen
.
they
get
a
treat
and
he
get
a
clean
,
which
be
probably
no
harm
for
they
.
the
cat
be
always
wreck
he
head
on
a
daily
basis
as
well
.
I
will
finish
with
one
story
where
I
be
remind
of
a
local
artist
in
Navan
,
Patsy
Reel
,
who
some
people
may
know
.
Patsy
Reel
have
a
lovely
dog
who
live
in
Ludlow
Street
in
Navan
.
that
dog
use
to
travel
three
street
up
the
town
by
himself
,
go
to
a
pedestrian
crossing
and
wait
for
somebody
to
hit
the
light
so
that
he
could
cross
the
road
.
he
would
then
go
to
the
pet
shop
and
bark
outside
it
and
the
pet
shop
owner
would
throw
he
out
a
treat
.
at
the
end
of
the
week
Patsy
Reel
would
go
up
to
the
pet
shop
and
pay
the
tab
himself
.
it
be
incredible
.
obviously
,
the
relationship
between
family
and
pet
be
very
important
.
it
be
fair
to
say
that
in
that
relationship
,
we
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
dog
and
owe
they
a
responsibility
to
ensure
that
they
be
protect
and
be
treat
humanely
.
unfortunately
,
the
reality
be
often
very
different
.
for
some
people
,
they
only
see
pet
and
dog
as
a
source
of
big
money
and
profit
,
and
of
enormous
exploitation
.
incredible
damage
be
do
to
dog
on
a
daily
basis
,
especially
breed
animal
,
include
injury
,
ill
-
health
,
lack
of
veterinary
treatment
when
it
be
need
,
no
space
at
all
to
be
the
animal
that
it
be
,
very
poor
diet
,
wet
,
cold
and
dirty
condition
,
and
isolation
.
if
we
build
a
relationship
with
pet
on
the
basis
of
that
wrong
,
unjust
and
evil
at
the
heart
of
it
it
be
a
sad
reflection
on
the
rest
of
society
.
it
be
important
that
this
Bill
play
a
role
in
improve
that
condition
over
the
long
term
.

I
would
have
be
a
advocate
for

the
criminal

response
have
not
work

if
I
look
at

the

anecdotally

the

we

:

line

,
to
insert
the
follow
:
''
report
on
provision
and
cost
of

officer
4
.
the
minister
shall
,
within
6
month
of
the
passing
of
this
act
,
lay
a
report
before

during

hour

''
.
I
tab
this
amendment
because
I
wish
to
raise
again
the
issue
of
community
welfare
officer
service
in
the
context
of
ensure
that
people
who
need
face
-
to
-
face
meeting
with
community
welfare
officer
will
have
that
option
available
to
they
.
I
appreciate
that
last
night
the
minister
categorically
state
that
such
a
service
exist
whereby
if
somebody
want
to
make
a
appointment
,
he
or
she
can
do
so
.
we
all
recognise
the
vital
service
that
community
welfare
officer
provide
.
there
be
a
sense
,
however
,
from
my
perspective
as
a
typical
constituency
deputy
,
that
there
be
place
throughout
this
state
where
this
service
exist
once
upon
a
time
but
where
it
no
long
exist
.
in
that
area
,
the
service
be
move
away
from
the
customer
.
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
be
extremely
important
.
the
figure
up
to
the
end
of
September
2022
show
that
there
be
a
range
of
service
provide
,
include
:
support
with
bill
;
child
-
related
payment
;
support
with
clothing
;
support
with
funeral
;
support
with
general
housing
need
;
illness
expense
;
and
urgent
need
payment
.
up
to
the
end
of
September
2022
,
nearly
€
40
million
be
pay
out
.
it
be
a
vital
service
of
which
we
be
all
very
protective
,
include
the
minister
,
because
it
get
money
to
people
who
need
it
the
most
:
that
who
be
at
a
risk
of
poverty
.
it
be
such
a
flexible
way
in
which
to
resource
people
who
so
badly
need
resource
across
a
plethora
of
payment
.
the
discretionary
element
of
it
be
so
vital
that
it
must
be
protect
.
the
basis
of
the
amendment
be
to
ask
that
the
minister
would
lay
a
report
before
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
on
the
current
prevail
level
of
provision
of
and
accessibility
to
community
welfare
officer
,
cwo
,
and
on
the
additional
recruitment
and
other
cost
that
would
be
entail
in
ensure
a
community
welfare
officer
be
available
for
consultation
by
member
of
the
public
in
all
social
welfare
office
during
ordinary
hour
of
business
.
the
minister
may
tell
we
that
people
have
access
to
Intreo
office
.
we
can
take
as
a
give
the
fact
that
most
people
have
transport
now
,
but
not
everybody
do
.
I
have
witness
scenario
where
people
do
not
have
access
to
either
public
or
private
transport
,
who
rely
on
taxi
.
for
they
to
move
away
from
the
clinic
type
arrangement
that
once
exist
to
now
have
to
go
to
they
near
town
,
which
could
be
20
kilometer
or
30
kilometer
away
,
to
avail
of
a
Intreo
service
put
the
service
that
bit
far
away
from
they
.
all
I
be
call
for
in
this
amendment
be
that
we
would
at
least
have
some
degree
of
a
assessment
of
how
the
service
be
work
and
recognise
the
importance
of
it
.
I
be
conscious
of
timing
.
I
will
be
guide
by
you
good
self
,
acting
chair
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
I
know
she
to
be
a
fair
-
minded
person
.
if
she
say
she
will
do
this
report
,
I
know
she
will
do
it
.
I
do
not
want
to
labour
the
point
too
much
,
except
to
say
that
I
and
the
Labour
Party
would
be
quite
protective
of
the
scheme
.
when
we
hear
of
unconfirmed
report
about
the
creation
of
hub
within
the
Department
itself
on
decision
-
make
procedure
,
dare
I
say
that
we
naturally
become
paranoid
and
suspicious
.
paranoia
in
politics
be
no
bad
thing
,
as
long
as
it
be
in
small
micro
dose
.
we
all
have
very
good
relationship
with
individual
officer
right
across
the
system
.
it
be
a
excellent
department
that
deliver
so
much
for
citizen
.
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
legislation
go

the

will

where
the
Labour
Party
stand
in
term
of
protect
the
supplementary
allowance
scheme
and
the
role
of
the
community
welfare
officer
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
and
on
that
basis
I
shall
not
press
the
amendment
.
I
be
quite
happy
to
withdraw
it

the
commitment
I
have

I
move

no.

to

the

:
''
report
on
impact
of
employee
prsi
contribution
on
minimum
wage
employee
5
.
the
minister
shall
,
within
6
month
of
the
passing
of
this
act
,
lay
a
report
before
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
on
the
impact
of
employee
prsi
contribution
rate
on
worker
earn
the
national

have
regard
both
to
the
pend
increase
in
the
national
minimum
hourly
rate
of
pay
and
to
the
propose
transition
to
a
live
wage
.
''
.
we
be
back
to
the
issue
of
report
but
,
unfortunately
,
we
be
now
restricted
to
that
in
legislation
of
this
nature
.
they
be
the
only
way
we
can
have
scope
to
push
back
at
the
government
.
on
second
Stage
,
the
minister
state
:
weekly
earnings
in
excess
of
€410
attract
employer
prsi
at
a
high
rate
of
11.05
%
.
the
earnings
threshold
increase
from
€
410
to
€
441
in
section
4
be
design
to
take
account
of
the
forthcoming
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
from
€
10.50
to
€
11.30
per
hour
.
employer
with
employee
benefit
from
the
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
will
continue
to
attract
the
low
rate
of
employer
prsi
.
the
amendment
seek
to
provide
for
some
sort
of
a
assessment
of
how
that
increase
be
impact
on
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
in
term
of
the
potential
perceive
loss
of
real
income
as
a
result
of
the
increase
in
prsi
contribution
.
I
seek
some
clarity
from
the
minister
on
where
she
and
the
Department
be
in
respect
of
how
,
in
real
term
,
the
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
will
work
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
a
negative
impact
,
in
real
term
,
on
real
income
whereby
increase
wage
will
be
offset
by
increase
in
prsi
.
I
anticipate
the
minister
will
tell
I
that
,
in
real
term
,
that
will
not
be
the
case
and
there
be
a
provision
for
that
,
but
in
put
forward
the
amendment
I
be
seek
further
clarity
on
whether
,
if
there
be
to
be
a
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
,
it
will
be
worthwhile
for
a
employee
to
receive
that
increase
whereby
it
will
not
be
take
away
in
taxation
.
I
be
a
former
minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
if
that
be
what
the
minister
mean
.
it
be
not
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
the
taper
tax
relief
be
the
nub
of
it
.
I
do
not
propose
to
withdraw
the
amendment
.
I
propose
to
press
it
because
I
think
it
be
vital
.
I
note
the
minister
's
response
with
regard
to
the
work
that
be
ongoing
with
the
CSO
,
Revenue
and
various
line
Department
.
I
want
to
ensure
that
taper
tax
relief
issue
be
essentially
nail
down
,
however
.
obviously
,
there
be
a
impact
for
the
employer
as
well
that
cannot
be
underestimate
,
particularly
for
small
employer
and
small
company
,
entity
and
holding
.
it
be
,
therefore
,
my
intention
to
press
the
amendment
.
I
appreciate
that
.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
minister
and
the
generosity
of
she
offer
,
I
think
I
would
have
access
to
the
report
anyway
.
it
will
presumably
be
in
the
public
domain
.
however
-----
okay
.
indeed
.
as
a
matter
of
record
,
give
that
we
put
forward
the
amendment
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
,
we
would
still
like
to
ensure
the
amendment
be
promulgate
.
therefore
,
respectfully
,
that
be
what
I
intend
to
do
.
I
be
delighted
with
the
minister
's
offer
to
take
receipt
of
the
report
,
nonetheless
.
I
thank
she
for
that
.
yes
.
section
5
agree
to
.
I
wholeheartedly
support
deputy
Naughten
's
propose
amendment
because
more
of
we
be
interact
with
people
who
be
definitively
feel
the
effect
of
long
Covid
.
the
amendment
be
a
reasonable
one
in
that
it
seek
to
have
a
report
lay
before
the
House
on
particular
measure
,
especially
,
as
state
in
the
amendment
,
in
designate
long
Covid
as
a
occupational
illness
.
we
all
have
first
-
hand
experience
,
base
on
we
interaction
with
we
constituent
,
particularly
front
-
line
worker
.
if
something
can
be
devise
or
construct
to
recognise
that
formally
within
the
Department
of
social
Protection
to
ensure
there
be
a
payment
process
in
recognition
of
it
,
that
would
be
wholeheartedly
welcome
.
I
support
deputy
Kerrane
's
amendment
.
this
be
a
time
when
the
government
,
to
be
fair
to
it
,
and
the
Minister
for
further
and
High
Education
,
Research
,
Innovation
and
Science
,
deputy
Harris
,
be
put
particular
emphasis
on
apprenticeship
.
there
be
now
a
clear
government
policy
around
resourcing
apprenticeship
.
we
want
to
see
more
apprenticeship
come
from
right
across
the
demographic
spectrum
,
particularly
in
instance
where
people
have
not
attain
point
for
third
level
institution
and
they
may
be
think
about
apprenticeship
to
create
that
environment
where
they
be
encourage
to
take
up
apprenticeship
without
the
loss
of
any
element
of
they
household
income
.
in
that
context
,
I
support
the
amendment
.
I
move
amendment
no.

successful
,
and
no
independent
economic
or
social
impact
analysis
have
be
carry
out
to
determine
the
good
use
of
this
resource
;
and
—
although
in
the
intervene
year
there
have
be
report
of
serious
animal
welfare
concern
in
both
sector
,
there
be
a
lack
of
clear
statutory
conditionality
that
would
make
any
state
financial
support
conditional
on
rigorous
animal
welfare
criterion
be
satisfied
,
nor
be
any
condition
related
to
worker
's
rights
in
the
sector
attach
to
the
funding
;
believe
therefore
that
the
funding
model
under
section
12
of
the
Horse
and
Greyhound
Racing
Act
,
2001
be
in
urgent
need
of
review
and
replacement
,
and
call
on
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
to
carry
out
such
a
full
and
independent
review
of
the
fund
,
include
in
particular
with
recommendation
on
:
—
how
good
to
support
this
sector
,
that
involve
in
it
,
and
rural
community
;
—
measure
need
to
ensure
the
high
standard
of
animal
welfare
be
implement
and
comply
with
;
—
how
the
rights
of
worker
in
the
sector
can
be
improve
and
a
employment
regulation
order
introduce
to
set
minimum
rate
of
pay
and
condition
;
and
—
whether
and
how
funding
for
this
sector
and
other
sport
should
be
align
,
to
be
lay
before
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
within
six
month
,
with
the

be
in

before
the

date
of
any
further
presentation
of

it
be
wonderful
to
hear
the
sound
of
young
voice
in
the
Chamber

which
represent
a
wonderful
continuation

I
want
to
extend
to
Mrs.
Aylward
and
she
family
,
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
,
we
deep
sympathy
on
the
passing
of

I
be

to
the
Dáil

and
I
serve
on
the
Committee
on
Agriculture

Fishery
and
food
with
Bobby

like
every
member
of
this
House
,
I
find
he
to
be
a
warm
-
hearted
and
decent
person
who
be
collegiate
.
he
be
partisan
in
the
sense
that
he
be
staunch
Fianna

but
he
be
the
type
of
person
you
could
work
with
and
he
be
decent
,
affable
and
amiable
.
we
all
miss
he
and
it
be
hard
not
to
sense
he
spirit
here

we
be
deeply
sorry
for
the
Aylward

's
loss
.
he
will
be
remember
and
he
be
remember
beyond
the
enclave
of
south
Kilkenny
.
there
be
other
here
from
across
the
land
who
remember
he
fondly
as
a
decent
person
.
I
extend
we
deep
sympathy
to
the
Aylward
family
.
I
appreciate
the
deputy
's
kind
word
.
I
have
enjoy
be
the
minister
for
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
employment
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
year
and
work
with
IDA
Ireland
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
local
enterprise
office
,
leo
,
to
create
job
around
the
country
and
improve
worker
's
rights
.
I
have
enjoy
work
with
the
three
minister
of
State
who
have
serve
with
I
in
introduce
some
major
legislative
reform
in
the
area
of
competition
,
company
law
and
consumer
law
,
establish
the
corporate
Enforcement
Authority
,
reform
the
personal
injury
Assessment

,
PIAB
,
and
do
many
other
thing
in
that
period
,
which
have
really
fly
.
I
will
be
around
tomorrow
and
will
be
take
leader
's
question
on
Thursday
so
I
have
a
number
of
dáil
appearance
before
Saturday
.
to
answer
the
question
,
which
be
the
most
important
thing
,
IDA
Ireland
have
a
role
to
play
when
it
come
to
promote
good
rail
access
and
good
public
transport
to
industrial
park
.
IDA
Ireland
get
very
involved
in
air
connectivity
,
which
we
all
know
be
very
important
.
perhaps
it
need
to
get
a
little
more
involved
in
think
about
how
people
get
in
and
out
of
industrial
site
because
they
do
not
always
travel
by
car
.
there
be
definitely
a
opportunity
in
that
regard
and
I
will
make
sure
it
be
on
my
agenda
for
future
discussion
with
the
agency
.
I
thank
deputy
Nash
for
share
time
.
I
will
read
into
the
record
some
of
the
content
of
a
email
I
receive
on
Monday
from
a
Mr.
Justin
Moran
of
Wind
Energy
Ireland
in
respect
of
its
concern
about
the
foreshore
aspect
of
this
Bill
.
we
industry
be
concerned
that
the
effect
of
what
be
propose
will
be
to
slow
the
development
of
renewable
energy
and
undermine
effort
to
deliver
the
legally
bind
carbon
emission
reduction
require
by
the
Climate
Action
and
low
Carbon
development
(
amendment
)
Act
2021
.
this
be
because
the
act
,
by
widen
the
definition
of
the
foreshore
to
include
the
water
column
above
the
seabed
,
will
now
require
any
project
wish
to
carry
out
non-invasive
geophysical
survey
activity
in
the
water
above
the
foreshore
to
obtain
a
Foreshore
Site
investigation
licence
to
do
so
,
even
though
this
activity
be
already
regulate
by
the
National
Parks
&
Wildlife
Service
.
since
it
be
take
more
than
2
year
to
get
such
a
licence
the
actual
effect
of
this
act
will
be
to
block
any
new
geophysical
survey
activity
by
renewable
energy
project
until
the
establishment
of
the
maritime
Area
Regulatory
Authority
in
Q2
of
2023
.
we
lose
time
,
when
we
have
none
to
lose
.
Mr.
Moran
go
on
to
state
that
he
be
write
to
I
to
ask
I
and
,
by
inference
,
the
minister
to
support
the
recommendation
contain
in
the
Joint
Committee
on
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
's
pre-legislative
scrutiny
report
on
the
general
scheme
of
the
Bill
.
the
relevant
quote
from
that
report
be
:
the
committee
recommend
that
the
Department
obtain
and
publish
expert
legal
advice
and
stakeholder
consultation
,
namely
,
with
marine
environmental
stakeholder
,
the
fishing
community
,
and
the
offshore
renewable
energy
industry
,
so
as
to
inform
the
provision
of
safeguard
in
respect
of
the
amendment
in
Head
9
of
the
General
Scheme
.
the
email
,
which
I
be
sure
the
minister
have
,
and
he
certainly
have
be
make
aware
of
it
,
go
on
to
state
:
as
part
of
we
submission
to
the
pre-legislative
Scrutiny
of
the
Bill
we
request
a
legal
opinion
on
the
General
Scheme
which
be
provide
by
Arthur
Cox
and
which
be
give
to
the
committee
.
I
would
be
happy
to
share
it
with
you
...
[
etc
.
]
the
legal
opinion
state
:
we
expect
that
the
rationale
behind
this
be
to
facilitate
the
licencing
of
geophysical
survey
which
take
place
in
the
water
column
.
however
,
it
be
not
clear
why
such
survey
require
regulation
,
as
part
of
the
foreshore
licensing
process
,
when
that
survey
be
already
regulate
by
another
process
.
that
be
the
question
Wind
Energy
Ireland
be
ask
.
if
we
have
some
response
to
that
in
reply
to
this
debate
,
we
would
be
grateful
.
the
email
go
on
to
state
:
this
make
it
all
the
more
confusing
that
a
Bill
be
be
advance
to
amend
the
Foreshore
act
to
regulate
a
already
regulate
form
of
survey
activity
when
it
will
slow
the
development
of
offshore
wind
energy
which
will
serve
only
to
increase
carbon
emission
and
we
dependency
on
import
fossil
fuel
.
we
need
MARA
to
succeed
but
we
want
the
process
now
to
be
such
that
they
be
streamline
and
do
not
create
any
impediment
to
the
development
of
offshore
wind
so
as
to
increase
the
potential
for
energy
independence
on
this
island
.
that
be
ultimately
what
this
email
be
about
.
I
will
certainly
endeavour
to
ensure
that
the
Department
keep
the
family
update
regard
any
development
I
would
expect
to
happen
.
I
would
expect
that
a
Garda
Síochána
will
do
likewise
.
as
the
deputy
note
,
a
Garda
liaison
officer
have
be
appoint
.
of
course
,
we
think
of
all
that
who
lose
they
life
in
the
immediate
event
of
all
this
bombing
where
people
be
viciously
murder
and
injure
.
many
who
do
not
die
in
the
immediate
event
go
on
to
suffer
very
serious
consequence
and
may
have
have
they
life
shorten
.
the
announcement
by
a
Garda
Síochána
in
October
that
a
number
of
line
of
inquiry
have
be
identify
with
regard
to
the
Belturbet
bombing
and
that
a
senior
investigate
officer
have
be
appoint
to
lead
the
investigation
show
the
commitment
of
the
Garda
authority
to
this
legacy
case
.
despite
the
length
of
time
,
we
have
not
forget
and
a
Garda
Síochána
will
continue
to
investigate
.
it
be
almost
50
year
since
that
terrible
day
when
two
family
lose
they
love
one
forever
and
many
other
be
injure
.
hope
can
and
must
remain
for
that
family
that
the
perpetrator
can
be
bring
to
justice
.
the
government
's
approach
to
legacy
and
reconciliation
have
always
be
that
it
should
be
victim
-
cent
,
take
the
Stormont
House
agreement
as
its
starting
point
.
the
UK
's
legacy
Bill
,
which
seek
to
introduce
a
amnesty
for
crime
commit
during
the
trouble
,
risk
severely
damage
the
process
of
reconciliation
in
Northern
Ireland
and
here
.
it
be
the
firm
view
of
this
government
that
this
path
must
remain
open
to
victim
,
survivor
and
they
family
.
I
again
call
on
anybody
with
any
information
that
may
be
relevant
to
this
case
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
a
Garda
Síochána
to
aid
its
investigation
.

of
the
marine

I
welcome
the
motion
,
which
we
support
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
opposite
in
try
to
fix
a
perennial
problem
.
I
read
the
minister
's
speech
carefully
but
feel
that
there
be
much
more
that
can
be
do
to
increase
capacity
.
the
minister
refer
to
the
investment
in
diagnostics
and
primary
care
in
particular
.
it
be
all
well
and
good
to
state
that
the
HSE
have
add
90
additional
primary
care
team
in
the
country
but
there
be
still
a
issue
in
that
people
in
the
constituency
I
represent
cannot
get
to
the
gp
in
the
first
instance
.
the
diagnostic
piece
do
not
,
therefore
,
arise
.
I
be
tell
by
my
constituent
in
the
town
of
Mitchelstown
,
where
we
have
a
excellent
primary
care
centre
,
that
they
be
wait
up
to
two
or
three
week
-
four
week
in
one
instance
-
to
see
or
interact
with
a
gp
in
a
primary
care
centre
.
I
be
not
here
to
criticise
gps
.
they
be
absolutely
snow
under
.
we
know
that
.
however
,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
minister
,
until
such
time
as
people
can
get
access
to
the
gp
in
the
first
instance
,
the
issue
of
diagnostics
be
moot
.
I
need
to
know
how
we
be
go
to
fix
that
.
that
be
the
problem
that
I
need
to
see
fix
.
we
know
what
the
latent
effect
of
people
not
get
access
to
basic
gp
service
in
the
first
instance
be
.
it
just
heap
up
a
pile
of
problem
for
the
long
term
.
if
there
be
no
access
to
diagnostics
,
it
just
shore
up
a
pile
of
problem
down
the
line
.
I
need
answer
to
the
question
I
have
in
respect
of
Mitchelstown
.
the
situation
be
similar
in
Mallow
.
it
be
not
just
Mitchelstown
and
Mallow
,
but
every
town
in
the
country
.
why
be
it
that
people
now
have
to
wait
so
long
to
get
access
to
the
gp
?
I
do
not
blame
gps
.
we
be
very
quick
to
blame
.
we
need
to
blame
somebody
for
problem
.
however
,
where
be
the
solution
to
that
problem
?
as
a
local
deputy
,
I
,
for
one
,
have
do
a
lot
of
work
with
some
of
the
gp
practice
in
my
area
to
try
to
assist
they
with
visa
for
gps
come
in
from
third
country
or
from
outside
the
European
Union
.
we
have
have
some
measure
of
success
there
.
many
people
be
now
emigrate
and
take
up
job
opportunity
elsewhere
.
if
the
government
and
the
HSE
be
to
take
a
proactive
approach
to
recruiting
from
across
the
globe
-
there
be
precedent
for
this
and
it
be
be
do
day
in
and
day
out
-
we
could
bring
in
gps
from
other
country
,
which
would
help
alleviate
the
problem
in
place
like
Mitchelstown
and
Mallow
.
that
be
one
possible
solution
.
with
regard
to
out
-
of
-
hour
service
,
throughout
the
Christmas
period
,
we
all
receive
call
from
people
who
could
not
get
access
to
service
such
as
that
in
my
area
,
SouthDoc
.
SouthDoc
be
a
excellent
service
.
once
you
get
in
the
door
and
be
see
,
it
be
the
good
service
in
the
world
but
there
be
the
question
of
get
that
initial
access
.
I
know
of
some
very
acute
case
that
arise
over
the
Christmas
period
in
particular
.
I
do
not
have
a
degree
in
medicine
and
be
not
qualified
to
diagnose
but
,
if
I
be
contact
by
a
anxious
parent
who
be
seek
access
to
the
service
for
a
three
-
year
-
old
,
who
have
be
wait
six
,
seven
,
eight
,
nine
or
ten
hour
for
a
call
back
from
the
out
-
of
-
hour
service
and
who
do
not
want
to
go
to
the
emergency
department
because
they
be
petrified
of
go
to
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
we
have
a
serious
structural
problem
.
be
that
also
about
the
supply
of
gps
?
can
we
get
more
gps
?
the
minister
will
say
that
SouthDoc
,
Westdoc
or
the
service
in
whatever
part
of
the
country
one
might
be
from
operate
on
a
co-operative
basis
but
the
HSE
and
the
taxpayer
be
also
big
funder
of
this
service
.
we
have
skin
in
the
game
and
,
as
such
,
I
be
sure
that
we
have
influence
at
a
ministerial
level
over
how
this
service
operate
.
all
I
want
for
my
constituent
be
access
to
a
gp
when
they
need
it
because
,
once
someone
get
in
the
door
of
a
primary
care
centre
and
get
access
to
a
gp
,
a
lot
of
triage
can
be
do
,
reduce
the
need
for
people
to
present
to
the
accident
and
emergency
department
in
CUH
.
do
not
get
I
start
on
CUH
.
I
be
there
with
somebody
recently
and
see
the
ambulance
back
up
and
the
lack
of
bed
.
that
be
again
a
structural
problem
but
it
do
not
just
arise
because
of
RSV
or
Covid
because
the
trolley
number
be
now
up
in
the
month
of
June
and
July
as
well
.
there
be
evidence
for
that
.
it
be
a
year
-
round
thing
.
when
you
look
at
the
face
of
healthcare
professional
,
which
the
minister
have
see
,
include
nurse
,
doctor
,
attendant
and
people
work
on
the
floor
,
you
see
that
they
be
all
stress
out
to
the
hilt
.
that
be
not
sustainable
.
I
genuinely
worry
for
the
health
of
we
healthcare
professional
at
the
moment
.
I
genuinely
worry
that
many
of
they
be
now
say
they
have
have
enough
,
they
cannot
take
any
more
and
they
be
out
.
it
be
hard
to
blame
they
.
we
need
to
try
to
alleviate
the
pressure
.
there
be
another
way
of
alleviate
the
pressure
.
level
2
hospital
be
a
untapped
resource
.
take
Mallow
General
Hospital
for
example
.
the
minister
speak
to
issue
around
capital
expenditure
and
turn
brick
and
mortar
into
ward
.
we
have
a
42
-
bed
unit
in
Mallow
General
Hospital
that
be
all
but
build
.
the
hospital
be
operate
excellently
.
it
provide
a
great
deal
of
elective
care
for
people
.
it
be
excellent
in
diagnostics
.
many
people
could
be
triage
on
a
out
-
of
-
hour
basis
and
direct
into
hospital
like
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
fast
-
track
the
42
-
bed
unit
.
we
would
get
it
up
and
run
for
the
minister
.
we
would
take
people
out
of
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
and
move
they
into
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
as
well
as
place
like
Ennis
and
Nenagh
hospital
and
other
hospital
.
the
excellent
staff
on
the
ground
will
do
what
the
minister
have
speak
about
in
term
of
deliver
the
healthcare
we
need
.
that
would
alleviate
the
pressure
on
CUH
and
this
can
be
do
now
.
the
brick
and
mortar
be
there
.
I
invite
the
minister
to
visit
Mallow
to
take
a
look
at
it
for
himself
.
it
be
a
excellent
hospital
.
the
writing
be
on
the
wall
for
the
accident
and
emergency
department
a
long
time
ago
.
we
do
a
lot
of
work
in
respect
of
build
out
endoscopy
suite
,
medical
assessment
unit
,
a
local
injury
unit
,
a
urgent
care
centre
,
etc
.
we
now
have
a
42
-
bed
unit
and
if
the
minister
will
give
we
the
money
to
put
bed
into
it
,
we
will
do
the
business
for
he
.
that
be
what
we
want
to
do
in
Mallow
.
this
would
take
a
great
deal
of
pressure
,
from
a
regional
perspective
,
off
tertiary
care
centre
like
CUH
.
it
will
not
only
serve
the
people
of
Mallow
but
also
that
in
Tipperary
,
Limerick
,
Waterford
and
the
whole
catchment
area
.
if
we
look
at
Mallow
on
the
map
,
we
will
see
it
be
right
in
the
heart
of
Munster
.
this
be
what
we
be
talk
about
in
term
of
solution
.
the
minister
have
the
capability
,
wherewithal
and
means
to
do
this
because
he
be
the
minister
.
if
he
could
take
a
look
at
Mallow
General
Hospital
specifically
,
we
could
do
a
job
of
work
there
.
we
also
need
to
talk
about
ambulance
care
.
we
be
all
deeply
worried
about
people
who
work
in
the
ambulance
service
.
they
be
stress
out
as
well
.
they
be
be
ask
to
do
double
shift
and
take
on
extra
work
.
I
fear
for
they
health
and
safety
.
in
the
not
-
too
-
distant
past
,
we
have
a
case
where
somebody
go
home
from
do
a
shift
crash
because
they
be
just
absolutely
wreck
tired
,
to
use
my
local
parlance
and
to
speak
in
the
vernacular
.
we
just
cannot
have
that
.
person
need
to
have
adequate
rest
between
shift
.
we
cannot
have
a
situation
where
we
be
try
to
squeeze
more
and
more
hour
of
healthcare
professional
because
at
some
stage
it
become
dangerous
for
they
and
the
people
they
be
treat
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
take
a
look
at
this
aspect
.
in
the
few
second
I
have
leave
,
I
will
speak
about
pharmacy
,
which
be
yet
another
untapped
resource
.
community
pharmacy
have
tremendous
capacity
to
deliver
,
if
they
could
be
build
out
to
deliver
more
at
the
community
level
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
the
minister
may
be
do
some
work
in
this
area
already
.
I
ask
he
to
fast
-
track
that
.
pharmacist
be
excellent
.
they
provide
excellent
advice
to
people
in
they
community
daily
and
they
could
do
much
more
if
they
be
give
the
training
and
resource
.
increase
capacity
will
require
resource
.
I
think
the
minister
be
say
there
be
a
budget
of
€
23
billion
.
what
we
be
seek
for
the
few
small
thing
I
have
mention
would
not
be
big
money
at
all
.
the
minister
could
do
it
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
she
advocacy
in
this
regard
.
I
can
hear
the
passion
when
she
talk
about
this
matter
.
domestic
violence
have
increase
and
have
in
fact
double
in
the
past
15
year
.
in
my
previous
life
as
a
family
lawyer
,
l
deal
with
many
woman
,
and
some
man
,
who
be
victim
of
domestic
violence
.
Ms
Sarah
Grace
have
speak
very
eloquently
on
the
criminal
justice
system
.
I
could
use
the
term
"
in
part
"
,
but
to
a
large
extent
many
victim
do
not
come
forward
because
of
they
fear
of
the
criminal
justice
system
and
face
that
.
the
fact
that
we
now
have
Garda
training
will
help
a
lot
.
Gardaí
be
well
equip
in
how
to
deal
with
this
violence
.
judge
also
need
training
to
deal
with
victim
,
and
to
make
the
process
more
victim
friendly
and
victim
cent
,
so
there
be
not
that
fear
and
,
primarily
,
that
the
woman
be
believe
.
much
legislation
have
be
bring
in
relate
to
this
area
,
such
as
Coco
's
Law
.
there
be
now
legislation
around
coercive
control
,
which
the
deputy
mention
,
and
consent
,
which
do
not
even
exist
when
I
be
grow
up
.
we
have
make
huge
stride
but
this
be
,
as
it
be
call
in
France
,
the
grande
cause
nationale
.
it
be
something
that
will
never
go
away
.
we
have
to
stop
it
at
its
grassroots
level
before
it
become
something
really
violent
,
similar
to
what
happen
to
Ashling
Murphy
and
the
more
than
200
woman
who
have
die
since
1996
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
she
effort
on
this
issue
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Harris
,
have
a
zero
-
tolerance
approach
to
domestic
,
sexual
and
gender
-
base
violence
,
as
do
the
government
.
for
my
part
,
I
will
also
continue
to
advocate
.
I
thank
deputy
Kelly
for
share
time
.
the
Coillte
-
Gresham
House
partnership
seem
wrong
on
many
level
.
it
be
a
arrangement
which
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
facilitate
the
expatriation
of
million
of
euro
from
Irish
taxpayer
's
pocket
into
the
hand
of
fund
manager
and
on
that
basis
,
let
I
state
that
we
vehemently
oppose
this
arrangement
.
the
taxpayer
will
not
benefit
by
one
penny
from
this
entity
and
the
language
use
to
describe
how
much
land
will
be
acquire
have
vary
from
anywhere
between
3000
ha
,
such
as
we
have
hear
here
tonight
,
to
100000
ha
when
Mr.
Carlin
start
talk
about
this
two
week
ago
.
we
do
not
know
exactly
how
much
land
will
be
acquire
.
moreover
,
as
I
understand
it
-----
-----
and
I
have
the
right
to
speak
here
through
the
chair
,
the
upper
limit
on
how
much
land
will
be
acquire
have
not
be
absolutely
and
definitely
define
.
who
know
how
much
land
will
be
acquire
and
it
will
have
the
effect
of
displace
farmer
from
farming
activity
.
it
be
on
that
basis
that
we
absolutely
oppose
it
.
in
other
word
,
this
entity
be
hell
-
bend
on
acquire
as
much
land
as
it
can
grab
and
right
now
,
neither
the
Irish
taxpayer
nor
the
government
have
any
say
or
control
whatsoever
.
the
government
be
asleep
at
the
wheel
on
this
one
.
it
would
not
have
happen
on
anybody
else
's
watch
within
this
House
.
the
government
let
it
happen
and
do
not
put
a
halt
to
it
and
it
now
seem
that
it
be
sign
,
seal
and
deliver
.
it
be
a
awful
travesty
that
we
would
facilitate
in
this
country
a
situation
where
a
financial
house
from
the
UK
could
come
in
and
acquire
so
much
Irish
land
or
have
the
potential
to
do
so
.
it
will
walk
away
with
the
premia
,
let
there
no
doubt
about
it
.
the
forester
be
the
people
I
feel
sorry
for
in
all
of
this
,
because
they
will
end
up
be
price
-
taker
even
though
we
know
they
plant
all
of
the
forestry
in
this
country
at
present
.
once
you
start
acquire
more
land
,
you
start
acquire
control
of
the
means
of
production
and
once
you
start
control
this
,
then
you
can
set
the
price
.
before
we
know
it
,
private
forester
will
end
up
be
price
-
taker
and
many
of
they
will
become
enslave
to
this
new
entity
.
that
be
the
danger
I
fear
around
what
be
be
create
here
.
it
be
a
beast
over
which
there
will
be
no
control
.
the
dubious
assertion
of
the
Minister
,
Deputy
McConalogue
and
Eamon
Ryan
,
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
Senator
Hackett
,
that
Coillte
be
need
to
reach
the
8,000
ha
afforestation
target
,
may
be
true
.
I
do
not
think
anybody
would
argue
against
that
but
it
be
a
fallacy
to
assert
that
the
creation
of
this
Gresham
House
-
Coillte
entity
be
the
way
forward
to
achieve
the
8,000
ha
afforestation
target
.
we
know
the
national
afforestation
programme
be
carry
out
each
year
by
the
private
forestry
sector
.
here
you
have
a
Labour
Party
deputy
stand
up
in
defence
of
the
private
forestry
sector
because
we
see
chapter
and
verse
what
it
be
do
on
the
ground
in
term
of
put
plant
into
the
ground
and
how
they
be
try
to
manage
against
the
tooth
of
a
forestry
service
that
be
,
quite
frankly
,
not
fit
for
purpose
.
the
metric
be
proof
of
that
because
only
4779
ha
have
be
approve
for
planting
but
44766
ha
have
be
approve
for
felling
.
we
be
cut
down
more
tree
than
we
be
planting
in
this
country
,
and
it
pain
I
to
say
it
,
on
the
Green
Party
's
watch
.
that
be
the
sad
reality
of
it
.
the
fact
speak
for
themselves
.
if
you
read
the
dashboard
that
everybody
read
,
which
be
the
state
documentation
that
everybody
agree
be
the
industry
standard
-----
----
they
figure
be
there
.
I
will
finish
my
speech
uninterrupted
,
if
I
may
,
because
I
have
only
25
second
leave
.
the
government
fall
asleep
at
the
wheel
on
this
one
.
they
be
out
the
gap
on
this
one
but
there
may
be
hope
for
the
government
to
politically
use
whatever
might
and
main
it
can
to
pull
this
back
from
the
brink
because
we
do
not
want
a
situation
where
taxpayer
's
money
by
way
of
premia
,
end
up
in
London
or
wherever
,
on
the
back
and
through
the
sweat
of
the
Irish
forestry
sector
.
if
the
government
work
with
farmer
and
with
the
Irish
forestry
sector
,
it
can
deliver
on
its
target
and
within
the
means
it
have
at
its
disposal
but
it
must
be
look
at
.
I
ask
the
government
to
please
revise
this
decision
.
the
metric
speak
from
themselves
.
the
minister
be
cut
down
more
tree
than
he
be
planting
.
I
completely
appreciate
the
point
make
by
both
deputy
,
particularly
on
auditing
.
this
scheme
be
devise
under
a
European
framework
and
be
also
subject
to
state
aid
rule
so
it
be
not
simply
I
,
the
Department
or
a
lack
of
desire
.
it
be
construct
under
the
state
aid
rule
as
a
particular
intervention
measure
,
all
of
which
we
must
comply
with
.
therefore
,
please
do
not
let
I
go
further
than
I
can
in
any
of
that
.
the
minister
have
say
he
will
look
at
the
operation
of
the
scheme
,
in
broad
term
,
to
see
if
there
be
way
in
which
it
can
be
adapt
for
in
the
future
.
the
deputy
be
correct
to
point
out
the
impact
week
or
month
of
difficulty
can
have
on
the
viability
of
any
business
.
I
refer
,
in
particular
,
to
many
tourism
interest
that
find
it
difficult
to
attract
business
over
the
winter
period
.
when
one
look
at
the
scheme
and
how
it
have
operate
versus
expectation
,
one
must
also
consider
energy
price
and
where
they
be
relative
to
expectation
.
despite
they
have
be
extraordinarily
high
,
energy
price
be
much
low
than
we
have
expect
at
this
time
of
year
both
because
of
change
in
energy
price
in
respect
of
oil
and
gas
generally
on
the
wholesale
market
,
and
the
considerably
warm
than
expect
weather
for
the
period
.
this
have
mean
that
bill
,
while
they
be
exceptionally
high
during
the
August
-
September
period
-
which
I
see
in
my
own
constituency
-
have
not
be
as
high
as
might
have
be
expect
.
by
way
of
additional
detail
,
wholesale
gas
price
be
expect
to
be
57
%
low
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
than
they
would
have
be
expect
to
be
last
October
.
of
course
,
the
winter
period
be
not
over
and
gas
and
oil
price
remain
considerably
high
,
but
it
be
worth
make
the
point
that
they
be
low
.
we
continue
to
urge
eligible
business
to
make
claim
under
the
scheme
.
the
window
for
make
claim
be
important
.
Revenue
have
endeavour
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
.
I
appreciate
that
this
speak
to
the
application
of
the
scheme
more
broadly
and
not
to
the
specific
point
raise
by
the
Deputy
in
respect
of
the
exclusion
from
that
part
of
the
scheme
.
I
completely

Revenue

I
completely
appreciate
the

make
by
both

,
particularly
on
auditing

this
scheme
be
devise
under
a
European
framework

be
also
subject

state

it
be
not
simply
I
,
the

a
lack
of
desire

it
be
construct
under
the
state
aid
rule
as
a
particular
intervention
measure
,
all
of
which
we
must
comply
with
.
therefore
,
please
do
not
let
I
go
further
than
I
can
in
any
of
that
.
the
minister
have
say
he
will
look
at
the
operation
of
the
scheme
,
in
broad
term
,
to
see
if
there
be
way
in
which
it
can
be
adapt
for
in
the
future
.
the
deputy
be
correct
to
point
out
the
impact
week
or
month
of
difficulty
can
have
on
the
viability
of
any
business
.
I
refer
,
in
particular
,
to
many
tourism
interest
that
find
it
difficult
to
attract
business
over
the
winter
period
.
when
one
look
at
the
scheme
and
how
it
have
operate
versus
expectation
,
one
must
also
consider
energy
price
and
where
they
be
relative
to
expectation
.
despite
they
have
be
extraordinarily
high
,
energy
price
be
much
low
than
we
have
expect
at
this
time
of
year
both
because
of
change
in
energy
price
in
respect
of
oil
and
gas
generally
on
the
wholesale
market
,
and
the
considerably
warm
than
expect
weather
for
the
period
.
this
have
mean
that
bill
,
while
they
be
exceptionally
high
during
the
August
-
September
period
-
which
I
see
in
my
own
constituency
-
have
not
be
as
high
as
might
have
be
expect
.
by
way
of
additional
detail
,
wholesale
gas
price
be
expect
to
be
57
%
low
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
than
they
would
have
be
expect
to
be
last
October
.
of
course
,
the
winter
period
be
not
over
and
gas
and
oil
price
remain
considerably
high
,
but
it
be
worth
make
the
point
that
they
be
low
.
we
continue

I
welcome
the
motion
and
support
it
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
because
there
be
a
tacit
acknowledgement
of
the
challenge
that
face
all
of
we
in
respect
of
the
provision
of
service
through
CAMHS
.
I
think
everybody
accept
the
report
of
the
Mental
Health
Commission
and
the
recommendation
therein
.
I
be
particularly
take
by
the
part
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
where
she
refer
to
CAMHS
team
.
she
say
:
CAMHS
team
receive
and
triage
nearly
21000
referral
annually
and
deliver
225000
appointment
for
child
and
young
people
require
assessment
and
intervention
each
year
.
between
2020
and
2021
,
CAMH
service
have
experience
a
33
%
increase
in
demand
,
while
concurrently
increase
they
activity
level
,
see
21
%
more
case
during
the
same
period
.
they
be
extraordinary
figure
when
you
think
about
it
.
they
present
a
picture
of
the
enormity
of
the
challenge
that
face
all
of
we
in
respect
of
ensure
that
,
where
somebody
need
access
to
a
service
in
a
acute
setting
or
on
a
acute
basis
,
they
have
that
pathway
within
that
24
to
48
hour
period
.
when
there
be
a
threat
to
life
,
there
be
so
many
pathway
to
save
a
life
in
conventional
medicine
.
if
there
be
a
road
traffic
accident
,
the
ambulance
be
call
,
you
go
to
the
near
trauma
centre
and
the
resource
be
there
to
save
life
and
limb
straight
away
.
when
it
come
to
mental
health
,
it
be
just
not
there
.
it
be
not
guarantee
to
the
same
extent
.
I
have
sympathy
for
the
position
in
which
the
Minister
of
State
find
themselves
.
if
I
be
Sinn
Féin
I
would
not
be
make
promise
or
guarantee
be
able
to
fix
this
because
it
will
be
a
long
,
slow
road
.
however
,
the
Mental
Health
Commission
's
report
be
very
clear
in
respect
of
the
regulation
of
camh
.
this
have
always
be
a
key
point
for
we
.
there
be
a
inconsistency
in
the
service
depend
on
where
people
live
in
the
country
.
I
live
in
CHO
4
.
the
figure
for
CHO
4
,
which
be
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
,
be
frightening
.
I
raise
this
in
a
parliamentary
question
to
the
Minister
for
Health
and
get
my
reply
on
25
January
.
I
ask
for
the
number
of
person
wait
to
be
see
by
child
and
adolescent
mental
health
service
by
CHO
and
LHO
and
the
length
of
time
they
be
wait
.
there
be
857
people
wait
in
total
in
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
.
that
be
too
many
people
.
there
be
296
wait
over
a
year
in
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
.
this
be
from
25
January
so
that
be
the
most
up
-
to
-
date
figure
there
be
.
there
be
a
glaring
inconsistency
between
what
be
happen
in
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
and
the
Galway
region
,
if
I
be
be
a
bit
cheeky
about
it
,
or
the
Waterford
region
.
the
figure
be
incomparable
.
in
CHO
1
,
the
Donegal
region
,
there
be
603
people
wait
long
than
12
month
whereas
in
CHO
2
,
the
Galway
region
or
the
west
of
Ireland
,
there
be
24
.
to
go
back
to
my
early
point
,
if
someone
present
to
a
hospital
with
a
acute
medical
condition
,
they
will
get
they
surgery
or
intervention
,
they
will
get
the
medicine
they
need
and
they
will
get
it
pretty
much
straight
away
once
they
be
inside
the
door
of
the
hospital
,
primary
care
setting
or
secondary
care
setting
.
when
it
come
to
mental
health
service
for
child
and
adolescent
,
that
same
level
of
urgency
do
not
exist
.
the
point
make
by
the
Mental
Health
Commission
on
the
regulation
of
CAMHS
be
important
because
we
need
that
consistency
of
approach
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
say
that
the
revise
mental
health
Bill
should
make
provision
for
that
.
I
be
not
sure
where
that
Bill
be
or
when
it
be
suppose
to
come
before
we
-
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
that
question
-
but
that
provision
need
to
be
nail
down
.
it
be
not
fair
that
the
people
in
Cork
and
Kerry
have
to
wait
so
much
long
than
people
in
another
part
of
the
country
.
we
should
not
have
that
inconsistency
.
the
service
should
not
discriminate
against
people
base
on
they
geography
.
we
all
face
scenario
as
public
representative
,
deputy
and
Senator
,
on
a
daily
basis
where
family
approach
we
.
we
pick
up
the
phone
to
the
chief
officer
of
the
CHO
or
whoever
it
might
be
.
this
be
all
inherently
good
people
who
want
to
help
we
.
in
some
case
,
it
have
take
my
intervention
with
somebody
of
standing
within
the
HSE
on
behalf
of
a
family
to
get
access
to
a
service
.
family
member
tell
I
about
a
young
man
or
woman
who
have
suicidal
ideation
and
after
my
intervention
,
a
appointment
be
make
and
the
young
person
in
question
be
back
in
the
system
.
if
the
system
be
work
correctly
,
it
would
not
take
a
intervention
by
a
deputy
,
Senator
or
councillor
for
someone
to
get
access
to
a
service
.
that
be
wrong
.
there
be
many
people
out
there
-
and
I
do
not
mean
this
in
a
patronising
way
-
who
may
not
have
the
capacity
to
advocate
or
the
wherewithal
to
phone
they
local
public
representative
.
they
should
not
have
to
do
that
to
get
access
to
a
service
.
this
be
such
a
sensitive
issue
that
one
do
not
wish
to
be
political
or
partisan
about
it
but
we
be
not
see
a
improvement
in
the
waiting
list
,
year
on
year
.
what
the
report
of
the
Mental
Health
Commission
show
we
be
illustrative
,
but
it
probably
just
crystallise
we
experience
,
as
public
representative
,
of
mental
health
service
.
it
do
not
tell
we
anything
we
do
not
already
know
.
many
of
we
have
be
experience
the
CAMHS
phenomenon
for
many
year
.
I
be
provide
with
figure
for
wait
list
on
16
September
2022
.
the
information
be
separate
into
people
who
have
be
wait
for
a
appointment
for
less
than
12
week
,
between
12
and
26
week
,
between
26
and
39
week
,
between
39
and
52
week
and
more
than
52
week
.
the
total
be
4,127
.
the
figure
as
of
25
January
be
4293
.
the
number
on
waiting
list
be
increase
.
I
take
the
point
the
Minister
of
State
make
that
there
have
be
a
massive
increase
in
the
demand
for
service
and
that
the
number
of
appointment
stand
at
approximately
250000
.
however
,
we
be
not
keep
ahead
of
the
game
and
ensure
that
people
can
get
through
the
front
door
,
in
the
first
instance
.
it
have
be
all
of
we
experience
that
once
people
get
in
through
the
front
door
,
service
start
to
wrap
around
they
.
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
have
we
spend
€
15
million
on
recruitment
agency
?
that
money
have
be
spend
by
the
HSE
on
recruitment
agency
to
recruit
for
post
that
be
vacant
.
the
Minister
of
State
should
intervene
.
taxpayer
be
not
get
a
return
on
they
investment
via
the
HSE
.
we
be
spend
€
15
million
on
recruitment
agency
to
recruit
for
the
HSE
to
fill
the
post
that
need
to
be
fill
in
the
area
we
be
talk
about
.
that
need
to
be
look
at
.
we
must
ask
where
be
the
value
for
money
and
the
return
on
that
investment
for
the
taxpayer
.
why
be
this
post
not
be
fill
?
we
stand
in
this
Chamber
,
week
in
and
week
out
,
and
talk
about
the
recruitment
crisis
.
be
there
a
way
to
level
the
playing
field
between
cho
?
where
there
be
some
capacity
in
one
cho
,
can
it
be
transfer
to
another
cho
where
there
be
a
acute
level
of
need
?
that
could
be
do
as
we
compare
and
contrast
service
.
we
have
all
now
move
online
.
God
forbid
,
but
if
I
be
look
for
a
intervention
tomorrow
and
the
service
I
require
be
in
Sligo
,
I
could
have
a
online
intervention
.
the
tool
of
the
trade
be
there
to
make
that
happen
.
in
the
interim
,
I
be
ask
that
we
make
service
available
to
people
.
even
if
they
be
make
available
as
online
resource
or
tool
to
begin
with
,
it
would
be
a
start
to
ensure
we
level
the
playing
field
for
the
people
I
represent
in
the
Cork
-
Kerry
region

to

the
frustration
of
people
in
this
community
.
there
be
no
testimony
more
compelling
than
that
of
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
today
because
that
be
a
first
-
hand
account
.
if
that
do
not
impact
on
all
of
we
,
and
particularly
on
the
government
,
then
we
be
in
cold
time
as
regards
the
promulgation
of
this
legislation
.
I
put
forward
this
amendment
on
committee
stage
because
like
other
,
we
in
the
Opposition
feel
so
constrain
in
seek
to
amend
legislation
.
the
only
tool
we
have
in
we
toolkit
so
as
to
avoid
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
be
to
put
down
this
amendment
and
seek
to
have
they
repeat
from
committee
to
report
stage
.
this
amendment
be
proportionate
.
the
minister
will
say
it
be
not
but
I
would
argue
with
he
that
it
be
because
this
scheme
be
vast
in
its
undertaking
and
give
the
number
of
people
who
would
be
potentially
omit
from
it
,
we
believe
that
at
the
very
minimum
this
amendment
deserve
to
be
pass
.
all
it
call
for
be
a
report
into
"
whether
and
to
what
extent
person
engage
in
the
management
,
administration
or
operation
of
relevant
institution
should
be
permit
or
require
to
contribute
to
the
cost
of
make
payment
under
this
act
"
.
I
do
not
see
how
that
be
disproportionate
.
it
seem
reasonable
to
I
.
second
,
the
report
would
examine
"
whether
the
180
day
residence
requirement
provide
for
in
section
13
(
1
)
and
(
4
)
should
be
amend
or
repeal
"
.
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
look
back
at
a
section
of
legislation
that
have
be
pass
to
ask
whether
it
be
fit
for
purpose
and
whether
it
should
be
review
.
third
,
the
report
would
look
into
"
whether
the
scheme
should
be
extend
so
as
to
make
provision
for
recognise
person
who
be
board
out
as
child
as
relevant
person
"
.
when
I
put
forward
my
amendment
,
which
I
be
happy
to
share
with
colleague
,
the
minister
address
the
issue
of
the
180
day
on
Committee
stage
.
he
say
:
absence
of
up
to
180
day
will
not
disqualify
somebody
from
make
a
claim
.
the
reason
for
that
be
that
we
know
there
be
people
who
,
because
of
what
happen
in
the
institution
,
the
ill
health
they
suffer
,
the
poor
condition
or
the
poor
treatment
,
spend
large
amount
of
time
not
in
the
home
but
in
hospital
,
often
return
to
the
home
...
we
just
want
that
people
to
be
include
.
we
want
any
report
into
or
review
of
the
scheme
to
ensure
that
people
be
include
so
they
be
not
exclude
forever
or
so
the
next
generation
of
politician
be
not
revisit
this
in
20
or
30
year
'
time
.
if
the
lesson
of
the
last
week
or
two
be
anything
to
go
by
,
we
will
be
revisit
this
,
mark
my
word
,
as
sure
as
night
follow
day
.
the
people
who
be
aged
from
zero
to
six
month
will
wish
for
this
to
be
revisit
somewhere
down
the
line
.
I
have
no
doubt
about
that
.
the
evidence
of
the
correspondence
we
have
receive
should
be
enough
to
jolt
any
government
into
action
in
respect
of
that
cohort
of
people
who
need
for
this
to
be
deal
with
,
now
and
in
a
contemporary
way
-
not
down
the
line
but
now
.
that
be
the
hallmark
of
fairness
,
for
it
to
be
deal
with
in
the
here
and
now
.
in
the
amendment
,
we
be
look
specifically
for
a
report
into
whether
the
duration
of
the
scheme
should
be
extend
.
that
be
not
unreasonable
.
we
be
very
conscious
when
we
be
put
forward
the
wording
of
this
amendment
that
we
would
seek
to
be
reasonable
in
we
approach
.
we
do
not
want
to
be
rhetorical
but
ask
the
minister
in
the
hope
he
would
see
that
nothing
we
be
request
here
be
unreasonable
or
disproportionate
.
that
be
why
we
find
ourselves
here
today
on
report
stage
,
because
we
fail
on
Committee
Stage
to
have
that
measure
put
into
the
legislation
and
we
be
now
ask
again
.
we
be
come
back
to
the
table
to
ask
that
that
people
be
look
after
.
look
at
the
minister
's
response
in
respect
of
section
42
of
the
Act
,
he
again
state
:
the
intention
of
section
42
be
for
two
review
to
be
conduct
on
the
scheme
.
one
be
a
interim
review
to
be
commence
two
year
after
the
establishment
day
while
the
other
be
to
be
commence
after
the
completion
of
the
scheme
.
section
42
set
out
a
list
of
matter
that
should
be
consider
as
part
of
this
review
and
allow
for
the
minister
to
specify
any
additional
matter
.
the
minister
have
the
power
to
specify
any
additional
matter
.
furthermore
,
he
state
,
"
section
12
provide
that
the
chief
decide
officer
shall
prepare
a
annual
report
on
the
performance
of
he
or
she
function
and
that
each
annual
report
will
be
lay
before
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
"
we
be
put
much
store
in
what
the
chief
decide
officer
will
determine
.
the
minister
can
"
specify
any
additional
matter
.
"
that
be
the
minister
's
word
when
he
speak
on
Committee
stage
.
I
be
sure
he
will
repeat
that
word
at
report
Stage
.
all
we
be
ask
be
for
the
report
on
the
operation
of
the
scheme
to
include
the
subsection
we
have
set
out
in
amendment
no.
2
.
that
be
not
a
unreasonable
request
.
I
say
this
in
a
absolutely
non-partisan
way
and
in
the
spirit
and
tone
of
be
very
conscious
about
the
impact
of
this
issue
on
society
.
there
be
a
psychological
scar
on
society
because
of
this
issue
and
the
attempt
by
this
generation
of
politician
who
have
this
mandate
now
to
try
to
improve
the
scheme
in
a
way
that
ensure
we
will
not
be
revisit
this
at
some
future
date
.
to
be
fair
,
one
could
have
anticipate
the
minister
's
response
because
it
be
consistent
with
the
response
on
committee
stage
.
I
be
hopeful
there
would
be
some
movement
by
the
minister
in
respect
of
what
we
be
seek
to
do
in
amendment
no.
2
.
I
share
the
view
of
deputy
Cairn
in
respect
of
the
culture
that
seemingly
exist
within
the
Department
in
respect
of
the
freedom
of
information
request
that
be
put
in
by
Elaine
Loughlin
and
Conall
Ó
Fátharta
,
as
report
in
yesterday
's
Irish
Examiner
,
which
report
:
"
premature
release
of
policy
deliberation
into
the
public
domain
carry
significant
risk
to
policy
decision
-
making
process
,
particularly
in
area
that
be
highly
contentious
.
"
do
not
infantilise
people
who
have
a
voice
themselves
.
do
not
refer
to
they
as
a
"
vulnerable
group
"
.
this
be
people
who
be
well
able
to
stand
up
for
themselves
.
do
not
condescend
to
they
.
do
not
patronise
they
.
meet
they
as
equal
.
we
know
that
the
scheme
be
flawed
because
we
know
there
be
so
many
who
be
exclude
because
of
this
legislation
.
we
know
that
quite
a
number
of
people
will
not
have
access
to
healthcare
.
all
we
be
seek
,
in
what
we
feel
be
a
very
reasonable
way
,
be
that
the
minister
shift
a
little
bit
towards
the
position
the
Opposition
be
promulgate
.
within
the
very
limited
means
we
have
,
we
want
to
at
least
keep
on
the
agenda
the
very
people
we
be
seek
to
represent
,
namely
,
that
who
be
board
out
,
people
who
be
bear
in
mother
and
baby
home
,
and
the
people
who
be
in
birth
to
six
month
age
category
.
I
have
a
daughter
at
home
who
be
six
month
old
.
any
of
we
who
have
child
see
the
importance
of
the
first
six
month
in
any
child
's
life
and
the
importance
of
the
interaction
between
the
parent
and
child
.
for
the
life
of
I
,
I
do
not
see
how
,
logically
,
we
can
exclude
people
in
that
category
.
the
logic
of
the
position
be
take
by
the
minister
be
down
to
finance
and
how
much
money
will
be
spend
on
the
scheme
.
so
many
people
be
be
exclude
,
which
be
not
fair
.
on
that
basis
,
we
will
press
the
amendment
and
seek
to
vote
on
it
.
I
propose
this
amendment
and
there
be
five
second
leave
in
the
slot
.
the
idea
that
people
cannot
institute
civil
proceedings
if
they
receive
a
payment
be
something
that
will
be
revisit
in
law
.
this
will
come
back
to
haunt
we
.
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
.
I
raise
the
issue
of
the
role
of
chief
decide
officer
on
Committee
stage
.
there
be
still
no
clarity
as
to
the
status
of
that
role
.
will
it
be
a
Civil
service
role
?
will
it
be
subject
to
the
Public
appointment
service
process
?
what
grade
will
the
appoint
person
be
?
be
there
a
equivalent
grade
within
the
Civil
Service
in
respect
of
that
role
?
what
role
will
public
representative
have
?
I
draw
similarity
between
when
I
make
representation
to
the
HSE
or
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
there
be
any
number
of
officer
with
whom
I
deal
with
depend
on
the
issue
and
there
be
a
hierarchy
there
.
first
,
we
need
to
be
able
to
make
representation
,
on
behalf
of
we
constituent
,
to
the
decide
officer
or
a
designate
person
.
second
,
what
be
the
infrastructure
around
that
person
?
what
we
do
not
want
be
a
situation
in
which
we
be
seek
to
advocate
on
behalf
of
people
in
a
reasonable
fashion
but
we
be
disbarr
from
do
so
.
I
need
to
know
,
in
simple
term
,
whether
I
can
make
representation
on
behalf
of
my
constituent
who
present
to
I
regard
they
interaction
with
the
office
that
be
to
be
set
up
?
I
thank
member
of
we
usher
staff
,
who
be
unfailingly
helpful
to
we
,
for
have
bring
to
my
attention
early
the
fact
that
a
deputy
be
celebrate
he
40th
anniversary
as
a
member
of
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
this
week
.
the
deputy
in
question
serve
for
four
year
in
Seanad
Éireann
and
have
serve
for
36
year
in
this
House
.

I
ask
the
Minister
for
social
Protection
whether
income
disregard
could
be
review
for
the
purpose
of
assessment
of
means
for
carer
's
allowance
with
a
view
to
ensure
the
income
of
spouse
,
civil
partner
or
cohabitant
,
where
they
work
overtime
,
will
not
disbar
a
applicant
from
eligibility
for
carer
's
allowance
.
the
minister
will
be
aware
of
the
specific
case
to
which
I
refer
,
even
though
I
have
anonymise
the
detail
.
I
welcome
the
fact
the
minister
will
carry
out
a
review
.
I
take
she
at
she
word
in
that
regard
.
I
acknowledge
the
fact
the
government
have
increase
the
income
disregard
from
€
665
to
€
750
for
a
couple
.
the
scenario
I
be
talk
about
involve
a
couple
where
there
be
two
parent
,
one
of
whom
be
work
while
the
second
forgo
a
career
to
care
for
a
son
or
daughter
and
also
forgo
a
lot
of
opportunity
,
and
do
so
absolutely
willingly
.
the
person
then
find
that
because
they
be
lock
out
of
the
system
and
because
of
a
increase
in
income
due
to
overtime
,
all
other
benefit
accrue
to
the
family
be
lose
.
it
be
that
small
exception
in
scheme
that
we
be
speak
to
here
.
a
small
number
of
couple
throughout
the
country
be
affect
by
this
.
it
be
to
be
hope
they
will
be
include
in
any
review
that
the
minister
undertake
.
the
incremental
,
but
substantial
,
improvement
make
under
the
minister
's
mandate
be
acknowledge
.
the
scenario
I
be
talk
about
be
where
a
spouse
have
to
work
all
of
the
hour
God
give
they
to
bring
income
into
a
family
while
they
spouse
be
care
for
a
person
,
but
all
of
a
sudden
the
income
be
gone
.
it
put
tremendous
pressure
on
the
family
.
if
something
could
be
do
in
respect
of
the
income
disregard
I
would
welcome
that
.
I
would
be
happy
to
furnish
the
minister
with
further
detail
of
this
particular
family
's
circumstance
in
the
context
of
the
review
she
will
carry
out
,
with
a
view
to
she
potentially
consider
that
family
's
scenario
.
I
be
sure
it
be
typical
of
many
scenario
throughout
the
country
.
the
minister
be
in
government
.
I
thank
a
Cathaoirleach
Gníomhach
for
let
I
in
.
I
have
two
simple
question
.
could
that
potentially
apply
to
somebody
who
be
care
for
somebody
for
a
period
and
be
eligible
for
carer
's
allowance
,
for
example
,
where
a
person
have
a
intellectual
disability
in
the
first
instance
and
second
,
where
a
domiciliary
care
allowance
might
have
apply
in
the
lifetime
of
a
carer
?
will
the
minister
outline
in
tabular
form
the
number
of
application
receive
in
2022
for
disability
allowance
,
domiciliary
care
allowance
and
carer
's
allowance
,
the
number
that
be
award
,
and
the
number
of
application
under
appeal
?
I
will
not
have
sight
of
that
as
we
be
here
,
but
I
will
have
sight
of
that
in
the
reply
late
on
.
I
welcome
the
comprehensive
set
of
figure
there
,
but
it
be
glaring
that
across
disability
allowance
,
domiciliary
care
allowance
,
and
carer
's
allowance
application
,
there
be
approximately
5000
appeal
for
disability
allowance
,
2000
appeal
for
domiciliary
care
allowance
,
and
3500
for
carer
's
allowance
.
I
have
pose
the
question
because
if
there
be
a
way
of
further
streamline
the
process
,
particularly
for
parent
where
application
be
make
for
domiciliary
care
allowance
,
this
would
be
very
helpful
.
this
be
on
the
basis
that
the
weight
of
medical
evidence
that
must
be
supply
be
burdensome
.
person
understand
they
have
to
do
it
,
and
obviously
we
must
have
check
and
balance
to
ensure
the
scheme
deliver
what
it
be
suppose
to
deliver
.
nobody
argue
against
that
.
however
,
when
a
decision
be
make
by
a
Department
's
decide
medical
officer
,
very
often
it
pose
question
as
to
the
legitimacy
of
that
decision
.
give
the
weight
of
the
medical
evidence
that
have
be
submit
,
people
feel
understandably
annoyed
where
they
initial
application
be
turn
down
and
,
in
many
case
,
the
decision
be
overturn
on
appeal
.
there
be
still
quite
a
number
that
do
not
reach
oral
hearing
level
.
with
the
domiciliary
care
allowance
in
particular
,
the
fact
that
2000
application
have
go
to
appeal
have
to
tell
we
something
about
the
system
and
whether
it
be
work
.
what
we
have
be
a
situation
where
one
consultant
or
medical
professional
be
overturn
the
decision
of
another
.
this
,
effectively
,
be
what
be
happen
when
the
medical
examiner
look
at
the
case
.
for
example
,
I
go
to
my
consultant
who
know
I
,
have
a
relationship
with
I
and
completely
understand
the
nature
of
my
complaint
.
that
could
then
be
overturn
by
somebody
who
never
meet
the
applicant
,
who
never
interact
with
the
applicant
and
who
be
make
a
decision
against
the
applicant
.
it
have
always
be
thus
,
and
maybe
it
be
time
for
we
,
give
that
the
minister
be
reform
in
nature
,
perhaps
to
look
at
this
again
.
there
be
three
very
particular
scheme
for
which
thousand
of
people
make
application
where
decision
be
make
on
medical
grounds
on
the
basis
of
what
be
arguably
a
desktop
exercise
.
if
the
minister
see
fit
to
look
at
that
again
and
perhaps
review
it
,
that
would
be
very
helpful
.

please
proceed
.
I
remind
colleague
that
this
business
must
conclude
at
6.09
p.m
.
there
be
three
speaker
offer
.
I
call
deputy
McNamara
.
I
support
the
motion
.
the
Labour
Party
have
be
lead
the
way
regard
what
we
perceive
to
be
the
reduction
or
diminution
in
community
welfare
officer
service
at
the
most
local
level
for
a
long
time
now
.
while
many
people
will
easily
interact
with
a
freephone
number
and
that
will
capture
perhaps
a
new
audience
,
many
vulnerable
people
live
in
rural
area
will
not
have
the
wherewithal
to
go
to
local
Intreo
office
.
I
continue
to
make
this
case
to
the
minister
and
ask
that
this
be
look
at
again
.
we
need
to
bring
the
service
to
as
many
people
as
possible
.
we
have
all
quote
countless
example
to
she
of
what
we
perceive
to
be
a
creep
centralisation
of
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
.
that
scheme
be
enshrine
in
legislation
for
a
reason
,
which
be
that
it
would
allow
for
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
local
community
welfare
officer
.
we
feel
there
be
a
departmental
policy
now
to
try
to
squeeze
that
as
much
as
possible
.
the
minister
will
say
a
increase
of
approximately
€
17
million
have
be
pay
out
in
additional
need
.
I
be
never
aware
of
such
a
specific
scheme
set
out
in
statute
call
a
additional
need
scheme
.
I
always
understand
it
to
be
a
exceptional
need
payment
and
urgent
need
payment
scheme
.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
additional
€
17
million
have
be
pay
out
,
which
be
acknowledge
,
the
number
of
recipient
have
go
up
to
97000
.
I
believe
strongly
that
be
a
suppress
demand
.
what
I
mean
by
this
be
that
if
more
people
know
the
service
exist
,
they
would
come
in
to
avail
of
it
.
many
people
still
do
not
know
the
service
exist
.
we
have
evidence
that
where
people
have
try
to
engage
with
the
service
,
they
have
find
it
to
be
cumbersome
and
overly
bureaucratic
.
that
have
be
the
experience
in
my
constituency
office
.
that
should
be
make
simple
and
more
seamless
.
the
minister
will
say
that
people
have
the
right
to
be
visit
in
they
home
and
the
right
to
engage
on
a
face
-
to
-
face
level
.
if
there
be
more
of
that
in
the
community
at
the
most
rural
and
local
level
,
and
not
necessarily
house
in
or
funnel
through
the
Intreo
office
,
that
would
capture
many
more
people
in
dire
need
at
the
moment
.
I
speak
not
just
specifically
for
the
people
who
would
have
be
recipient
on
a
repeat
basis
for
such
payment
but
the
new
working
poor
who
be
on
fix
income
and
whose
mortgage
and
fuel
cost
have
increase
.
while
they
be
on
fix
income
,
they
be
not
able
to
meet
the
additional
need
in
a
house
and
additional
expense
that
arise
.
I
ask
the
minister
and
government
to
take
this
into
account
when
be
consider
any
proposal
.
the
word
"
wean
"
have
be
use
in
government
circle
.
the
government
be
talk
about
wean
people
off
cost
-
of
-
living
measure
in
the
come
week
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
examine
the
evidence
base
in
the
government
's
own
figure
,
which
be
supply
to
I
in
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
and
show
that
97000
applicant
avail
of
more
than
€
58.2
million
in
additional
or
exceptional
need
payment
.
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
be
the
jewel
in
the
crown
that
ensure
people
do
not
fall
below
a
certain
floor
and
that
protection
be
in
place
for
the
most
vulnerable
when
they
be
need
.
thank
goodness
we
live
in
this
State
and
that
we
provide
this
when
we
consider
other
example
around
the
world
where
there
be
no
such
support
.
I
believe
strongly
,
though
,
that
we
have
to
consider
the
evidence
that
be
come
forward
to
we
from
ngo
and
voluntary
body
.
again
,
the
evidence
be
come
from
this
house
through
testimonial
by
individual
deputy
who
report
back
to
the
minister
on
case
with
which
we
be
deal
.
we
need
to
ensure
there
be
a
protection
of
basic
social
welfare
payment
.
there
be
definitely
a
need
to
ensure
there
be
a
increase
to
meet
the
additional
cost
-
of
-
living
increase
.
if
we
think
about
the
fact
that
in
2022
,
€
5.7
million
be
spend
on
clothing
,
€
6.6
million
on
funeral
cost
,
€
1.8
million
on
household
bill
and
more
than
€
7.5
million
on
general
expense
under
this
scheme
,
base
on
the
criterion
for
pay
somebody
,
there
be
a
clear
evidence
base
there
that
that
scheme
be
vital
and
necessary
.
they
need
to
continue
and
they
can
not
be
cut
back
.
this
argument
of
wean
people
off
be
a
very
unfortunate
use
of
language
by
government
.
it
be
very
right
wing
and
it
demean
people
.
this
be
work
people
in
the
main
who
need
this
payment
because
they
be
on
fix
income
.
I
be
not
direct
this
at
the
minister
.
let
I
be
very
clear
about
that
.
this
idea
of
taper
down
payment
at
a
time
when
there
be
clearly
a
cost
-
of
-
living
crisis
have
be
use
in
other
government
circle
,
however
.
the
evidence
from
the
minister
's
own
figure
,
as
supply
to
we
in
reply
to
parliamentary
question
,
be
that
there
be
a
clear
need
for
this
supplementary
welfare
allowance
payment
.
there
be
a
very
clear
evidence
base
for
they
to
continue
.
I
would
hope
that
they
will
continue
and
that
there
will
be
no
effort
to
wean
people
off
.
I
will
return
to
what
I
perceive
to
be
the
creep
centralisation
of
service
within
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
I
be
not
ask
for
the
wheel
to
be
reinvent
.
I
be
merely
ask
that
the
minister
go
back
to
the
well
.
the
well
spring
be
always
a
department
that
go
out
to
the
people
to
provide
the
service
to
they
.
it
form
relationship
with
people
on
the
ground
.
community
welfare
officer
know
the
person
with
whom
they
be
deal
.
they
know
they
context
and
be
able
to
make
decision
in
a
very
quick
time
.
if
,
for
instance
,
I
be
advocate
to
a
community
welfare
officer
on
behalf
of
a
constituent
,
we
have
that
relationship
.
thankfully
,
in
some
part
of
my
constituency
,
we
still
have
that
relationship
,
and
I
be
very
grateful
for
it
.
we
have
excellent
community
welfare
officer
.
if
,
for
instance
,
a
piece
of
documentation
or
evidence
be
missing
that
would
meet
the
criterion
to
pay
somebody
,
that
could
be
easily
sort
.
the
person
could
be
put
into
payment
quickly
and
then
come
back
the
next
day
with
the
document
and
everything
would
be
sort
.
now
,
there
be
too
many
hurdle
for
the
individual
applicant
to
cross
because
the
relationship
between
the
applicant
and
the
system
have
become
disjointed
in
a
way
that
the
person
to
whom
the
application
be
make
do
not
have
that
direct
relationship
.
we
need
to
go
back
to
that
.
that
should
be
a
easy
thing
to
do
and
resurrect
.
it
be
on
that
basis
that
we
support
the
motion
.
however
,
we
will
continue
to
lobby
for
a
proper
fit
-
for
-
purpose
community
welfare
officer
system
and
supplementary
welfare
allowance
system
that
do
not
take
the
service
away
in
a
qualitative
sense
from
the
client
.
this
be
a
customer
-
face
Department
and
it
must
continue
to
be
one
.
I
hear
the
deputy
loud
and
clear
.
he
want
St.
Fergal
's
College
,
Rathdowney
,
to
be
provide
with
a
PE
hall
in
the
interest
of
equity
and
he
want
I
to
take
that
message
back
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Foley
.
I
will
do
that
.
the
current
situation
be
that
the
exist
additional
school
accommodation
scheme
do
not
include
provision
for
PE
hall
and
yet
the
national

be
a

100

.
in

of
the

develop

the

will
be

not

I

and
that
it

this

plenty
of

the

do

be
good

rather

that
that
be

the
minister
have
previously
address
this
but
I
want
to
raise
again
the
issue
of
access
to
ophthalmology
service
in
the
CHO
4
region
,
which
cover
County
Kerry
,
north
Cork
,
north
Lee
,
south
Lee
and
west
Cork
,
which
be
present
challenge
.
more
than
€
200000
have
be
spend
on
private
provider
in
this
area
in
the
past
while
and
more
than
3000
child
be
still
wait
for
ophthalmology
intervention
in
the
area
.
it
appear
that
recruitment
continue
to
be
a
significant
issue
.
on
2
December
2022
I
receive
correspondence
from
the
South
/
SouthWest
Hospital
Group
on
foot
of
representation
I
make
by
way
of
a
parliamentary
question
,
where
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
,
deputy
Stephen
Donnelly
,
the
number
of
staff
,
the
grade
and
the
length
of
service
of
each
member
currently
assign
to
ophthalmology
service
across
Cork
hospital
and
the
number
of
vacancy
in
the
same
hospital
.
I
be
tell
that
there
be
approximately
39
whole
-
time
equivalent
in
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
but
that
the
number
of
vacancy
for
whole
-
time
equivalent
be
two
.
for
South
Infirmary
Victoria
University
Hospital
,
SIVUH
,
it
be
25
with
a
vacancy
rate
there
of
2.7
whole
-
time
equivalent
while
in
the
Mercy
University
Hospital
,
MUH
,
the
number
that
come
back
be
zero
.
the
minister
tell
I
that
the
South
/
SouthWest
Hospital
Group
have
advise
that
it
"
expect
the
new
operating
theatre
will
be
open
in
March
2023
"
.
will
the
€
5
million
ophthalmology
unit
will
become
operational
in
March
,
as
have
be
articulate
in
the
past
?
what
comfort
can
the
minister
of
State
give
to
that
people
who
be
seek
to
access
public
service
now
that
the
require
number
of
vacancy
will
be
fill
?
I
fully
appreciate
that
the
HSE
will
spend
considerable
amount
of
taxpayer
's
money
on
waiting
list
initiative
but
the
cost
to
the
Exchequer
of
wait
list
initiative
be
increase
dramatically
.
in
November
2021
,
39
patient
be
refer
to
one
of
this
list
at
a
cost
of
€
15000
while
in
June
last
year
,
559
patient
be
refer
to
a
private
company
at
a
cost
of
€
83000
.
if
we
want
to
get
people
through
the
list
,
that
be
fine
and
I
do
not
think
anybody
have
any
issue
with
that
but
be
not
good
value
for
money
when
we
have
a
unit
cost
€
5
million
that
be
suppose
to
be
for
public
service
sit
there
and
there
be
still
recruitment
issue
into
the
public
service
.
we
do
not
want
to
see
a
continuation
of
a
wait
list
initiative
by
private
provider
when
it
can
be
do
through
the
public
realm
.
it
all
boil
down
to
the
3022
child
wait
for
ophthalmology
intervention
I
represent
.
that
be
a
significant
number
.
I
seek
comfort
from
the
Minister
of
State
that
what
the
taxpayer
have
invest
in
will
become
operational
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
send
a
message
back
to
the
machine
and
the
system
.
I
appreciate
that
.
I
also
appreciate
the
fact
that
she
be
take
this
issue
on
behalf
of
the
minister
and
answer
be
not
always
readily
provide
to
she
.
I
take
some
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
building
in
Ballincollig
be
operational
and
ready
for
equip
to
deliver
the
integrate
eye
care
service
.
that
give
I
grounds
for
some
hope
.
however
,
there
seem
to
be
a
juxtaposition
in
the
reply
because
the
Minister
of
State
's
next
sentence
mention
that
the
integrate
eye
care
service
"
await
funding
approval
from
the
HSE
"
.
she
also
say
the
stakeholder
be
meet
tomorrow
.
I
be
not
direct
this
at
she
per
se
but
in
she
reply
,
she
say
the
building
in
Ballincollig
be
operational
and
ready
for
equip
.
I
need
to
know
if
it
be
go
to
be
fully
fund
.
the
ophthalmology
unit
base
in
SIVUH
,
which
cost
€
5
million
,
be
not
operational
.
I
need
some
comfort
for
the
people
I
represent
in
the
CHO
4
area
in
order
that
I
can
assure
they
there
will
be
seamless
access
to
service
,
whether
on
a
community
basis
or
at
consultant
level
.
the
Minister
of
State
make
reference
to
the
involvement
of
community
.
there
be
great
scope
for
community
optician
to
become
involved
in
all
of
this
but
what
they
be
tell
I
be
that
the
€
23
they
get
per
medical
card
patient
be
not
worth
they
while
,
give
the
associate
administrative
burden
.
some
people
be
leave
the
system
.
if
we
be
talk
about
a
front
-
door
system
,
where
the
front
door
be
a
gp
or
community
optician
,
we
must
make
it
financially
viable
for
community
optician
to
be
able
to
deliver
more
.
they
cannot
do
that
at
€
23
per
patient
because
it
do
not
reflect
the
cost
of
provide
the
service
.
the
Taoiseach
be
depart
from
he
usual
practice
.
it
be
a
mini-budget
.
I
be
very
happy
to
facilitate
colleague
.
if
they
have
a
system
agree
among
themselves
,
I
be
very
happy
to
facilitate
that
.
that
be
okay
.
in
that
spirit
of
collegiality
,
could
I
take
a
view
from
the
Member
as
to
whether
we
can
move
on

I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
to
the
committee
.
most
of
my
question
have
already
be
cover
by
deputy
Sheahan
so
there
be
no
point
in
my
repeat
they
.
however
,
I
be
interested
in
the
statement
make
by
Commissioner
Borg
to
the
fishery
committee
of
the
European
Parliament
on
10
February
that
the
Hague
preference
would
be
open
for
negotiation
.
in
term
of
fishery
policy
,
it
seem
the
Irish
voice
at
the
European
Council
be
weak
to
begin
with
and
we
have
be
on
the
back
foot
ever
since
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
sense
from
the
Minister
of
State
of
whether
,
with
the
review
which
be
to
take
place
in
2012
,
there
will
be
a
strengthening
of
Irish
fishery
and
they
economic
potential
,
or
whether
it
will
be
the
usual
negotiation
for
the
low
common
denominator
.
be
there
potential
for
growth
in
real
term
?
I
would
also
like
to
hear
the
Minister
of
State
speak
more
about
the
potential
for
aquaculture
.
have
read
the
report
about
the
seminar
that
take
place
in
Kenmare
on
19
March
,
I
can
see
there
be
massive
potential
for
job
growth
in
this
sector
.
I
would
like
to
hear
how
that
would
be
bring
about
in
real
term
.
in
term
of
marketing
initiative
,
I
can
see
how
the
European
Seafood
Exposition
could
yield
result
,
but
such
initiative
have
be
ongoing
for
year
.
BIM
have
be
strong
in
term
of
market
Irish
fishing
,
but
there
seem
to
be
a
status
quo
.
be
there
new
initiative
which
will
seek
to
corner
a
great
percentage
of
the
export
market
from
the
point
of
view
of
aquaculture
and
sea-fishery
?
with
regard
to
the
percentage
share
hold
by
each
member
state
,
the
minister
state
they
have
generally
remain
the
same
for
more
than
20
year
under
the
principle
of
relative
stability
.
I
do
not
know
exactly
what
this
principle
mean
,
although
I
have
a
idea
of
what
it
might
mean
,
but
perhaps
the
minister
of
State
could
discuss
that
further
.
the
Minister
of
State
do
not
refer
to
the
future
of
eel
fishing
in
he
statement
.
I
would
like
he
to
elaborate
on
this
.
be
there
a
future
for
eel
fishing
in
this
country
?
be
it
come
under
threat
at
present
?
what
be
the
minister
of
State
's
view
?
on
behalf
of
the
joint
committee
,
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
he
official
for
attend
.
I
thank
he
for
he
comprehensive
presentation
and
answer
question
.
I
be
glad
he
have
indicate
that
he
will
come
back
to
we
if
there
be
further
news
.
it
be
great
to
see
he
back
in
full
fettle
after
he
recent
illness
.
no
,
thank
you
.
I
wish
to
come
back
to
financing
and
scalability
,
which
be
the
two
element
to
this
that
I
can
discern
.
if
question
about
finance
have
already
be
ask
and
answer
-----
how
can
we
get
bank
and
credit
union
to
finance
this
opportunity
for
people
live
in
typical
1970
bungalow
?
such
people
might
have
some
savings
and
can
benefit
from
the
SEAI
grant
.
however
,
they
still
fall
short
of
the
a
cost
of
a
deep
retrofit
or
a
good
energy
solution
.
how
do
we
fill
that
final
piece
of
the
pie
?
I
have
not
be
able
to
figure
that
out
.
the
credit
union
movement
and
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
have
talk
about
get
into
this
space
.
I
imagine
the
bank
could
not
care
less
about
this
space
.
however
,
relatively
small
loan
could
be
scale
up
to
achieve
a
lot
.
that
be
the
first
question
.
yes
,
please
.
I
appreciate
that
.
there
be
more
work
to
be
do
around
financing
but
at
least
we
can
take
some
empirical
model
from
the
SEAI
research
.
I
welcome
Mr.
Tom
Parlon
back
to
the
House
,
if
that
have
not
be
do
already
.
I
be
sure
it
have
.
I
refer
to
part
L
of
the
building
regulation
and
the
skill
set
need
for
retrofit
.
a
finite
pool
of
labour
be
available
for
construction
in
Ireland
at
present
but
that
be
go
to
ramp
up
.
I
have
a
two
-
part
question
.
first
,
how
will
the
Construction
Industry
Federation
,
CIF
,
and
other
train
the
type
of
people
the
Tipperary
Energy
Agency
be
supply
in
order
to
meet
the
demand
?
as
I
say
at
the
outset
,
for
efficiency
's
sake
if
my
question
have
be
answer
already
the
witness
need
not
answer
they
.
the
second
question
concern
part
L
of
the
building
regulation
.
we
have
discuss
nearly
zero
energy
building
.
what
be
the
energy
fit
in
this
building
?
be
it
boiler
,
advanced
boiler
or
heat
exchanger
?
what
be
the
CIF
's
interpretation
of
part
L
for
new
build
?
my
fear
be
that
solar
and
heat
exchanger
might
not
be
part
of
it
.
be
there
any
thinking
within
CIF
on
that
?
that
be
the
challenge
.
we
be
now
go
to
load
the
grid
.
we
will
effectively
use
fossil
fuel
to
add
more
power
to
the
grid
to
meet
the
target
from
a
building
perspective
.
at
the
same
time
,
there
will
be
a
exponential
increase
in
the
amount
of
fossil
fuel
we
use
to
keep
the
grid
go
.
I
be
play
devil
's
advocate
now
-----

I
thank
the
chairman
for
afford
I
the
opportunity
to
join
the
committee
today
.
this
debate
have
be
really
useful
and
prove
to
be
a
very
useful
tutorial
for
somebody
such
as
myself
.
on
the
role
of
local
authority
,
in
the
wording
of
the
legislation
be
there
insufficient
direction
give
to
local
authority
on
the
interpretation
of
national
climate
action
plan
and
how
they
translate
at
the
most
local
level
into
adaptation
and
mitigation
measure
?
do
either
witness
have
a
view
on
the
role
of
local
authority
?
do
the
wording
need
to
be
buttress
or
tighten
up
?
I
see
a
role
for
local
authority
.
Transport
and
housing
be
two
key
element
of
take
carbon
out
of
the
equation
so
the
role
of
local
authority
would
be
important
.
slightly
tangential
to
that
be
the
role
of
public
participation
.
if
there
be
a
facility
for
local
authority
to
invite
member
of
the
public
to
make
submission
then
that
could
be
a
opportunity
for
the
citizen
to
engage
at
the
most
local
level
.
can
consideration
be
give
to
tighten
up
the
wording
?
do
the
witness
have
a
perspective
on
the
wording
?
we
have
a
climate
change
advisory
committee
and
there
be
the
committee
on
Climate
Change
in
the
UK
.
let
I
explain
the
way
I
look
at
the
Irish
committee
.
the
Professor
John
FitzGeralds
of
this
world
keep
we
honest
.
by
that
I
mean
,
when
they
talk
people
listen
because
they
do
not
have
a
"
political
"
agenda
.
to
what
extent
do
the
UK
House
of
Parliament
view
the
UK
Committee
on
Climate
Change
?
do
it
have
a
real
beneficial
impact
in
term
of
influence
policymaker
and
government
?
can
we
learn
form
the
UK
experience
?
can
we
translate
the
lesson
learn
into
a
legislative
text
here
that
give
great
weight
to
the
Irish
climate
change
advisory
committee
such
that
it
have
more
power
,
good
power
of
intervention
and
the
power
of
persuasion
?
my
question
be
more
philosophical
but
the
witness
might
have
perspective
on
they
.
finally
,
I
thank
both
of
the
witness
for
they
submission
to
the
committee
.
if
the
witness
can
send
in
they
observation
in
writing
regard
the
question
of
offset
,
we
would
welcome
that
.
we
will
resume
we
pre-legislative
scrutiny
of
the
climate
Bill
tomorrow
morning
.
I
welcome
Ms
Doyle
and
she
colleague
to
the
committee
.
what
be
the
surplus
income
this
year
and
for
what
be
it
be
use
?
be
part
of
the
surplus
income
use
to
produce
the
booklet
present
before
this
committee
today
?
I
receive
a
copy
of
the
proposal
and
the
presentation
by
e-mail
and
do
not
understand
,
therefore
,
give
the
time
we
be
in
,
how
anybody
could
justify
a
spend
on
a
elaborate
,
glossy
presentation
such
as
the
one
we
have
here
.
I
do
not
want
to
sound
'
holy
than
thou
'
about
it
,
but
we
be
all
attuned
to
electronic
media
and
I
find
this
ridiculous
.
Ms
Doyle
state
a
"
equilibrium
"
of
25811
licence
have
be
reach
.
how
do
she
ascertain
we
have
reach
a
equilibrium
level
,
particularly
when
countless
number
of
taxi
driver
say
there
be
over
supply
of
licence
in
the
market
?
she
acknowledge
that
between
2005
and
2008
real
income
reduce
by
5
%
and
say
there
have
be
a
further
reduction
since
2008
.
I
represent
a
constituency
with
a
urban
rural
mix
,
and
give
the
number
of
taxi
driver
who
approach
I
with
query
as
to
how
they
can
obtain
supplementary
welfare
income
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
in
lieu
of
income
they
be
no
long
earn
,
I
suggest
the
reduction
in
income
be
far
more
stark
than
5
%
or
whatever
the
current
figure
be
on
reduction
in
earnings
.
the
key
issue
be
that
taxi
driver
with
a
licence
be
no
long
make
a
living
out
of
they
licence
.
if
I
be
to
speak
for
driver
in
small
town
like
Mallow
,
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
,
I
would
suggest
there
be
a
over
-
supply
of
licence
within
regional
area
outside
of
the
large
metropolitan
area
and
that
the
driver
be
not
able
to
make
a
living
.
perhaps
the
point
be
that
it
be
not
they
divine
right
to
earn
a
living
from
taxi
driving
,
but
if
there
be
some
control
or
great
control
over
the
number
of
licence
issue
full
-
time
driver
who
be
try
to
put
food
on
the
table
might
be
able
to
make
some
kind
of
living
without
have
to
supplement
they
income
with
income
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
what
be
the
delegate
's
view
on
this
?
I
understand
the
Competition
Authority
will
have
a
separate
view
on
licence
number
and
competition
but
I
fail
to
see
how
the
Taxi
Regulator
can
say
we
have
reach
equilibrium
.
I
hope
I
do
not
misunderstand
the
regulator
in
this
regard
.
reference
be
make
to
regulatory
impact
analysis
.
what
be
involved
in
the
regulatory
impact
analysis
of
25,000
licence
in
term
of
the
ability
of
the
driver
to
make
a
living
?
be
the
latter
factor
in
?
the
regulator
state
she
have
carry
out
study
on
real
earnings
.
if
so
,
she
be
consider
sociological
aspect
or
the
economic
cost
of
have
a
over
-
supply
of
licence
or
a
set
supply
of
licence
.
do
the
regulatory
impact
analysis
take
into
account
the
qualitative
cost
to
individual
licensee
of
have
so
many
licence
in
the
market
at
present
?
I
acknowledge
we
be
experience
a
economic
downturn
and
that
there
may
be
a
downturn
in
business
between
Thursday
to
Saturday
night
.
in
my
town
,
Mallow
,
for
instance
,
40
or
50
licence
holder
ply
for
trade
on
a
relatively
small
rank
on
a
Thursday
afternoon
.
it
be
ridiculous
and
not
sustainable
.
where
do
one
draw
the
line
?
do
one
continue
to
say
that
any
applicant
who
fulfil
all
the
criterion
should
get
a
licence
or
do
one
say
that
a
town
such
as
Mallow
have
enough
licence
and
that
no
more
should
be
issue
?
this
apply
to
every
town
of
Mallow
's
size
.
be
it
print
externally
?
how
much
do
it
cost
?
what
do
that
mean
?
Ms
Doyle
state
the
regulatory
impact
be
control
over
number
through
the
establishment
of
rule
to
modify
behaviour
.
the
Taxi
Regulator
will
continue
to
regulate
the
industry
.
although
there
be
a
dip
in
number
at
present
,
they
will
probably
increase
in
the
long
term
.
something
will
have
to
give
at
some
stage
.
the
current
number
be
not
sustainable
.
nobody
want
a
close
shop
in
the
taxi
industry
.
while
there
should
be
equilibrium
between
supply
and
demand
,
the
regulator
be
refer
to
a
false
equilibrium
because
the
number
of
driver

I

to
discuss
the
propose
resolution
from
the
Dáil
and
Seanad
approve
the
draft
of
the
order
which
I
will
be
propose
.
the
order
seek
to
reserve
32
place
in
the
first
year
of
the
bachelor
of
Education
degree
course
in
the
Church
of
Ireland
College
of
Education
,
Rathmine
,
for
student
who
be
member
of
the
Church
of
Ireland
or
belong
to
the
broad
Protestant
tradition
.
the
making
of
the
order
and
its
laying
before
the
House
arise
from
the
provision
of
the
employment
Equality
Act
1998
and
be
design
to
ensure
that
the
rights
and
interest
of
college
and
school
with
a
Protestant
etho
and
the
student
of
that
school
be
provide
for
.
the
employment
Equality
Act
1998
prohibit
discrimination
on
a
wide
-
range
of
grounds
,
include
religion
.
while
the
act
deal
primarily
with
discrimination
in
employment
it
also
extend
to
discrimination
in
vocational
training
.
vocational
training
be
define
as
any
system
of
instruction
that
enable
a
person
to
acquire
the
knowledge
for
the
carry
of
a
occupational
activity
.
teacher
-
training
fall
within
this
definition
.
for
many
year
,
the
Church
of
Ireland
College
of
Education
have
provide
training
in
primary
school
teaching
only
to
student
who
come
from
the
Church
of
Ireland
and
the
broad
Protestant
tradition
.
the
purpose
of
this
practise
be
to
ensure
that
there
be
available
to
school
under
Protestant
ownership
a
sufficient
number
of
teacher
who
themselves
come
from
a
Protestant
background
and
be
train
in
a
institution
with
a
Protestant
etho
.
most
primary
school
in
the
State
be
privately
own
,
publicly
fund
denominational
school
.
this
system
of
denominational
education
be
underpin
by
the
constitution
.
Central
to
the
right
of
the
religious
denomination
to
conduct
school
with
a
particular
etho
be
they
need
to
ensure
that
they
have
available
to
they
a
body
of
staff
belong
to
and
train
in
the
particular
religious
denomination
of
the
school
.
if
such
staff
be
not
available
,
the
constitutional
right
to
free
profession
of
religion
and
the
conduct
of
denominational
school
would
be
seriously
impaired
.
to
avoid
impose
what
would
in
effect
be
unconstitutional
restriction
on
the
rights
of
the
religious
denomination
in
this
regard
section
12
of
the
employment
Equality
Act
1998
,
which
prohibit
discrimination
in
vocational
training
,
make
two
exception
.
it
provide
that
the
prohibition
of
discrimination
do
not
apply
for
the
purpose
of
ensure
the
availability
of
nurse
and
teacher
to
denominational
hospital
and
primary
school
respectively
.
in
the
case
of
primary
school
the
section
provide
that
a
educational
or
training
body
may
apply
to
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
for
a
order
permit
the
body
to
reserve
place
on
the
vocational
training
course
.
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
with
the
consent
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
,
Equality
and
Defence
,
may
then
make
a
order
allow
the
body
to
reserve
such
number
of
place
to
meet
the
need
for
teacher
in
primary
school
as
be
consider
appropriate
.
the
Church
of
Ireland
College
of
Education
have
make
a
application
on
behalf
of
the
college
for
the
reservation
of
32
place
in
the
college
for
the
academic
year
2013
-
14
up
to
2017
-
18
for
student
who
be
member
of
recognise
church
in
the
Protestant
tradition
.
the
college
make
the
case
that
the
reservation
of
32
place
,
which
be
currently
the
full
complement
of
first
year
place
in
the
college
,
should
be
make
in
order
to
provide
sufficient
teacher
for
Protestant
school
over
the
next
number
of
year
.
the
grounds
for
the
request
as
put
by
the
college
be
as
follow
:
the
necessity
of
provide
a
sufficient
number
of
qualified
primary
teacher
to
maintain
the
distinctive
etho
of
Protestant
school
remain
the
central
concern
and
motivation
for
seek
the
order
;
primary
school
in
the
Protestant
community
depend
almost
exclusively
on
the
college
for
the
provision
of
a
annual
supply
of
well
qualified
teacher
from
a
Protestant
background
;
a
report
continue
shortage
of
applicant
for
teaching
position
in
Protestant
primary
school
,
particularly
small
school
in
rural
area
;
some
of
that
who
enter
the
college
will
not
complete
they
study
and
of
that
who
qualify
some
will
not
take
up
post
in
school
with
the
Protestant
etho
;
also
,
a
number
of
graduate
go
to
live
and
work
abroad
while
other
engage
in
further
study
.
I
believe
,
in
the
circumstance
set
out
by
the
college
,
the
continue
reservation
of
32
place
in
the
college
for
student
from
the
Protestant
tradition
appear
reasonable
to
ensure
that
Protestant
school
have
available
to
they
a
sufficient
number
of
teacher
who
share
they
value
system
and
religious
belief
.
apart
from
the
constitutional
requirement
from
which
this
order
flow
,
the
order
be
a
necessary
support
for
the
maintenance
of
diversity
of
value
,
belief
and
culture
in
we
education
system
and
Irish
society
.
give
that
school
with
a
Protestant
etho
represent
only
a
small
minority
of
primary
school
in
the
State
,
there
be
clearly
a
risk
that
that
etho
could
be
dilute
unless
specific
protection
be
provide
.
this
order
put
in
place
a
protection
which
the
Oireachtas
consider
appropriate
and
which
will
guarantee
Protestant
school
that
they
can
continue
to
provide
education
for
they
student
in
accordance
with
they
particular
value
and
belief
.
I
acknowledge
that
some
aspect
of
the
environment
in
which
the
Church
of
Ireland
College
of
Education
operate
be
change
.
I
refer
in
this
regard
specifically
to
development
in
relation
to
school
patronage
and
the
work
underway
on
the
restructuring
of
teacher
education
provision
in
Ireland
.
however
,
there
be
a
continue
need
for
this
provision
to
be
make
.
the
primary
legislation
govern
the
order
provide
that
it
may
be
revoke
and
any
effect
of
this
development
on
the
necessity
for
the
order
will
be
keep
under
review
.
I
thank
the
committee
for
its
consideration
of
this
important
issue
,
which
safeguard
and
support
the
maintenance
of
diversity
of
value
,
belief
and
culture
in
we
education
system
and
Irish
society
.
deputy
McConalogue
's
first
question
be
about
place
and
all
32
place
have
be
take
and
it
have
happen
three
time
.
I
do
not
really
understand
the
third
question
and
perhaps
I
misheard
it
.
there
be
a
philosophical
element
in
this
,
I
suppose
,
and
if
I
be
read
the
intervention
by
Deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
,
Collins
and
Bannon
correctly
,
there
seem
to
be
a
issue
with
whether
the
State
should
provide
wholly
for
education
of
primary
and
post
-
primary
level
,
or
if
there
should
be
what
could
loosely
be
call
a
subvention
for
provision
at
school
where
there
be
a
particular
religious
etho
.
we
be
all
aware
of
the
particular
provision
propose
here
,
which
be
to
ensure
we
can
guarantee
the
teaching
etho
through
the
Protestant
tradition
.
we
would
not
necessarily
disagree
with
that
.
speak
personally
,
one
could
argue
that
religious
formation
for
any
citizen
could
take
place
through
a
Sunday
school
mechanism
or
outside
normal
teaching
hour
.
nevertheless
,
the
State
provide
for
a
number
of
hour
,
which
be
probably
a
vagary
of
we
history
of
a
strong
Catholic
etho
with
other
minority
religion
.
the
education
sector
in
Finland
have
97
%
of
school
within
the
state
sector
and
religious
formation
be
extraneous
to
the
process
.
the
majority
of
the
school
be
within
the
public
sphere
.
Ireland
be
a
particular
country
with
a
specific
history
and
tradition
,
so
there
be
a
historical
narrative
in
that
regard
.
it
be
a
question
of
where
we
be
move
.
be
we
look
to
divest
ourselves
of
any
state
intervention
with
school
of
a
particular
etho
?
that
be
a
particular
philosophical
question
with
which
we
must
grapple
.
I
have
a
particular
policy
responsibility
for
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
math
,
and
if
member
be
ask
I
whether
I
believe
we
should
spend
more
time
in
school
teach
in
that
area
than
prepare
for
certain
aspect
of
religious
formation
,
I
know
I
would
prefer
to
invest
the
time
in
teach
core
subject
.
that
be
a
personal
opinion
.
I
sense
from
the
committee
that
there
be
no
difficulty
with
the
provision
be
propose
.
in
response
to
deputy
Bannon
,
there
be
no
different
set
of
rights
.
we
be
recognise
a
minority
etho
and
ensure
it
be
protect
in
term
of
pedagogy
,
teaching
and
ensure
the
supply
of
teacher
,
and
we
be
do
it
in
a
structure
way
.
there
be
a
continue
need
and
not
all
32
graduate
necessarily
end
up
within
the
Protestant
sector
.
some
will
go
to
Educate
together
school
and
some
have
even
go
to
Roman
Catholic
school
.
it
be
about
ensure
the
need
be
meet
on
a
continue
basis
.
that
be
the
fundamental
aspect
of
this
.
the
restructuring
of
teacher
education
college
throw
up
vagary
.
for
example
,
with
regard
to
the
DCU
etho
,
if
one
be
map
-----
there
be
nothing
in
that
which
preclude
anybody
of
a
particular
etho
-----
exactly
.
absolutely
.
fundamentally
,
we
objective
be
to
ensure
that
every
etho
be
provide
for
specifically
.
that
be
the
fundamental
tenet
of
this
provision
.
in
any
restructuring
of
teacher
training
college
,
for
example
,
no
single
entity
or
etho
be
exclude
.
I
believe
that
be
the
point
the
Senator
be
make
.
yes
.
historically
,
teacher
training
be
very
much
align
to
particular
tradition
,
even
within
the
Catholic
etho
.
there
be
vary
tradition
in
distinct
geographical
location
.
personally
,
I
believe
we
must
move
to
a
teacher
training
paradigm
that
be
more
reflective
of
Irish
society
and
more
pluralist
in
its
approach
,
while
ensure
there
be
inherent
guarantee
for
a
minority
etho
that
probably
need
a
certain
protection
.
this
be
evolve
.
as
Irish
society
evolve
,
the
restructuring
of
teacher
training
evolve
.
even
the
debate
about
patronage
be
evolve
.
there
have
never
really
be
a
big
debate
in
Ireland
about
patronage
.
it
be
about
parent
look
at
they
own
religious
belief
and
where
they
want
they
child
to
go
in
term
of
religious
formation
-----
-----
and
have
choice
.
I
hope
I
answer
all
of
the
question
.
I
apologise
if
I
have
not

I

,
particularly

and
he
comment
on

to
retain
access
to
the
single

and

union
be
warmly
welcome
.
I
concur
with
my
fellow
speaker
who
have
say
that
by
any
objective
analysis
,
as
co-ordinator
Mr.
Verhofstadt
have
display
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
dynamic
at
play
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
he
be
right
when
he
say
that
responsibility
for
find
a
solution
to
the
Irish
Border
question
lie
with
the
UK
and
no
realistic
proposal
have
yet
emerge
from
that
quarter
.
my
first
question
be
very
simple
.
will
Mr.
Verhofstadt
and
he
colleague
,
Mr.
Brok
and
Mr.
Gualtieri
,
consider
include
within
the
wording
of
any
final
European
Parliament
resolution
a
clause
that
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
be
maintain
and
the
principle
of
parity
of
esteem
and
human
rights
protection
be
upheld
,
especially
give
that
56
%
of
the
population
in
Northern
Ireland
vote
to
remain
within
the
EU
?
if
no
such
protection
be
forthcoming
from
the
UK
,
will
the
European
Parliament
veto
any
outcome
that
do
not
satisfy
that
fundamental
rights
?
my
second
question
relate
to
a
very
good
article
by
Mr.
Verhofstadt
that
be
publish
in
the
Observer
on
9
July
last
,
in
which
he
write
very
rationally
about
the
UK
position
on
citizen
's
rights
.
he
refer
particularly
to
third
country
national
,
the
new
status
that
will
pertain
in
the
UK
,
the
need
for
separate
application
for
settle
status
and
the
five
-
year
residence
requirement
.
this
be
another
simple
question
.
how
seriously
be
the
European
Parliament
take
the
UK
's
negotiating
position
,
which
be
grossly
insulting
to
any
Irish
person
live
in
the
UK
who
have
settle
there
for
year
and
have
a
intergenerational
relationship
and
which
will
set
back
the
cause
of
Anglo
-
Irish
relation
by
year
?
I
would
like
to
know
Mr.
Verhofstadt
's
opinion
on
that
.
thank
you
very
much
,
a
Chathaoirligh
.
I
welcome
the
commissioner
.
on
19
December
we
Department
of
Finance
issue
a
statement
set
out
some
clear
and
unambiguous
view
relate
to
the
ruling
or
interpretation
of
the
commission
.
I
will
quote
from
the
statement
in
the
context
of
the
various
entity
,
include
Apple
Inc.
,
Apple
sale
International
and
Apple
Operation
Europe
.
I
be
try
to
distil
this
for
people
who
may
not
have
technical
knowledge
,
for
example
,
ordinary
citizen
who
be
watch
the
proceedings
.
on
19
December
the
Department
of
Finance
state
that
the
commission
's
decision
:
the
decision
also
mischaracterise
the
activity
and
responsibility
of
the
Irish
branch
of
ASI
and
AOE
.
this
branch
carry
out
routine
function
,
but
all
important
decision
within
ASI
and
AOE
be
make
in
the
USA
,
and
the
profit
derive
from
this
decision
be
not
properly
attributable
to
the
Irish
branch
of
ASI
and
AOE
.
how
do
the
commissioner
respond
to
that
contention
from
we
Department
of
Finance
?
okay
.
in
the
commission
's
contention
,
where
be
the
intellectual
property
generate
?
how
do
the
commissioner
respond
to
the
view
that
Apple
's
intellectual
property
licence
to
the
Irish
branch
of
Apple
Operation
Europe
and
Apple
sale
International
be
not
consistent
with
Irish
law
?
that
be
the
view
of
we
Department
of
Finance
.
I
would
like
to
return
to
the
issue
of
tax
liability
.
the
commission
have
not
be
silent
on
the
question
of
whether
other
member
state
or
other
country
have
a
call
on
the
magical
figure
of
€
13
billion
.
what
be
the
modality
the
commission
be
propose
for
Ireland
to
set
up
a
system
for
other
country
to
come
call
for
that
€
13
billion
or
a
portion
of
it
?
I
would
like
to
examine
the
statement
the
commissioner
make
to
this
effect
-
if
I
understand
she
correctly
-
when
she
say
other
country
might
have
a
call
on
the
€
13
billion
.
I
have
listen
carefully
to
what
she
have
say
as
a
commissioner
of
the
European
Union
about
the
importance
of
the
single
Market
.
my
view
be
that
if
the
commission
be
to
make
such
a
statement
,
it
must
also
have
a
view
on
how
other
member
state
be
to
collect
this
money
,
if
that
be
what
will
transpire
in
the
final
analysis
.
she
be
too
good
for
deputy
Murphy
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
at
the
joint
committee
meeting
she
attend
recently
,
the
Commissioner
state
:
I
can
say
how
it
look
from
my
side
.
we
do
not
investigate
how
Apple
organised
its
operation
.
we
do
not
investigate
the
cost
-
share
agreement
.
we
do
not
investigate
the
fact
that
Apple
record
its
profit
in
Cork
,
Ireland
.
we
be
look
at
whether
the
allocation
of
profit
be
record
in
the
branch
and
whether
,
therefore
,
it
have
to
be
tax
in
Ireland
,
or
record
in
the
stateless
headquarters
and
,
therefore
,
not
to
be
tax
in
Ireland
.
we
find
that
the
recording
by
Apple
,
which
we
do
not
question
,
could
not
be
support
by
economic
activity
.
that
be
why
they
ought
to
be
record
in
the
branch
of
the
company
that
be
taxable
in
Ireland
.
I
be
try
to
reconcile
,
in
my
own
mind
,
the
statement
make
by
the
Department
of
Finance
on
the
Irish
branch
of
Apple
sale
International
and
Apple
Operation
Europe
.
can
the
minister
give
we
a
opinion
on
the
Commissioner
's
statement
,
particularly
on
the
stateless
headquarters
and
the
activity
level
she
say
be
not
support
by
economic
activity
?
the
Commissioner
go
on
to
say
,
"
we
do
not
investigate
or
value
the
intellectual
property
.
"
if
I
interpret
it
correctly
,
in
deal
with
activity
level
in
Ireland
,
they
be
actually
put
a
value
on
the
intellectual
property
,
or
they
be
at
least
state
it
to
be
economic
activity
.
be
I
wrong
in
this
contention
?
the
kernel
of
the
case
will
be
in
tax
sovereignty
for
the
Irish
people
.
the
base
erosion
and
profit
shift
,
BEPS
,
process
speak
to
that
.
I
also
welcome
the
Revenue
commissioner
.
I
be
try
to
distil
this
.
in
respect
of
the
theme
around
the
methodology
,
the
commission
have
state
that
the
decision
of
30
August
assert
that
the
two
opinion
give
in
1991
and
2007
by
Revenue
renounce
tax
revenue
that
Ireland
would
otherwise
have
be
entitle
to
collect
from
the
Irish
branch
of
Apple
sale
International
,
ASI
,
and
Apple
Operation
Europe
,
AOE
.
Mr.
Cody
speak
of
a
mis-characterisation
.
I
think
that
be
the
word
he
use
in
the
document
we
have
.
will
he
explain
what
he
mean
?
what
be
mean
by
"
renounce
"
in
this
instance
?
correct
I
if
my
mathematics
be
wrong
,
if
the
tax
liability
be
€
13
billion
and
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
the
tax
rate
be
10
%
,
the
economic
activity
be
€
130
billion
,
if
I
be
correct
.
what
the
commission
be
say
be
that
in
this
instance
,
there
be
€
130
billion
worth
of
economic
activity
conduct
on
the
island
of
Ireland
through
two
entity
.
be
that
correct
base
on
that
model
?
that
be
what
it
be
say
.
I
return
to
the
Commissioner
's
comment
when
she
appear
before
the
committee
the
other
day
.
she
say
:
we
be
look
at
whether
the
allocation
of
profit
be
record
in
the
branch
and
whether
,
therefore
,
it
have
to
be
tax
in
Ireland
,
or
record
in
the
stateless
headquarters
and
,
therefore
,
not
to
be
tax
in
Ireland
.
we
find
that
the
recording
by
Apple
,
which
we
do
not
question
,
could
not
be
support
by
economic
activity
.
that
be
why
they
ought
to
be
record
in
the
branch
of
the
company
that
be
taxable
in
Ireland
.
she
go
on
to
state
:
we
do
not
investigate
or
value
the
intellectual
property
.
we
have
not
do
that
here
.
we
have
see
that
Apple
have
organised
itself
with
what
it
refer
to
as
a
cost
-
share
agreement
.
this
mean
that
most
of
the
research
and
development
take
place
at
the
Apple
Inc.
facility
in
Cupertino
.
I
be
try
to
get
my
head
around
this
.
in
Mr.
Cody
's
line
of
argument
,
he
state
that
the
commission
's
attribution
of
Apple
's
intellectual
property
licence
to
the
Irish
branch
of
AOE
and
ASI
be
not
consistent
with
Irish
law
and
,
moreover
,
be
inconsistent
with
the
principle
it
claim
to
apply
,
as
be
its
state
refusal
to
take
into
account
the
activity
of
Apple
Inc
.
there
be
no
reconciliation
between
that
two
statement
.
I
be
try
to
distil
the
contradiction
in
layperson
's
term
.
in
respect
of
the
intellectual
property
piece
,
the
minister
ask
we
to
refer
to
the
phone
and
so
on
be
make
in
China
and
the
intellectual
property
in
Cupertino
.
can
somebody
distill
that
for
I
in
bare
simple
term
?
where
do
the
intellectual
property
piece
fit
into
all
this
if
the
commissioner
be
say
that
the
commission
do
not
investigate
or
value
the
intellectual
property
?
Mr.
Cody
be
say
that
the
intellectual
property
be
not
generate
in
Ireland
.
if
I
be
interpret
the
commissioner
correctly
,
she
be
say
that
the
commission
be
not
investigate
the
intellectual
property
so
,
therefore
,
it
be
not
investigate
a
Irish
operation
in
that
sense
.
how
do
we
reconcile
that
?
how
do
we
get
a
good
understanding
of
that
dynamic
?
do
the
two
opinion
of
1991
and
2007
speak
to
the
issue
of
intellectual
property
?
if
I
understand
Mr.
Cody
's
interaction
with
deputy
Michael
McGrath
correctly
,
the
Revenue
commissioner
would
have
kick
the
tyre
on
the
two
opinion
give
.
do
Revenue
look
at
the
issue
of
intellectual
property
in
that
?
I
have
two
very
simple
technical
question
.
what
be
the
arm
's
-
length
principle
?
why
have
the
commission
apply
it
incorrectly
,
in
Mr.
Cody
's
view
?
who
know
?
I
thank
Mr.
Cody
and
he
colleague

that
.
thank
you
very

,
a
Chathaoirligh

with
regard
to
the
indigenous

,
there
be
many
centre
of

within
the
high

institute
.
ucc
,
for
example
,
be
do
considerable
work
through
food
for
Health
Ireland
,
a
initiative
that
involve
collaboration
between
the
dairy
industry
and
Teagasc
in
Moorepark
in
Fermoy
,
for
instance
.
the
objective
be
to
build
on
extract
value
from

.
much
research
be
be
do
in
this
regard
.
there
be
collaboration
between
Teagasc
,
ucc
,
UCD
and
UL
to
determine
how
to
build
functional
food
and
add
nutritional
value
to
food
.
this
work
be
take
place
in
the
indigenous
base
.
NUIG
have
the
Competence
Centre
for
Biorefining
and
Bioenergy
,
which
be
research
second

generation
bio-fuel
.
the
key
component
be
the
Programme
for
Research
in
third
-
Level
Institution
,
PRTLI
,
and
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
which
provide
funding
.
there
be
very
strong
engagement
between
this
body
and
industry
.
in
real
economic
term
,
investment
in
research
allow
this
country
to
compete
with
other
centre
of
excellence
,
include
global
one
such
as
Singapore
,
and
become
a
world
leader
.
it
be
not
often
publicise
that
research
and
collaboration
between
industry
and
the
institute
allow
we
to
support
export
from
we
economy
value
at
approximately
€
73

since

,
foreign
direct
investment
in

,
development

innovation
increase
from
approximately
10
%
to
approximately
50

there
be
a
highly
evolve
realisation
globally
that
the

operate
in

through
collaboration
realise
they
be
able
to
mine
much
more

and
that
this
be
add
to
we
export
base
.
however
,
we
must
continue
to
invest
because
,
if
investment
slip
,
we
could
signal
to
the
rest
of
the
world
that
Ireland
be
take
its
foot
off
the
pedal
in
term
of
investment
in
very
high
-
level
research
.
there
be
a
logical
component
that
ensure
we
can
support
between
72000
and
78000
job
.
we
need
to
continue
on
that
trajectory
.
in
other
word
,
a
large
component
of
FDI
be
predicate
on
ensure
that
basic
and
apply
research
be
there
and
that
we
have
the
requisite
competent
centre
.
we
have
28
competent
centre
of
excellence
in
various
scientific
field
.
we
have
the
Irish
Centre
for
Manufacturing
Research
and
the
Tyndall
Centre
in
ucc
,
which
be
a
competent
centre
for
micro-electronic
.
in
addition
,
there
be
a
competence
centre
at
NUI
Maynooth
for
it
and
innovation
,
which
be
well
support
by
company
such
as
Intel
Labs
.
there
be
a
strong
collaboration
in
evidence
there
and
,
in
that
sense
,
we
be
continue
to
push
out
the
boundary
.
I
profess
to
have
be
ignorant
of
this
field
when
I
be
in
opposition
.
now
that
I
be
in
government
,
once
one
delve
into
this
,
one
realise
that
it
be
understld
as
a
concept
.
the
deep
collaboration
between
research
and
industry
be
a
good
news
story
because
of
the
number
of
job
it
support
and
the
export
it
generate
.
we
would
not
generate
so
many
export
,
with
a
net
value
of
€
73
billion
,
if
we
do
not
have
this
competence
centre
and
the
world
-
class
researcher
we
be
able
to
attract
to
this
country
.
I
hope
that
answer
the
question
.
I
want
to
address
one
aspect
of
Senator
Kathryn
Reilly
's
question
on
commercialisation
.
each
institute
or
university
competence
centre
have
a
technology
transfer
office
which
seek
to
facilitate
commercialisation
of
research
.
couple
with
that
,
the
State
be
seek
to
prioritise
that
area
of
research
for
which
we
can
create
the
necessary
job
,
thus
focus
on
the
require
research
area
.
that
prioritisation
exercise
be
currently
ongoing
.
Enterprise
Ireland
have
a
presence
in
all
the
BRIC
country
and
the
technological
component
of
that
would
be
as
integral
as
any
another
sector
within
the
economy
.
very
often
,
intellectual
property
,
which
be
valuable
and
might
form
part
of
a
large
innovation
,
be
create
and
the
key
for
we
be
how
to
commercialise
that
research
and
add
value
to
that
who
create
it
.
sometimes
that
give
rise
to
the
creation
of
a
spin
out
company
.
a
total
of
31
such
company
be
create
through
the
high
education
institute
in
2010
but
some
of
the
ip
create
add
value
to
the
Intels
or
HPs
of
the
world
,
which
have
a
presence
in
the
country
and
which
be
collaborate
with
the
researcher
through
they
involvement
in
the
high
education
institute
.
it
be
a
multifaceted
approach
.
we
challenge
be
to
get
more
spin
out
from
Irish
university
and
institute
of
technology
and
to
create
the
right
framework
to
ensure
any
research
or
intellectual
property
create
will
add
value
to
Ireland
Incorporated
.
technology
transfer
office
have
a
key
role
in
this
.
most
importantly
,
the
very
fact
that
this
blue
-
chip
company
interface
with
Irish
university
and
institute
of
technology
through
research
collaboration
to
create
intellectual
property
ensure
we
can
continue
to
retain
that
investment
in
the
country
.
we
can
also
grow
it
because
this
company
return
to
they
parent
company
with
the
good
news
story
of
the
research
component
,
as
the
intellectual
property
add
value
to
the
parent
company
's
stock
or
portfolio
.
we
will
maintain
this
route
and
trajectory
but
we
must
also
meet
the
challenge
of
try
to
get
more
indigenous
spin-out
.
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
and
the
work
of
Jim
O'Hara
on
the
innovation
task
force
be
part
of
this
and
it
continue
apace
.
I
be
not
sure
one
can
one
put
a
stricture
that
intellectual
property
remain
in
the
country
where
it
have
be
create
by
a
researcher
in
a
centre
of
excellence
in
collaboration
with
a
international
company
operate
in
Ireland
.
the
market
be
involved
in
this
in
term
of
how
intellectual
property
be
sell
.
we
try
to
retain
it
here
in
a
way
that
ensure
spin
-
out
company
can
be
create
but
it
do
not
always
happen
this
way
.
the
only
way
a
small
open
economy
dependent
on
foreign
direct
investment
can
ensure
that
investment
be
to
sell
technology
,
innovation
or
intellectual
property
because
it
realise
a
commercial
value
for
the
company
in
Ireland
and
retain
job
in
Ireland
.
I
hope
this
explain
it
.
regard
deputy
Lyons
's
point
,
have
a
presence
in
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
allow
one
a
overview
.
consider
the
teaching
of
mathematics
,
in
which
leave
certificate
pupil
who
be
well
capable
of
do
high
level
math
be
instead
choose
to
do
low
level
.
it
be
a
calculate
decision
on
point
and
the
allocation
of
time
and
resource
.
we
must
move
away
from
that
scenario
and
project
Maths
be
move
in
the
right
direction
.
the
government
be
seek
to
give
political
impetus
to
great
involvement
by
industry
stakeholder
in
shape
policy
so
that
people
might
be
encourage
towards
industry
and
provide
with
the
necessary
preparation
and
skill
.
this
will
take
time
and
I
would
like
this
committee
or
a
sub-
committee
thereof
to
have
a
central
role
in
that
regard
.
if
we
have
expert
within
,
we
should
find
they
a
role
to
try
to
work
out
the
nut
and
bolt
.
from
a
basic
pedagogical
point
of
view
,
the
idea
of
a
steady
pipeline
and
a
more
round
graduate
mean
more
apply
learning
and
problem
solving
as
oppose
to
by
rote
learning
.
the
latter
seem
to
have
evolve
to
such
a
point
that
young
people
who
be
go
into
university
or
institute
of
technology
still
structure
they
learning
in
this
way
.
the
apply
learning
skill
set
need
to
be
buttress
so
that
,
when
company
employ
graduate
,
this
will
be
one
way
to
ensure
apply
learning
have
be
well
build
in
psychologically
.
I
think
it
be
the

that
the

have
set
job
creation

as
one
of
its

to
the
heart
of
what

research
and

have
evolve
to
become
a
key
driver
of
business
success
.
I
would
like
to
outline
the
area
of
focus
within
my
brief
as
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
.
they
be
support
the
agenda
for
research
,
development
and
innovation
and
ensure
it
be
a
strong
driver
of
growth
;
prioritise
public
investment
in
research
,
development
and
innovation
so
we
obtain
the
great
possible
return
on
we
investment
in
term
of
job
,
new
intellectual
property
and
technology
;
win
more
FDI
investment
and
get
enhance
technology
and
idea
rapidly
from
research
to
company
that
will
commercialise
they
;
and
ensure
that
we
education
system
be
lining
up
the
skill
and
expertise
need
for
the
future
.
we
emerge
workforce
will
need
skill
in
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
math
and
this
skill
must
be
foster
from
the
early
day
of
school
life
.
I
strongly
welcome
the
fact
that
we
cost
base
be
improve
to
enhance
we
competitiveness
but
cost
reduction
be
only
part
of
the
answer
.
if
we
be
to
compete
and
be
successful
in
the
challenging
and
competitive
trade
environment
in
which
we
operate
,
Ireland
must
become
both
a
high
productivity
and
high
innovation
economy
.
we
must
have
top

and
emb
it
in

because
this
be
a
sure
-
fire
way
for

to
acquire
a
competitive

the

.

go
from

more
licensing
of

be
good
for
industry
and
academia
.
I
accept
the
peak
in
2008
have
reduce
but
it
have
go
up
on

since

.
SFI
capital

increase
from

in

the
change
that
will
take
place
in
the
county
enterprise
board
structure
will
bring
they
more
in
line
with
the
one
-
stop
shop
model
.
this
will
also
address
some
of
the
concern
regard
enterprise
support
at
local
level
.
we
all
agree
there
need
to
be
a
more
streamlined
approach
.
I
absolutely
agree
with
the
point
make
on
fragmentation
.
with
regard
to
job
creation
in
science
,
technology
and
innovation
I
would
argue
there
be
highly
evolve
interaction
between
academia
and
industry
.
the
number
of
collaboration
be
very
high
.
it
be
highly
evolve
in
the
sense
that
Enterprise
Ireland
be
very
close
to
the
ground
and
very
knowledgeable
on
what
company
's
need
be
with
regard
to
science
,
technology
and
innovation
because
they
interface
with
they
on
a
daily
basis
.
I
think
I
can
stand
over
this
because
I
have
responsibility
for
science
,
technology
and
innovation
.
extend
the
remit
of
SFI
to
allow
it
into
the
apply
space
would
leverage
more
in
term
of
economic
output
.
however
,
a
challenge
still
exist
.
we
could
do
more
work
with
the
technology
transfer
office
in
each
institution
to
try
to
leverage
more
.
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
will
create
thematic
approach
on
where
research
funding
will
go
,
so
EI
,
SFI
and
the
IDA
will
be
lock
into
a
space
with
the
government
to
allow
as
much
as
possible
to
be
extract
.
it
would
allow
the
potential
to
be
exploit
commercially
to
create
more
job
in
the
field
.
it
be
not
a
case
of
rest
on
we
laurel
.
Successive
government
have
realise
the
potential
of
science
,
technology
and
innovation
and
more
and
more
related
foreign
direct
investment
job
be
embed
in
Ireland
by
virtue
of
the
research
and
development
component
.
we
cannot
overlook
this
either
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
deputy
Tóibín
on
streamlining
.
he
ask
for
figure
on
the
budget
allocation
for
county
enterprise
board
,
ceb
.
exchequer
funding
for
the
CEB
network
at
the
beginning
of
2011
be
€
27.2
million
of
which
€
15
million
be
make
available
for
capital
expenditure
.
in
the
past
two
week
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Perry
,
announce
funding
of
€
3.1
million
for
the
ceb
for
further
job
creation
project
in
the
remain
month
of
2011
.
I
have
not
see
the
metric
on
how
this
have
be
spend
so
far
or
what
be
the
return
on
the
investment
in
term
of
job
creation
.
it
have
yet
to
be
assess
as
far
as
I
be
aware
.
one
must
be
careful
with
regard
to
high
potential
start
-
up
.
I
imagine
the
deputy
have
a
figure
in
mind
,
and
he
mention
100
in
Dublin
alone
.
if
one
seek
to
achieve
this
,
one
can
not
be
afraid
of
failure
.
by
this
I
mean
in
the
US
,
which
have
a
highly
-
evolve
venture
capital
structure
,
there
be
few
hang
-
up
about
failure
.
however
,
if
the
State
will
fund
a
exponentially
large
number
of
high
potential
start
-
up
use
taxpayer
's
money
then
the
State
cannot
be
afraid
of
this
company
fail
.
there
be
a
good
chance
a
certain
proportion
of
high
potential
start
-
up
will
fail
.
the
balance
we
have
strike
be
correct
.
I
will
hear
the
deputy
's
view
on
it
and
I
have
a
open
mind
.
if
we
try
to
hit
this
target
we
will
be
do
fairly
well
.
we
must
be
mindful
that
we
be
fund
company
in
the
sector
use
taxpayer
's
money
and
we
must
be
careful
about
how
we
expend
this
resource
.
there
must
be
check
and
balance
to
ensure
the
risk
be
mitigate
.
much
work
be
be
do
with
regard
to
InterTradeIreland
and
the
North
-
South
link
.
the
trading
and
investing
in
a
smart
economy
strategy
be
launch
in
September
and
it
use
all
of
we
diplomatic
resource
to
maximise
support
for
Irish
business
in
key
market
.
the
focus
be
on
promote
team
Ireland
.
the
deputy
be
aware
of
the
good
work
do
by
the
government
throughout
the
island
with
regard
to
InterTradeIreland
.
I
do
not
have
statistic
with
I
on
this
work
but
I
can
come
back
to
the
deputy
with
the
information
.
I
take
the
point
.
another
point
to
make
on
funding
in
the
science
,
technology
and
innovation
framework
be
that
there
be
much
collaboration
on
the
framework
7
funding
model
between
North
and
South
.
Enterprise
Ireland
's
innovation
voucher
also
work
on
a
North
-
South
basis
.
I
be
happy
to
speak
to
the
deputy
on
the
point
he
have
make
.
I
be
not
entirely
sure
I
accept
Enterprise
Ireland
be
demand
-
lead
.
perhaps
more
could
be
do
with
regard
to
sme
but
the
level
of
engagement
between
Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
multinational
sector
which
support
more
than
100000
job
be
a
highly
-
evolve
model
and
constantly
push
out
.
if
member
have
not
already
do
so
I
encourage
they
to
visit
any
of
the
Enterprise
Ireland
partially
-
fund
centre
throughout
the
State
which
be
involved
in
fronty
research
with
industry
.
they
be
support
by
the
State
agency
in
a
very
highly
-
evolve
model
.
it
put
we
in
the
top
20
in
some
of
the
metric
in
specific
area
of
research
.
the
point
can
be
flesh
out
when
Enterprise
Ireland
come
before
the
committee
.
my
experience
as
a
minister
of
state
with
regard
to
work
with
Enterprise
Ireland
on
science
,
technology
and
innovation
be
that
there
be
no
complacency
.
it
constantly
listen
to
industry
on
its
need
.
if
one
visit
institute
such
as
the
Tyndall
Institute
in
Cork
;
the
Centre
for
Research
on
Adaptive
Nanostructures
and
Nanodevices
,
CRANN
;
Athlone
Institute
of
Technology
;
or
Institute
of
Technology
,
Sligo
one
will
see
a
highly
-
evolve
model
of
engagement
on
the
need
of
industry
by
the
State
agency
.
we
should
not
underestimate
this
.
perhaps
a
opportunity
will
be
provide
to
flesh
it
out
in
great
detail
.
I
be
not
aware
of
international
comparator
in
this
area
.
the
measurement
be
the
number
of
job
support
and
the
top
ten
and
top
20
we
hit
in
specific
field
of
research
.
eight
of
the
top
ten
pharmaceutical
company
be
base
in
Ireland
.
I
do
not
have
a
answer
but
I
will
come
back
to
the
deputy
.
to
reply
to
deputy
Conaghan
's
question
,
the
city
of
science
programme
will
be
a
vital
showcase
for
Ireland
.
it
will
happen
in
July
2012
and
we
be
expect
between
5000
and
7000
delegate
.
the
government
will
provide
€
2.9
million
towards
the
cost
of
the
programme
which
will
cost
approximately
€
6
million
.
they
key
focus
will
be
on
showcase
Ireland
's
talent
in
this
field
to
boost
we
standing
internationally
.
the
multiplier
effect
of
up
to
7000
delegate
return
to
they
respective
country
will
be
great
.
we
key
goal
be
to
promote
the
country
in
this
global
setting
.
the
programme
will
have
the
knock
-
on
effect
of
promote
career
in
science
and
great
engagement
by
student
and
parent
because
of
the
publicity
that
will
be
generate
.
we
be
,
therefore
,
take
the
event
seriously
.
in
the
recent
past
people
have
make
a
joke
about
Ireland
try
to
restore
its
international
reputation
,
but
the
government
take
this
agenda
seriously
,
of
which
this
programme
be
part
.
if
we
take
the
opportunity
to
showcase
the
good
and
the
bright
,
we
will
get
a
return
on
we
investment
in
term
of
reputational
enhancement
.
that
be
one
part
of
the
process
.
with
regard
to
school
,
project
Maths
be
a
vital
component
at
second
level
.
the
ship
have
sail
and
the
programme
will
be
roll
out
in
every
school
.
we
believe
strongly
that
because
of
how
it
be
teach
,
it
will
have
a
positive
effect
downstream
on
examination
result
.
the
provision
of
bonus
point
next
year
should
result
in
a
mark
change
in
the
result
obtain
.
the
aim
be
to
ensure
student
think
more
laterally
about
the
everyday
use
of
math
.
we
want
to
deconstruct
a
language
where
parent
say
they
be
never
any
good
at
math
and
this
be
reinforce
in
they
child
.
if
we
can
do
this
,
there
will
be
a
positive
effect
downstream
,
but
we
have
to
be
mindful
of
the
need
to
ensure
that
while
education
be
a
priority
,
there
be
a
balance
between
this
and
the
graduate
we
produce
.
the
intention
should
not
only
be
to
churn
out
engineer
in
order
that
they
can
interface
with
company
but
also
to
get
student
to
think
laterally
in
solve
problem
,
which
be
the
key
component
.
within
the
innovation
and
math
space
we
have
young
social
innovator
.
I
attend
a
event
in
my
home
town
of
Mallow
which
be
attend
by
more
than
2000
parent
and
primary
schoolchild
who
interact
with
provider
in
the
science
and
math
space
.
a
great
deal
of
work
be
be
do
by
the
national
centre
of
excellence
in
the
University
of
Limerick
,
Calmast
and
the
Blackrock
Castle
Observatory
in
Cork
.
the
aim
of
this
initiative
be
to
make
STEM
subject
more
attractive
to
student
at
a
young
age
.
we
be
have
success
in
this
regard
,
but
the
challenge
will
be
to
roll
out
this
project
in
primary
school
.
the
fundamental
question
be
whether
it
be
possible
to
teach
entrepreneurship
.
be
it
something
that
be
innate
or
can
it
be
learn
?
that
be
a
matter
on
which
I
would
defer
to
Senator
Quinn
.
there
be
now
more
flexible
model
in
school
,
particularly
in
transition
year
.
the
YSI
model
be
very
good
and
we
have
see
a
major
proliferation
of
company
be
set
up
at
school
level
.
it
seem
to
be
more
embed
,
but
if
we
need
to
do
more
I
would
like
to
hear
the
Senator
's
view
on
that
.
where
do
we
go
and
be
we
on
the
right
track
?
I
believe
we
be
with
Project
Maths
.
we
need
to
do
more
in
the
junior
cycle
,
but
the
Department
be
do
considerable
work
in
that
and
the
primary
sector
be
the
key
.
we
will
have
continue
professional
development
of
teacher
,
especially
for
teacher
who
be
out
of
field
.
I
may
have
use
the
term
unqualified
teacher
before
-
I
openly
admit
that
be
the
wrong
choice
of
phrasing
.
we
need
to
look
at
out
-
of
-
field
teacher
who
be
teach
math
and
invest
money
-
which
will
happen
-
in
upskil
that
teacher
and
provide
CPD
.
it
all
depend
on
the
engagement
of
the
teacher
and
school
,
and
I
hope
they
will
engage
.
we
also
have
the
excellent
discover
science
and
engineering
programme
run
by
Forfás
,
which
do
much
outreach
with
individual
school
.
Peter
Brabazon
there
do
great
work
in
interact
with
school
.
I
have
only
just
begin
to
engage
with
the
issue
of
fear
of
failure
.
it
be
wear
like
a
badge
of
honour
by
American
engage
with
vc
.
it
be
almost
as
if
one
must
fail
in
order
to
ultimately
succeed
.
we
should
inculcate
that
culture
that
one
be
allow
to
fail
once
and
the
State
agency
will
support
such
a
person
who
want
to
come
back
into
the
system
again
.
the
Department
set
up
a
ICT
steering
group
in
2010
.
that
be
a
stakeholder
forum
to
address
the
issue
deputy
Lyons
and
Senator
Clune
raise
.
we
need
to
start
with
the
dotcom
bubble
that
burst
,
which
lead
to
a
decrease
in
the
point
requirement
for
science
and
ICT
-
related
course
.
as
demand
for
that
course
have
now
increase
,
some
of
that
demand
will
be
fulfil
,
albeit
within
the
next
three
to
four
year
.
the
question
be
what
we
should
do
in
the
intervene
period
to
fill
the
2500
vacancy
deputy
Lyons
mention
.
the
Department
will
shortly
roll
out
a
facility
to
facilitate
bridging
of
the
skill
gap
for
industry
.
that
will
facilitate
engineer
or
other
who
want
to
upskill
and
transfer
into
the
industry
.
this
issue
be
be
tackle
,
but
the
fundamental
issue
be
one
of
get
kid
to
engage
in
programming
language
.
they
know
how
to
play
game
and
be
early
adopter
of
technology
.
I
have
witness
this
with
child
as
young
as
two
year
of
age
.
how
do
we
get
they
into
a
space
in
which
they
begin
to
engage
in
create
game
and
the
knowledge
base
to
see
what
occur
behind
the
screen
?
this
be
where
we
want
to
go
.
work
be
be
do
in
this
regard
,
but
industry
,
include
internet
service
provider
,
have
a
great
role
to
play
.
a
further
engagement
with
the
Irish
Internet
Association
may
be
the
way
to
go
.
a
ICT
action
plan
be
in
place
.
its
purpose
be
to
engage
with
the
question
be
pose
by
deputy
Lyons
and
Senator
Clune
.
we
can
make
it
available
.
DSE
and
other
be
try
to
engage
kid
in
this
platform
,
but
the
work
be
disparate
.
we
have
hear
from
individual
work
with
vec
on
roll
out
specific
programme
in
,
for
example
,
east
County
Galway
,
where
someone
visit
school
to
teach
language
.
how
can
this
be
roll
out
across
the
State
,
give
the
fact
that
not
every
kid
will
be
able
to
engage
?
the
key
point
be
we
be
grapple
with
the
issue
.
one
must
strike
a
balance
between
the
core
educational
subject
and
other
subject
.
I
do
not
want
to
say
"
market
-
focus
"
,
but
if
we
want
to
create
the
good
graduate
in
the
world
,
that
be
the
space
we
must
enter
.
it
must
start
when
kid
be
young
.
the
action
plan
's
bridging
course
will
tackle
personnel
shortage
in
that
sector
in
the
short
term
.
I
have
just
be
inform
by
my
official
.
they
be
excellent
and
we
sometimes
underestimate
they
.
by
all
account
,
the
shortage
within
the
ICT
sector
be
a
global
phenomenon
.
we
be
conscious
of
this
fact
and
be
try
to
bridge
the
gap
.
we
need
to
maintain
the
engagement
with
technology
transfer
office
,
tto
.
the
structure
that
be
in
place
be
vital
.
they
current
round
of
funding
be
up
for
renewal
and
a
conversation
be
under
way
within
the
department
as
to
how
the
funding
process
will
evolve
.
I
have
meet
tto
from
individual
institution
and
one
cannot
but
be
impressed
by
they
work
.
we
need
to
discuss
with
they
the
question
of
extract
more
,
but
they
work
be
inherently
good
and
they
have
a
strong
link
with
industry
.
discussion
be
under
way
on
how
to
extract
further
ips
and
obtain
further
licensing
arrangement
,
whether
we
need
to
be
more
pragmatic
in
we
approach
and
whether
a
conversation
on
get
more
of
a
return
on
this
publicly
fund
research
be
necessary
.
the
tto
have
a
forward
-
look
viewpoint
and
I
will
meet
they
shortly
.
yes
.
one
must
be
conscious
of
the
need
for
tto
.
if
this
component
be
axe
,
there
will
be
a
major
gap
.
it
be
under
review
.
prearrange
-service
training
will
be
extend
.
there
will
be
a
two
-
year
high
diploma
and
a
B.
Ed
of
four
year
.
this
be
one
way
of
tackle
the
issue
.
I
have
a
good
meeting
with
the
Association
of
Secondary
teacher
Ireland
,
ASTI
,
last
week
.
there
seem
to
be
a
strong
willingness
to
engage
on
each
of
the
platform
in
question
.

this
be
encouraging

my
sense

that

want
to
upskill

.
deputy
McFadden
refer
to
incubator
unit
.
last
Friday
,
I
visit
Athlone
Institute
of
Technology
,
a
shine
light
regionally
in
how
this
unit
should
be
run
.
the
Midlands
Innovation
and
Research
Centre
,
MIRC
,
in
the
institute
be
do
fabulous
work
.
I
do
not
know
the
statistic
on
age
,
but
the
number
of
mature
student
in
high
level
institution
be
increase
year
on
year
.
this
be
one
way
of
tackle
the
skill
shortage
and
provide
opportunity
for
people
within
the
age
bracket
in
question
.
through
the

they

this
be
one
platform
.
the
labour

programme
deal
specifically
with
people
aged
over
50
year
.
JobBridge
provide
opportunity
for
people
to
obtain
skill
relevant
to
sector
other
than
that
in
which
they
work
heretofore
.
in
fairness
to
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
there
be
a
great
deal
be
do
to
ensure
we
get
people
within
that
age
bracket
back
into
the
workforce
.
deputy
McFadden
be
correct
that
there
be
people
with
huge
life
and
work
experience
who
do
not
necessarily
have
a
qualification
.
the
government
be
actively
try
to
bring
that
breadth
of
experience
back
into
structure
.
I
take
on
board
the
deputy

point
.

a

on

,
I
have
speak
at

on

on

about

often
,
what
they
need
be
mentoring
.
Enterprise
Ireland
operate
a
mentoring
programme
.
if
member
have
view
on
that
programme
-----
it
be
often
perceive
that
that
who
provide
mentoring
be
ex-consultant
or
ex-bank
manager
.
that
be
not
a
criticism
of
bank
manager
.
however
,
we
may
perhaps
need
a
wide
array
of
adviser
in
term
of
mentoring
.
I
be
happy
to
take
part
in
deep
engagement
with
the
committee
in
respect
of
issue
which
individual
member
believe
the
government
need
to
do
more
.
we
will
also
work
to
that
end

that
the

Justice
and
Equality
be
also
work
on

a
quick
turnaround
in
respect
of
visa
application
.
if
there
be
specific
example
,
I
would
like
to
hear
they
.
perhaps
we
should
take
a
close
look
at
that
issue
.
I
thank
deputy
Fleming
for
he
comment
and
question
.
I
agree
with
he
in
respect
of
the
priority
he
have
outline

I
hope
I
have
address
that
in
the
course
of
the
debate

I
welcome
the
visit
of
Mr.
Verhofstadt
.
his
engagement
with
the
people
of
Northern
Ireland
,
particularly
that
in
the
Border
region
,
and
he
comment
on
enable
Northern
Ireland
to
retain
access
to
the
single
market
and
custom
union
be
warmly
welcome
.
I
concur
with
my
fellow
speaker
who
have
say
that
by
any
objective
analysis
,
as
co-ordinator
Mr.
Verhofstadt
have
display
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
dynamic
at
play
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
he
be
right
when
he
say
that
responsibility
for
find
a
solution
to
the
Irish
Border
question
lie
with
the
UK
and
no
realistic
proposal
have
yet
emerge
from
that
quarter
.
my
first
question
be
very
simple
.
will
Mr.
Verhofstadt
and
he
colleague
,
Mr.
Brok
and
Mr.
Gualtieri
,
consider
include
within
the
wording
of
any
final
European
Parliament
resolution
a
clause
that
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
be
maintain
and
the
principle
of
parity
of
esteem
and
human
rights
protection
be
upheld
,
especially
give
that
56
%
of
the
population
in
Northern
Ireland
vote
to
remain
within
the
EU
?
if
no
such
protection
be
forthcoming
from
the
UK
,
will
the
European
Parliament
veto
any
outcome
that
do
not
satisfy
that
fundamental
rights
?
my
second
question
relate
to
a
very
good
article
by
Mr.
Verhofstadt
that
be
publish
in
the
Observer
on
9
July
last
,
in
which
he
write
very
rationally
about
the
UK
position
on
citizen
's
rights
.
he
refer
particularly
to
third
country
national
,
the
new
status
that
will
pertain
in
the
UK
,
the
need
for
separate
application
for
settle
status
and
the
five
-
year
residence
requirement
.
this
be
another
simple
question
.
how
seriously
be
the
European
Parliament
take
the
UK
's
negotiating
position
,
which
be
grossly
insulting
to
any
Irish
person
live
in
the
UK
who
have
settle
there
for
year
and
have
a
intergenerational
relationship
and
which
will
set
back
the
cause
of
Anglo
-
Irish
relation
by
year
?
I
would
like
to
know
Mr.
Verhofstadt
's
opinion
on
that
.
thank
you
very
much
,
a
Chathaoirligh
.
I
be
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
address
the
Seanad
today
at
the
beginning
of
what
may
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
year
in
world
development
.
this
year
,
2015
,
will
see
international
agreement
on
a
new
global
development
agenda
,
agreement
on
how
to
finance
this
agenda
,
and
a
legally
-
bind
agreement
on
climate
change
.
this
agreement
will
affect
all
of
we
,
but
they
will
particularly
affect
the
poor
and
most
vulnerable
.
the
year
2015
be
also
the
European
year
of
Development
,
dedicate
to
build
public
awareness
of
the
result
achieve
through
development
aid
and
a
great
understanding
of
global
justice
issue
.
will
I
proceed
?
however
,
before
we
look
forward
to
the
event
of
2015
,
I
would
like
to
take
a
look
back
at
some
of
the
key
achievement
and
process
of
Irish
Aid
in
the
past
year
.
last
year
,
the
government
allocate
almost
€600
million
to
official
Development
Assistance
.
this
represent
a
significant
investment
by
Ireland
in
build
a
fair
,
more
peaceful
and
more
sustainable
world
.
this
represent

world
.
as
a
small
island
nation
,
we
fate
be
inextricably
link
with
that
of
other
nation
and
people
.
we
give
aid
because
it
be
right
to
help
that
in
need
,
but
also
because
we
understand
that
it
be
in
we
interest
to
live
in
a
more
equal
and
prosperous
world
.
accord
to
a
recent
Europe
-
wide
survey
,
this
view
be
share
by
the
majority
of
Irish
people
,
of
whom
almost
nine
out
of
ten
believe
that
assist
develop
country
be
important
,
and
more
than
two
third
be
supportive
of
a
increase
in
the
aid
budget
.
the
past
year
have
be
mark
by
significant
policy
development
,
include
three
seminal
publication
-
the
Irish
Aid
Framework
for
Action
,
the
peer
review
of
we
aid
programme
by
the
OECD
development
assistance
committee
,
DAC
,
and
Ireland
's
foreign
policy
review
,
the
Global
Island
.
the
framework
for
action
,
which
be
launch
in
September
,
will
guide
policy
and
programming
decision
on
Ireland
's
aid
programme
between
now
and
2017
.
the
framework
outline
the
outcome
,
action
,
and
institutional
structure
necessary
to
achieve
the
goal
of
we
international
development
policy
,
one
World
,
one
Future
.
this
outcome
include
area
that
Ireland
have
work
on
for
decade
,
include
tackle
hunger
and
poverty
and
improve
access
to
basic
service
such
as
health
,
education
and
social
protection
.
it
also
include
relatively
new
area
of
work
in
we
aid
programme
,
such
as
address
climate
change
,
governance
and
human
rights
issue
and
integrate
trade
and
inclusive
economic
growth
.
Irish
Aid
's
internal
structure
have
be
reorganise
to
align
with
the
new
framework
,
with
new
policy
team
establish
on
inclusive
economic
growth
,
hunger
and
resilience
,
governance
and
accountability
and
essential
service
.
give
time
limitation
,
I
do
not
propose
to
go
into
detail
on
the
content
of
the
framework
,
but
I
encourage
all
Senator
to
read
the
document
,
which
be
available
on
the
Irish
Aid
website
,
because
it
be
easily
digestible
and
well
think
through
.
the
report
of
the
OECD
dac
peer
review
of
Ireland
's
aid
programme
be
publish
in
December
.
this
be
the
most
serious
,
wide
-
range
and
in
-
depth
review
of
each
country
's
aid
programme
do
by
peer
in
other
government
aid
programme
.
Ireland
's
review
be
carry
out
by
Austria
and
Portugal
,
with
Lithuania
as
a
observer
.
the
review
give
a
positive
assessment
of
Ireland
's
aid
programme
,
particularly
the
extent
to
which
it
be
target
at
the
poor
country
and
reach
that
who
be
most
vulnerable
.
it
commend
Ireland
on
ground
its
policy
in
the
need
and
priority
of
its
partner
country
and
have
a
clear
overall
vision
for
development
co-operation
.
the
review
note
that
Ireland
play
a
leadership
role
at
a
global
level
on
its
priority
issue
,
particularly
hunger
and
nutrition
.
it
also
praise
Ireland
for
respond
rapidly
and
effectively
to
natural
and
other
disaster
.
the
Ebola
crisis
in
west
Africa
be
a
case
in
point
.
the
peer
review
provide
valuable
recommendation
on
several
issue
,
include
improve
we
whole
-
of
-
government
approach
to
development
and
encourage
great
share
of
information
on
programme
and
project
,
both
externally
and
internally
.
work
be
under
way
to
address
most
of
this
recommendation
,
and
official
in
my
Department
will
address
the
area
highlight
over
the
come
year
.
the
third
key
policy
document
develop
in
2014
,
and
publish
only
a
few
week
ago
,
be
Ireland
's
foreign
policy
review
,
the
Global

.
this
consider
the
challenge
and
opportunity
for
Ireland
in
a
new
globalised
world
under
five
closely
link
theme
:
we
value
,
we
people
,
we
prosperity
,
we
place
in
Europe
,
and
we
influence
.
it
set
out
Ireland
's
support
for
a
fair
,
more
just
,
more
secure
and
more
sustainable
world
,
include
through
we
development
aid
programme
,
we
human

and
peacekeeping
policy
,
and
we
engagement
with
global
issue
such
as
climate
change
.
the
Global
Island
again
reaffirm
the
centrality
of
the
Irish
Aid
programme
to
we
foreign
policy
,
and
recognise
the
aid
programme
as
a
vital
tool
in
address
the
complex
factor
behind
poverty
,
hunger
and
inequality
.
we
will
continue
to
promote
development
as
a
key
part
of
we
value
and
we
foreign
policy
.
last
year
,
2014
,
be
also
a
year
which
present
massive
humanitarian
challenge
.
the
Ebola
crisis
and
a
unprecedented
refugee
crisis
arise
from
conflict
and
natural
disaster
cause
untold
suffering
and
put
a
heavy
strain
on
international
humanitarian
architecture
.
Ireland
play
a
strong
role
in
the
international
response
to
the
Ebola
crisis
through
we
embassy
in
Sierra
Leone
and
we
support
to
partner
base
in
affect
country
.
almost
9000
people
have
die
from
infection
with
the
Ebola
virus
and
more
than
22000
people
be
report
to
have
be
infect
.
Ireland
provide
funding
of
almost
€
18
million
in
2014
directly
and
to
organisation
work
on
the
Ebola
response
in
Sierra
Leone
and
Liberia
,
which
be
both
partner
country
for
Ireland
.
the
funding
support
Ebola
treatment
facility
,
community
awareness
raising
,
contact
tracing
and
child
nutrition
programme
.
Ireland
also
dispatch
42
tonne
of
essential
household
item
as
part
of
we
rapid
response
initiative
,
to
be
distribute
to
affect
community
.
this
include
blanket
,
tent
,
mosquito
net
,
soap
and
water
tank
.
I
travel
to
Sierra
Leone
in
October
last
year
and
witness
the
difference
be
make
by
the
work
of
we
embassy
staff
and
Irish
Aid
's
support
to
we
partner
organisation
on
the
ground
.
I
meet
Irish
aid
worker
in
organisation
such
as
Goal
and
concern
,
as
well
as
the
Sierra
Leone
Government
and
UN
partner
.
while
the
challenge
be
overwhelming
,
I
be
hugely
impressed
with
the
dedication
of
that
work
to
alleviate
the
crisis
,
and
with
the
effectiveness
of
we
response
.
I
pay
particular
tribute
to
we
key
personnel
on
the
ground
,
include
we
ambassador
,
Ms
Sinead
Walsh
,
and
she
team
,
and
acknowledge
the
influential
role
she
have
have
in
ensure
a
adequate
and
proactive
international
response
to
the
crisis
.
there
appear
to
have
be
a
welcome
slowdown
in
infection
rate
in
recent
week
,
though
there
be
fluctuation
from
country
to
country
.
it
be
critical
,
however
,
that
we
be
not
complacent
as
a
international
community
.
Ireland
will
continue
to
support
the
response
to
the
Ebola
crisis
and
its
secondary
impact
on
community
in
2015
.
the
ongoing
conflict
in
Syria
and
the
region
have
create
a
deeply
troubling
humanitarian
crisis
.
more
than
200000
people
have
die
,
with
12.2
million
people
in
need
of
immediate
life
-
save
support
within
Syria
.
due
to
the
violence
and
the
lack
of
access
to
aid
,
3.8
million
people
have
leave
Syria
for
neighbour
country
.
many
of
that
in
need
of
humanitarian
assistance
be
beyond
reach
,
with
both
the
Syrian
government
and
rebel
faction
use
siege
tactic
and
heavy
weaponry
in
populate
area
.
the
target
of
humanitarian
worker
by
Islamic
State
also
prevent
million
from
receive
the
help
they
desperately
need
.
the
UN
have
respond
by
deliver
cross
-
border
aid
,
even
where
the
Assad
regime
have
withheld
permission
.
since
2011
,
Ireland
have
provide
nearly
€
29
million
in
humanitarian
support
,
deliver
through
UN
partner
,
the
Red
Cross
and
Irish
ngo
.
Ireland
's
support
have
be
focus
on
support
people
displace
within
Syria
and
that
across
the
wide
region
.
in
December
2014
,
the
UN
release
its
2015
Syria
crisis
appeal
plan
,
request
more
than
$
8.4
billion
to
meet
the
need
of
18
million
people
in
Syria
and
across
the
region
.
we
be
consider
how
Ireland
can
well
respond
to
the
need
for
additional
assistance
in
2015
.
Ireland
be
also
continue
to
respond
to
acute
cris
in
South
Sudan
,
the
Central
African
Republic
and
Iraq
,
which
have
witness
displacement
of
huge
number
of
people
due
to
ongoing
violence
.
most
recently
,
we
have
mobilise
emergency
supplies
to
respond
to
the
devastating
flood
in
Malawi
,
as
part
of
we
rapid
response
initiative
and
in
co-ordination
with
we
embassy
in
Lilongwe
.
if
the
past
year
be
fill
with
important
milestone
for
Irish
aid
policy
and
programming
,
2015
promise
to
see
key
milestone
in
the
global
development
agenda
.
with
agreement
expect
on
a
set
of
sustainable
development
goal
and
a
intergovernmental
climate
change
deal
,
this
year
have
be
compare
to
1945
in
term
of
its
importance
to
world
development
.
the
sustainable
development
goal
will
be
a
set
of
universally
applicable
goal
and
target
negotiate
and
agree
by
the
world
's
193
country
.
they
be
aim
at
eradicate
poverty
,
address
environmental
degradation
and
climate
change
as
well
as
build
a
more
peaceful
,
fair
and
sustainable
world
.
the
goal
will
cover
such
diverse
area
as
agriculture
,
education
,
gender
equality
,
health
,
justice
,
employment
and
environmental
degradation
.
this
have
never
be
attempt
before
and
will
be
a
huge
achievement
for
humanity
if
successful
.
this
year
,
2015
,
will
also
see
agreement
on
how
to
finance
this
goal
at
the
financing
for
development
conference
in
Ethiopia
in
July
.
Ireland
be
privileged
to
be
at
the
heart
of
the
sustainable
development
goal
process
follow
we
appointment
as
co-facilitator
with
Kenya
of
the
inter
-
governmental
negotiation
to
agree
the
goal
.
we
appointment
be
testament
to
the
reputation
of
Ireland
's
aid
programme
,
Irish
Aid
,
we
proud
record
of
promote
human
rights
and
we
participation
in
peacekeeping
right
across
the
globe
.
this
final
phase
of
negotiation
officially
begin
on
19
January
and
will
culminate
in
a
summit
of
world
leader
in
September
2015
.
agreement
on
a
legally
bind
climate
change
treaty
will
be
another
critical
achievement
.
climate
change
have
already
negatively
affect
the
life
of
million
of
people
in
the
world
,
from
small
farmer
in
Africa
to
that
in
the
small
island
state
of
the
Pacific
.
if
we
fail
to
act
quickly
and
radically
,
we
be
on
course
to
make
we
own
planet
uninhabitable
for
vast
number
of
people
.
that
may
sound
verbose
but
that
be
the
scenario
we
be
face
.
indeed
,
recent
weather
pattern
be
testament
to
that
fact
.
I
be
proud
that
Ireland
be
play
such
a
key
role
in
establish
this
new
global
agenda
and
I
look
forward
to
ensure
that
we
contribute
to
a
new
era
of
global
development
where
poverty
and
hunger
be
consign
to
history
.
I
thank
the
acting
chairman
and
member
for
the
opportunity
to
address
the
Seanad
this
afternoon
.
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
outline
the
work
we
have
do
in
the
past
year
and
to
highlight
some
of
the
important
upcoming
issue
for
this
year
.
I
look
forward
to
we
discussion
and
any
feedback
or
question
Senator
may
have
.
there
be
eight
country
in
Africa
and
Vietnam
.
just
for
the
record
,
it
be
important
that
I
correct
that
assertion
utterly
.
I
be
happy
to
address
it
in
my
reply
and
I
be
aware
that
the
Senator
only
have
five
minute
,
but
we
do
not
tie
we
aid
.
we
have
a
Africa
strategy
as
well
as
the
Africa
Ireland
economic
Forum
.
I
would
be
happy
to
address
the
Senator
's
point
but
,
for
the
record
,
we
do
not
use
we
Irish
Aid
budget
for
trade
promotion
.
I
thank
all
of
the
Senator
for
they
contribution
.
I
will
start
with
oda
and
percentage
target
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
target
be
set
in
1973
.
since
then
,
there
have
not
be
a
government
that
have
reach
they
.
the
high
point
be
reach
in
2008
when
we
hit
approximately
0.59
%
,
or
a
monetary
figure
of
€
920.6
million
.
I
regard
this
as
a
apolitical
space
because
,
throughout
successive
government
,
every
political
party
and
Independent
in
the
House
have
acknowledge
the
need
to
ensure
that
,
in
the
first
instance
,
we
recognise
how
official
development
assistance
play
a
key
role
in
we
foreign
policy
and
impact
on
the
poor
country
.
while
there
have
be
a
30
%
decrease
in
ODA
since
2008
across
a
number
of
political
mandate
,
there
be
a
recognition
that
,
in
the
past
two
year
,
we
have
try
to
stabilise
it
.
we
do
stabilise
it
last
year
,
and
increase
it
.
while
a
point
be
raise
about
a
decrease
in
some
of
the
bilateral
funding
and
a
increase
in
multilateral
funding
,
the
fact
remain
that
,
through
we
multilateral
arrangement
and
relationship
with
the
World
food
Programme
or
the
UN
agency
,
it
still
continue
to
create
the
necessary
impact
.
the
tyre
be
kick
on
this
policy
by
virtue
of
the
dac
or
the
OECD
report
which
give
we
a
clean
bill
of
health
.
there
be
one
further
point
on
the
ODA
as
a
percentage
of
GNP
figure
.
Ireland
be
rank
ninth
of
OECD
country
and
seventh
of
EU
country
.
the
country
ahead
of
we
in
the
OECD
list
of
country
include
Norway
.
its
figure
be
1.07
.
Norway
,
Sweden
,
Luxembourg
,
Denmark
and
the
UK
be
ahead
of
we
in
the
sense
that
they
have
reach
or
surpass
the
target
.
however
,
we
be
ninth
in
the
ranking
.
the
Netherlands
,
Finland
and
Switzerland
be
ahead
of
we
but
have
not
have
reach
the
target
and
they
be
comparatively
rich
country
.
we
be
,
therefore
,
by
any
objective
standard
,
do
quite
well
in
term
of
seek
to
reach
the
target
.
however
,
we
have
not
take
we
eye
off
the
ball
.
it
have
to
be
remember
that
the
target
be
set
and
successive
minister
,
across
the
political
spectrum
,
have
reinforce
the
commitment
to
it
.
it
be
in
the
programme
for
government
,
but
what
we
have
seek
to
do
in
the
programme
for
government
be
increase
we
level
of
assistance
in
monetary
term
.
however
,
we
be
not
go
to
hit
the
0.7
%
target
.
this
be
clear
.
furthermore
,
the
next
government
,
whatever
its
make
-
up
in
term
of
party
politics
,
will
also
not
hit
the
0.7
%
target
.
however
,
we
must
continue
to
try
to
stabilise
the
monetary
element
of
it
and
increase
it
if
we
can
.
it
would
be
necessary
to
pay
out
more
than
€
1
billion
in
the
current
year
if
we
be
to
hit
the
0.7
%
target
.
this
be
not
attainable
give
other
demand
on
education
and
health
service
and
so
on
.
on
compliance
and
governance
issue
in
respect
of
how
we
dispense
the
funding
,
the
Ugandan
experience
be
mention
.
we
meet
the
select
Committee
on
foreign
affair
and
Trade
last
week
as
part
of
the
estimate
process
.
I
have
outline
previously
at
that
committee
that
we
be
very
satisfied
that
all
of
the
check
and
balance
be
in
place
on
how
we
funding
be
disperse
.
although
we
have
a
bilateral
relationship
with
Uganda
,
there
have
be
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
funding
we
have
give
to
it
.
we
be
currently
review
the
programme
.
since
that
event
take
place
,
we
have
recover
the
money
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer
and
very
clear
check
and
balance
have
be
put
in
place
.
we
do
not
tie
we
aid
,
as
other
country
do
,
to
the
purchase
of
Irish
goods
and
service
.
we
deliberately
do
not
do
this
.
when
disburse
aid
through
,
for
instance
,
we
ngo
,
Irish
Aid
or
the
UN
for
stock
,
we
do
not
stipulate
that
particular
Irish
stock
must
be
buy
.
we
require
transparency
and
a
chain
of
event
to
ensure
we
know
where
the
money
be
go
.
we
be
satisfied
with
this
approach
.
if
we
start
tie
aid
to
particular
action
,
we
be
leave
ourselves
open
to
become
a
hostage
to
fortune
.
the
reason
it
have
work
so
well
for
we
historically
,
since
Garrett
FitzGerald
first
instigate
a
Irish
aid
programme
,
be
because
we
have
have
a
honesty
in
we
approach
to
people
.
we
have
never
come
with
a
agenda
.
at
the
same
time
,
this
do
not
mean
that
we
cannot
look
at
Africa
as
a
continent
with
1.1
billion
people
with
which
we
can
trade
.
we
trade
with
country
such
as
Japan
,
where
we
have
a
ambassador
and
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
representative
.
we
have
bilateral
relationship
with
eight
partner
country
in
Africa
.
if
we
take
one
of
the
eight
partner
country
,
for
instance
,
Sierra
Leone
,
Kenya
or
Nigeria
,
there
be
no
reason
we
cannot
,
through
ambassadorial
or
bilateral
relationship
,
seek
to
trade
with
this
country
as
well
.
we
have
a
Africa
strategy
.
every
year
we
have
a
Ireland
-
Africa
economic
forum
.
I
will
dig
out
the
statistic
which
I
write
down
early
.
we
have
increase
trade
.
in
2010
,
we
trade
on
a
Ireland
-
Africa
basis
be
approximately
€
1.7
billion
.
in
2013
,
it
go
up
to
€
2.3
billion
.
I
may
be
pluck
this
figure
from
the
air
,
but
by
2020
there
be
the
potential
for
€
20
billion
in
trade
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
.
it
be
€
24
billion
.
we
be
absolutely
right
to
examine
and
set
this
as
a
target
.
there
be
not
a
senator
in
this
House
who
have
not
have
some
experience
of
a
humanitarian
visit
to
various
country
.
when
at
this
refugee
camp
or
when
visit
particular
area
where
Irish
Aid
be
involved
,
one
might
see
a
mother
who
may
have
travel
200
mile
with
she
child
from
south
Sudan
to
Gambella
.
look
at
the
child
,
one
cannot
but
wonder
how
we
can
help
to
educate
this
child
in
order
that
they
can
become
entrepreneur
and
have
access
to
health
and
educational
service
similar
to
ours
.
how
can
they
become
entrepreneur
?
one
way
of
look
at
this
be
to
share
what
we
do
well
,
through
we
innovation
system
,
with
that
grow
number
of
people
.
the
figure
be
more
than
1.1
billion
.
there
have
be
a
increase
of
2
million
year
on
year
in
the
number
of
people
live
in
Ethiopia
.
it
be
about
trading
service
as
well
as
assist
in
capacity
building
.
the
two
be
not
mutually
exclusive
.
Senator
Higgins
mention
the
Alan
Kerins
project
.
Irish
people
be
deliver
excellent
people
on
the
ground
through
the
Alan
Kerins
project
and
through
GOAL
,
Gorta
,
self
help
Africa
and
concern
.
we
will
continue
to
be
commit
to
the
development
agenda
and
the
humanitarian
agenda
.
however
,
we
must
also
focus
on
how
we
can
trade
more
efficiently
,
that
be
,
through
mutually
beneficial
trade
in
a
non-tied
way
in
order
that
we
can
trade
with
what
be
a
sleeping
giant
of
a
continent
.
we
be
lucky
that
we
do
not
look
at
it
from
a
homogenous
point
of
view
.
we
do
not
say
that
Africa
be
one
continent
with
one
people
.
we
recognise
the
fact
that
Sierra
Leone
be
different
from
South
Africa
which
be
different
from
Nigeria
.
we
be
lucky
that
we
have
relationship
with
all
three
of
this
country
and
we
must
continue
to
look
for
trading
opportunity
with
they
.
I
take
the
point
Senator
Burke
make
on
humanitarian
cris
.
to
be
fair
to
we
,
if
one
take
the
humanitarian
crisis
in
Syria
-
I
have
outline
some
of
the
figure
-
or
the
Ebola
crisis
in
west
Africa
as
example
,
we
have
be
able
,
in
a
very
reflexive
way
,
to
pivot
towards
this
cris
when
they
occur
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
have
people
on
the
ground
.
if
one
take
Gaza
,
for
instance
,
which
be
mention
,
it
be
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
have
a
relationship
through
we
office
in
Ramallah
that
we
have
be
able
to
fund
the
humanitarian
cris
there
.
on
Syria
,
much
of
the
funding
be
divest
through
multilateral
organisation
because
we
do
not
have
a
bilateral
relationship
with
it
.
a
flexibility
have
be
build
into
the
Irish
system
by
successive
government
to
ensure
Irish
Aid
be
adequately
fund
in
order
that
it
can
pivot
its
funding
opportunity
as
the
cris
arise
.
the
issue
of
human
rights
be
raise
and
I
appreciate
the
point
be
make
in
respect
of
Nigeria
,
for
instance
.
we
have
a
bilateral
relationship
with
Nigeria
.
it
would
be
easy
for
we
to
say
we
should
not
fund
particular
country
because
of
a
human
rights
or
governance
record
,
or
a
lack
thereof
.
we
view
have
always
be
that
if
we
have
a
bilateral
relationship
we
ensure
the
funding
get
to
that
people
who
be
most
in
need
.
the
people
who
be
most
in
need
be
sometimes
not
well
serve
by
they
own
government
,
but
at
the
same
time
they
depend
on
we
.
the
governance
we
have
,
the
honesty
we
bring
as
a
country
to
we
relationship
with
various
country
and
we
lack
of
a
colonial
history
or
baggage
,
by
which
I
mean
we
have
not
go
out
to
colonise
,
allow
we
to
influence
human
rights
in
a
very
subtle
and
discreet
way
,
which
we
do
over
time
.
Ethiopia
be
one
of
we
long
-
stand
key
partner
country
,
and
Addis
Ababa
be
the
diplomatic
capital
of
Africa
.
a
recent
visit
by
President
Michael
D.
Higgins
,
who
address
the
African
Union
,
serve
as
a
opportunity
to
impart
message
to
the
African
Union
that
for
the
relationship
to
be
equal
they
must
be
such
that
human
rights
become
a
key
function
or
pillar
in
any
African
nation
's
governance
.
we
do
not
do
it
with
a
sledgehammer
but
through
subtle
diplomacy
,
and
this
have
allow
we
to
make
progress
over
time
.
the
issue
of
climate
change
have
be
raise
as
have
the
sustainable
development
goal
.
recently
I
visit
Africa
.
if
one
look
at
the
work
Irish
Aid
be
do
there
,
through
key
partner
on
the
ground
and
specifically
at
the
work
be
do
to
assist
farmer
in
Tigre
,
which
be
the
scene
of
the
famous
famine
of
the
early
to
mid-1980
,
one
can
see
how
agricultural
system
have
come
on
greatly
.
one
of
the
programme
in
the
area
be
on
potato
generation
.
this
could
all
be
compromise
by
climate
change
if
there
be
a
2
°c
rise
in
temperature
globally
.
we
take
very
seriously
we
role
in
negotiate
the
sustainable
development
goal
in
co-facilitation
with
Kenya
.
the
reason
we
do
so
be
because
we
be
mindful
of
the
relationship
we
have
in
the
country
which
be
most
affect
by
climate
change
.
we
know
we
people
who
work
with
people
there
,
which
bring
a
honesty
,
openness
and
transparency
to
how
we
will
approach
the
negotiation
.
we
be
not
weigh
down
with
the
baggage
of
have
be
a
coloniser
.
we
know
exactly
what
it
be
like
in
the
first
instance
and
we
be
able
to
speak
for
that
country
which
will
need
Ireland
to
be
at
they
back
and
be
a
honest
broker
in
this
association
throughout
2015
.
rather
than
specifically
address
every
member
I
have
address
general
point
.
I
hope
I
have
adequately
address
the
point
on
the
percentage
of
GNP
target
and
the
issue
of
compliance
and
transparency
with
regard
to
Uganda
and
tie
aid
.
I
ask
Senator
O'Reilly
to
forgive
I
for
interrupt
she
speech
.
I
be
conscious
that
Senator
must
leave
to
attend
other
meeting
,
and
I
want
to
ensure
I
be
able
to
clarify
the
point
in
case
she
need
to
leave
,
but
she
be
still
here
.
I
hope
I
have
generally
speak
to
the
issue
of
climate
change
and
the
sustainable
development
goal
.
it
be
not
for
I
to
speak
specifically
to
the
point
on
population
control
in
specific
country
.
we
be
very
strong
on
gender
equality
and
extremely
strong
on
the
issue
of
maternal
health
and
nutrition
as
it
be
one
of
we
priority
.
one
can
see
this
in
action
in
country
such
as
Sierra
Leone
and
Ethiopia
in
particular
.
we
be
also
extremely
strong
on
issue
such
as
fistula
which
,
I
be
shocked
to
stay
,
still
exist
.
Ethiopia
have
set
target
for
itself
.
the
idea
that
in
instance
a
pregnant
woman
cannot
get
to
a
centre
in
enough
time
to
be
able
to
give
birth
in
a
safe
environment
be
,
to
my
mind
,
shocking
.
we
be
work
very
hard
with
we
partner
to
try
to
tackle
this
issue
.
with
regard
to
Syria
specifically
,
we
have
allocate
€
29
million
since
2011
to
the
crisis
there
.
in
geopolitical
term
it
be
a
major
challenge
.
we
all
acknowledge
this
and
it
be
self
-
evident
.
through
we
investment
we
have
ensure
we
be
work
with
the
Irish
ngo
on
the
ground
,
the
Red
Cross
in
particular
,
and
the
Unite
Nation
through
multilateral
arrangement
.
we
be
now
see
a
situation
arise
in
Lebanon
where
certain
tension
be
begin
to
emerge
between
Lebanese
people
and
the
Syrian
refugee
there
.
we
be
monitor
it
and
I
know
for
a
fact
we
will
retain
a
focus
on
Syria
.
we
continue
to
monitor
it
proactively
.

however
,
marketing

be

there
be
no
mention
at
all
of
marketing
in

.
also
,
in
section

(

,
a
inference
can
be
make
that
IFI
could
focus
on
protection
and
conservation
of
wildlife
with
the
National
Parks
and
Wildlife
Service
.
Fish
be
a
natural
resource
and
can
bring
income
into
the
State
and
it
be
important
to
recognise
that
.
I
move
amendment
no.

it

there
could
be
a

void

that
be
the
basis

in

of
the
Minister

State
's
response
,
I
will
be
happy
to
examine
this
again
on
report
stage
.
I
will
withdraw
my
amendment
.
it
be
a
question
of
recognise
the
role
of
the
various
stakeholder
in
the
region
and
find
some
formula
for
they
to
have
a
voice
.
this
be
the
primary
aim
of
the
amendment

in
support
of
the
amendment
,
I
take
the
view
that
if
what
we
be
talk
about
here
be
a
natural
resource
,
then
we
need
to
hold
the
research
up
to
public
scrutiny
.
if
that
mean
it
be
contested
,
so
be
it
.
that
be
the
nature
of
research
,
whether
social
or
scientific
.
research
should
be
contestable
and
hold
up
to
public
scrutiny
.
I
support
the
amendment
on
that
basis
.
the
provision
state
the
minister
may
"
specify
by
order

means
"
.
that
wording
be
too
vague
.
it
would
be
helpful
if
there
be
a
more
qualitative
interpretation
of
what
it
mean
on

stage
.
I
move
amendment
no.

appear
to
be
to
allow

of

who
receive
a
award
from
the
redress
board
benefit
from
the
fund
in
so
far
as
it
relate
to

I
should
point
out
that
the
receipt
of
a
grant
or
assistance
for
educational
service
from
the
education
finance
board
be
not
link
to
the
receipt

from

board
.
any
former

he
or
she
relative
,
include
child
and
grandchild
,
could
benefit
.
widen
eligibility
to
include
child
and
grandchild
would
result
in
a
broadening
of
the
scope
of
the
fund
beyond
that
which
be
intend
.
while
amendment
Nosemcue
15
and
16
,
which
we
will
address
late
,
also
deal
with
the
issue
,
I
wish
to
say
at
this
point
that
it
remain
the
government
's
position
that
eligibility
for
the
new
fund
should
be
confine
to
former
resident
.
the
education
finance
board
do
excellent
work
in
term
of

the
money
that
come
from
the

congregation

the
2002
indemnity
agreement
.
former
resident
and
they
relative
benefit
from
this
support
.
it
be
always
clear
that
particular
fund
would
run
out
and
we
be
now
almost
at
that
point
.
I
appreciate
the
sentiment
express
by
the
deputy
regard
the
range
of
eligibility
issue
but
I
urge
they
to
see
the
sense
of
the
government
's
position
or
the
manner
in
which
we
be
try
to
operate
on
this
matter
.
on
individual
issue
that
be
raise
by
Deputy
Ryan
and
Ó
Ríordáin
,
the

board
run
a
comprehensive
advertising
campaign
.
it
cost
approximately
€
900000

involve

it
also

the
board
place

which
add

to
the

of
the

and
in

since
its
establishment
,
the
board
have
place
a
total
of
1492
advertisement
.
in
speak
of
the
grouping
of
amendment
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
address
the
specific
point
make
.
on
second
stage
,
he
state
:
[
N
]
to
to
have
a
open
-
end
,
long
,
tortuous
,
bureaucratic
quango
come
into
existence
,
we
have
decide
pragmatically
,
in
the
full
knowledge
of
the
decision
we
be
make
,
that
we
would
use
the
database
of
the
15000
people
who
have
already
be
give
award
.
that
be
the
database
that
be
already
there
-
we
know
what
it
be
.
to
start
again
,
give
they
age
and
give
the
period
when
the
abuse
take
place
,
would
have
take
a
enormous
amount
of
time
in
term
of
process
and
verify
that
information
.
the
minister
have
be
clear
on
this
.
we
must
go
back
to
the
fact
that
if
it
be
open
up
again
,
it
be
not
possible
to
quantify
the
number
of
person
who
would
come
forward
again
.
there
be
no
definitive
number
in
that
sense
.
in
term
of
expectation
,
if
the
eligibility
criterion
be
open
up
,
one
could
take
as
a
fair
barometer
the
940
application
which
be
not
deem
eligible
under
the
redress
board
application
.
the
good
approach
be
that
outline
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
on
second
Stage
,
which
be
to
proceed
on
the
basis
propose
in
the
Bill
.
the
question
of
review
eligibility
can
be
consider
after
the
fund
be
establish
in
the
event
of
there
not
be
a
significant
expenditure
of
the
fund
.
there
be
some
scope
.
I
must
,
therefore
,
oppose
the
amendment
.
I
will
respond
to
deputy
Ryan
's
point
first
.
when
I
mention
advertising
and
so
forth
,
I
do
so
to
show
that
the
State
seek
in
good
faith
to
reach
out
and
advertise
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
,
which
he
also
make
in
good
faith
.
a
amendment
require
a
review
within
a
certain
timeframe
could
be
consider
on
report
stage
,
but
only
follow
the
fund
's
establishment
.
at
that
time
,
the
committee
could
deliberate
with
the
minister
on
how
to
proceed
.
some
consideration
should
be
give
to
a
amendment
along
the
line
propose
.
I
will
reflect
this
point
of
view
to
the
minister
.
member
should
examine
the
amendment
's
wording
.
deputy
Crowe
's
state
"
eligible
to
apply
"
and
deputy
Smith
's
state
"
eligible
to
receive
"
,
but
eligibility
need
to
be
establish
.
if
person
do
not
come
forward
during
the
first
process
,
one
would
need
to
set
up
a
bureaucratic
mechanism
to
establish
eligibility
.
we
be
not
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
in
the
minister
's
opinion
,
a
estimate
of
15000
people
be
the
fair
way
to
deal
with
the
matter
.
he
have
be
clear
in
this
regard
.
we
do
not
know
what
the
number
be
,
as
they
range
from
a
few
people
to
a
couple
of
hundred
to
a
significant
cohort
,
depend
on
whom
one
ask
.
there
come
a
point
when
a
line
must
be
draw
.
I
do
not
want
to
use
emotive
language
and
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
sensitivity
involve
,
but
the
minister
state
he
intention
on
second
stage
clearly
.
we
will
oppose
the
amendment
.
with
all
due
respect
,
I
wish
to
establish
a
barometer
in
term
of
how
we
proceed
.
I
will
not
be
patronise
and
I
want
to
deal
with
the
deputy
respectfully
,
but
we
have
a
understanding
of
the
issue
at
hand
and
we
want
to
address
they
with
a
degree
of
sensitivity
and
respect
.
I
may
have
use
the
word
"
bureaucracy
"
but
I
be
not
sure
I
use
the
word
"
massive
bureaucracy
"
.
if
I
do
,
it
be
not
to
imply
that
a
whole
machine
would
have
to
be
create
around
this
.
the
central
point
be
that
the
fund
be
€
110
million
in
respect
of
which
15000
have
already
make
a
application
.
some
940
people
be
deem
ineligible
under
the
redress
process
because
they
be
not
resident
of
the
schedule
institution
.
on
the
legal
advice
issue
,
legal
advice
be
take
up
by
97
%
of
that
who
apply
under
the
original
scheme
.
that
advice
be
independent
legal
advice
which
the
people
seek
.
I
be
not
suggest
that
that
people
do
not
have
a
entitlement
to
that
legal
advice
,
I
be
merely
stress
it
be
independent
legal
advice
seek
by
they
.
person
have
a
degree
of
autonomy
and
discretion
in
term
of
whom
they
choose
as
they
legal
adviser
.
it
be
important
that
be
inherent
in
the
original
scheme
.
on
eligibility
to
apply
,
the
bureaucratic
aspect
arise
from
the
fact
that
we
would
again
now
have
to
establish
where
the
injury
take
place
,
which
re-open
the
whole
process
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
have
make
clear
he
position
in
regard
to
the
propose
amendment
.
clearly
a
annual
reporting
and
review
mechanism
could
be
establish
once
the
fund
be
establish
.
it
be
reasonable
to
ask
for
the
committee
to
have
due
regard
to
the
working
of
the
fund
or
review
the
process
.
we
should
all
adopt
a
open
mind
on
how
it
be
structure
.
when
the
minister
address
report
and
final
stage
there
should
be
some
response
to
the
suggestion
make
on
the
fund
,
its
use
,
and
where
spare
,
if
any
,
resource
be
deploy
.
at
this
stage
of
the
process
,
and
not
to
be
too
specific
,
I
acknowledge
that
the
issue
be
raise
,
that
the
minister
will
attend
for
the
next
stage
and
that
member
have
ask
that
he
have
regard
to
the
concern
that
they
raise
.
yes
,
there
be
potential
for
a
oversight
role
.
I
feel
strongly
that
I
should
not
make
a
definitive
statement
on
it
at
this
stage
.
the
minister
will
have
regard
to
the
process
and
,
effectively
,
with
due
deference
to
he
role
as
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
who
sit
at
cabinet
,
then
we
should
give
consideration
to
the
role
,
and
there
should
be
a
response
to
the
suggestion
.
the
fund
's
modus
operandi
should
be
determine
by
the
minister
.
there
will
be
a
annual
report
that
should
give
rise
to
a
process
in
term
of
how
it
be
parse
,
examine
or
interpret
.
counselling
service
be
specifically
provide
for
in
section
8
of
the
Bill
as
a
class
of
approve
service
.
I
be
uncertain
as
to
the
intent
behind
some
of
the
propose
amendment
.
while
I
appreciate
the
concern
that
a
former
resident
's
exist
counsellor
be
retain
once
the
fund
be
establish
,
I
do
not
see
how
that
position
would
be
threaten
simply
because
the
fund
be
establish
.
person
can
continue
to
attend
they
exist
counsellor
,
which
may
be
fund
under
the
National
Counselling
Service
,
without
recourse
to
the
fund
.
if
individual
be
privately
attend
counsellor
and
wish
to
apply
to
the
fund
to
have
this
service
fund
,
the
person
could
advise
the
fund
of
this
preference
in
they
application
.
once
the
counsellor
meet
the
criterion
for
service
provider
specify
by
the
fund
,
it
be
difficult
to
envisage
why
the
fund
would
not
agree
to
such
a
arrangement
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
issue
such
as
this
be
a
concern
to
individual
former
resident
,
but
they
be
matter
of
detail
that
should
be
leave
to
the
fund
,
which
be
require
to
act
in
the
interest
of
the
former
resident
.
in
other
word
,
what
be
inherent
in
the
legislation
be
the
interest
of
former
resident
and
the
fund
,
by
its
nature
and
the
spirit
in
which
it
be
set
up
,
be
to
look
after
the
need
of
people
in
term
of
counselling
service
.
the
proposal
in
amendment
no.
10
that
a
one
-
off
payment
be
make
from
the
fund
be
not
acceptable
give
that
there
be
no
apparent
linkage
with
the
need
of
a
former
resident
.
the
purpose
of
the
fund
be
not
,
and
never
be
,
a
form
of
additional
compensation
.
that
issue
have
be
deal
with
by
the
redress
board
.
it
be
,
as
advocate
in
the
original
motion
pass
by
the
House
,
intend
for
the
support
of
victim
.
eligible
former
resident
will
have
a
range
of
need
,
with
some
likely
to
require
more
significant
intervention
than
other
,
and
the
approach
set
out
in
the
Bill
be
intend
to
support
this
need
.
on
that
basis
,
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
I
would
like
to
open
this
up
a
little
because
it
be
worthy
of
discussion
.
we
agree
counselling
be
a
statutory
entitlement
provide
by
the
National
Counselling
Service
.
if
it
be
a
statutory
entitlement
,
I
do
not
see
the
need
for
this
amendment
,
and
I
say
that
respectfully
because
there
be
a
class
of
approve
service
in
section
8
.
I
do
not
dispute
the
point
make
by
the
Deputy
and
I
understand
the
spirit
in
which
the
amendment
be
tab
.
my
instinct
be
perhaps
to
look
at
this
on
report
stage
but
clarity
around
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
need
.
I
understand
the
point
make
in
regard
to
fear
people
have
about
autonomy
and
so
on
.
be
there
a
inherent
fear
that
somehow
the
service
will
be
reduce
or
withdraw
at
some
future
date
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
perhaps
this
can
be
revisit
at
a
late
stage
and
further
clarification
can
be
provide
by
the
minister
.
I
would
like
to
ensure
deputy
Crowe
,
or
any
deputy
,
have
access
at
all
time
to
the
official
in
the
Department
.
if
deputy
Crowe
wish
to
discuss
that
specific
issue
with
the
official
,
there
be
no
problem
.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
be
to
require
the
board
to
make
information
available
in
regard
to
its
function
to
all
applicant
to
the
redress
board
.
as
the
deputy
will
be
aware
,
more
than
900
application
to
the
redress
board
be
withdraw
,
refuse
or
result
in
no
award
generally
on
the
grounds
that
they
be
not
resident
in
schedule
institution
as
define
in
the
act
.
I
do
not
believe
the
amendment
be
require
.
there
be
no
need
to
contact
the
900
plus
person
to
whom
I
refer
as
they
will
not
be
eligible
to
benefit
from
the
fund
.
furthermore
,
there
be
no
mechanism
for
do
so
due
to
the
confidentiality
restriction
of
the
redress
process
.
the
intention
of
the
scheme
be
to
oblige
the
board
to
make
information
available
on
its
function
to
former
resident
.
I
respectfully
argue
that
the
amendment
be
not
necessary
and
,
therefore
,
I
can
not
accept
it
.
I
will
respond
to
the
amendment
first
and
will
then
maybe
engage
further
with
deputy
Crowe
on
it
.
the
amendment
propose
would
require
the
board
to
correspond
with
all
applicant
who
apply
to
the
redress
board
,
even
that
who
do
not
receive
a
award
.
as
I
say
in
regard
to
the
previous
amendment
,
it
be
not
permissible
to
contact
individual
recipient
of
redress
board
award
due
to
the
confidentiality
provision
of
the
2002
Act
.
the
Bill
empower
the
redress
board
to
provide
awardee
's
name
,
address
and
date
of
birth
to
the
statutory
fund
which
will
enable
the
fund
to
verify
applicant
's
entitlement
to
apply
.
that
be
the
only
purpose
for
which
the
information
can
be
use
.
the
Attorney
General
's
office
have
advise
that
any
direct
unsolicited
communication
with
survivor
could
be
open
to
a
challenge
as
it
might
encroach
on
they
right
to
privacy
under
the
Constitution
and
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
.
the
redress
board
process
be
strictly
confidential
with
the
unauthorised
disclosure
of
information
be
a
criminal
offence
under
the
2002
residential
Institution
Redress
Act
.
apart
from
the
strict
legal
issue
,
the
deputy
will
also
be
aware
that
issue
relate
to
abuse
be
extremely
sensitive
and
the
send
of
unsolicited
letter
to
person
's
private
address
could
pose
difficulty
.
as
be
note
on
second
Stage
,
some
survivor
have
still
not
tell
they
partner
what
they
experience
in
childhood
.
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
deputy
Crowe
make
and
the
spirit
in
which
the
amendment
be
tab
.
I
utterly
agree
with
the
sincerity
of
the
amendment
.
I
accept
the
point
make
by
deputy
Crowe
and
he
desire
to
ensure
we
learn
from
the
mistake
of
the
past
and
provide
for
a
degree
of
probity
in
this
matter
.
the
amendment
appear
to
require
the
board
to
engage
consultant
only
by
way
of
fix
-
term
contract
and
provide
for
a
annual
review
mechanism
involve
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
while
I
appreciate
that
the
objective
behind
the
amendment
may
be
to
restrict
in
some
way
the
use
of
consultant
,
a
legislative
approach
be
not
appropriate
for
such
a
matter
.
the
amendment
appear
to
assume
that
consultant
and
legal
adviser
will
be
appoint
on
a
regular
basis
.
it
be
not
clear
on
what
basis
this
assumption
be
make
.
it
be
the
government
's
intention
that
the
use
of
such
external
adviser
be
keep
to
a
minimum
,
while
enable
the
board
to
fulfil
its
mandate
.
the
use
of
fix
-
term
contract
may
not
be
the
most
appropriate
or
cost
-
effective
way
to
bring
in
such
expertise
.
the
board
should
be
give
flexibility
to
choose
the
most
appropriate
way
of
deal
with
the
issue
,
subject
to
overall
public
service
guideline
in
this
matter
.
the
board
will
require
ministerial
approval
to
enter
into
contract
or
engage
consultant
.
I
believe
this
be
sufficient
oversight
of
the
arrangement
.
section
7(

)
state
:
in
perform
any
function
confer
on
it
by
or
under
this
act
,
the
board
shall
have
regard
to
the
existence
of
publicly
available
service
and
the
need
to
secure
the
most
beneficial
,
effective
and
efficient
use
of
the
resource
available
in
the
investment
account
.
we
would
argue
that
the
subsection
would
sufficiently
cover
the
spirit
of
the
point
raise
by
deputy
Crowe
.
I
see
where
the
deputy
be
come
from
.
perhaps
there
could
be
further
consultation
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
if
the
amendment
be
withdraw
,
on
how
the
matter
could
be
clarify
to
ensure
the
deputy
's
concern
be
address
.
I
refer
member
to
section
10
(
1
)
in
respect
of
direction
of
the
minister
,
which
state
:
the
minister
may
,
in
relation
to
the
performance
by
the
board
of
its
function
,
give
a
direction
in
writing
to
the
board
require
it
to
comply
with
such
policy
of
the
government
as
be
specify
in
the
direction
.
the
power
of
the
minister
be
clear
in
term
of
give
the
direction
but
in
keep
with
the
concern
raise
by
the
Deputy
,
this
be
a
matter
that
could
be
discuss
at
a
late
stage
.
we
discuss
this
issue
during
the
debate
on
amendment
no.
7
.
the
effect
of
this
amendment
would
be
to
extend
eligibility
for
the
fund
to
the
child
and
grandchild
of
former
resident
in
so
far
as
educational
service
be
concerned
.
they
would
also
include
employment
opportunity
.
I
be
aware
that
the
Education
Finance
Board
provide
significant
support
both
to
former
resident
and
they
relative
and
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
the
€
12.7
million
fund
set
aside
for
educational
purpose
under
the
2002
indemnity
agreement
be
now
virtually
exhaust
.
through
this
Bill
,
the
government
be
now
focus
on
meet
the
need
of
former
resident
across
a
range
of
service
area
,
have
regard
to
the
available
money
and
the
potential
number
eligible
to
apply
.
I
believe
that
to
do
this
effectively
,
it
must
confine
itself
to
the
eligible
former
resident
.
on
that
basis
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
there
be
not
unanimity
across
group
represent
survivor
on
this
particular
issue
.
the
fund
be
€
110
million
and
there
be
15000
potential
beneficiary
,
but
there
be
also
the
student
grant
scheme
which
have
income
threshold
,
and
41
%
of
full
-
time
undergraduate
high
education
student
be
in
receipt
of
such
grant
.
therefore
,
there
be
statutory
scheme
in
place
already
with
clear
income
threshold
for
which
the
child
and
grandchild
of
the
former
resident
be
eligible
.
I
would
again
like
to
restate
that
a
review
of
eligibility
under
the
fund
be
possible
if
the
demand
be
not
significant
.
that
be
where
the
review
element
of
this
come
in
and
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
will
respond
to
it
at
a
further
stage
.
we
be
say
that
we
cannot
accept
the
amendment
,
but
there
could
be
further
discussion
of
this
at
a
late
stage
.
however
,
I
think
the
minister
be
clear
about
this
on
second
Stage
.
can
the
deputy
clarify
the
2.8
%
figure
?
how
do
we
know
that
?
the
confidentiality
arrangement
inherent
within
the
initial
redress
scheme
-----
be
it
the-----
I
be
not
dispute
it
,
but
I
would
like
to
seek
clarification
on
that
.
if
there
be
a
withdrawal
of
the
amendment
at
this
juncture
-----
there
could
be
further
discussion
without
prejudice
to
see
if
the
minister
could
take
it
on
board
at
a
late
stage
.
it
be
important
to
remember
that
the
€
12.7
million
fund
set
aside
for
educational
purpose
be
virtually
exhaust
,
and
this
must
be
borne
in
mind
for
this
process
.
we
have
speak
about
the
issue
.
we
have
be
very
specific
about
the
€
12.7
million
fund
and
the
fact
that
there
be
a
significant
fund
available
for
educational
attainment
through
the
Education
Finance
Board
.
in
fairness
,
the
State
have
give
a
clear
commitment
on
that
so
the
State
's
response
be
measure
in
that
sense
.
however
,
there
be
scope
to
have
further
discussion
on
the
issue
raise
in
amendment
Nosemcue
7
,
15
and
16
and
the
minister
will
give
a
clear
direction
on
they
at
a
late
stage
.
I
speak
to
the
spirit
of
everything
that
have
be
say
today
.
no
one
with
a
shred
of
humanity
in
he
heart
would
disagree
or
fail
to
empathise
with
what
be
be
say
but
I
must
be
clear
about
the
scope
of
the
Bill
.
it
go
beyond
its
scope
to
introduce
a
statutory
entitlement
.
nevertheless
I
take
in
good
faith
the
argument
make
.
this
amendment
have
be
disallow
.
however
,
on
report
stage
there
should
be
a
conversation
on
meet
the
physical
need
,
include
housing
and
shelter
of
person
who
find
themselves
in
this
morass
.
liais
mechanism
have
be
set
up
and
be
available
try
to
assist
people
with
this
physical
need
.
this
be
already
inherent
and
available
under
various
other
pillar
.
for
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
there
be
no
plan
to
introduce
a
statutory
entitlement
.
the
amendment
have
be
disallow
but
give
the
progress
of
the
legislation
it
should
give
rise
to
a
further
discussion
on
report
stage
.
that
be
the
good
we
can
do
at
this
stage
.
deputy
Daly
propose
the
deletion
of
section
8
(
4
)
in
its
entirety
.
the
subsection
be
a
important
provision
,
however
,
in
that
it
give
the
board
the
flexibility
to
determine
different
class
.
this
be
class
not
in
a
class
sense
as
we
understand
it
but
in
term
of
try
to
define
a
range
of
subject
,
service
,
people
or
former
resident
.
it
provide
the
board
with
flexibility
,
therefore
,
in
term
of
the
determination
of
service
.
for
example
,
it
could
set
different
entitlement
depend
on
the
age
of
former
resident
.
it
be
not
intend
to
be
restrictive
or
exclusive
;
the
opposite
be
the
case
.
it
be
design
to
give
the
board
the
flexibility
it
need
to
meet
the
wide
range
of
need
of
former
resident
.
I
be
rather
concerned
at
the
proposal
to
delete
the
wording
set
out
in
the
Bill
and
I
oppose
the
amendment
on
that
basis
.
language
be
all
important
in
this
process
.
ultimately
,
this
section
serve
to
ensure
that
a
flexibility
be
available
.
it
be
like
refer
to
a
class
of
car
.
it
speak
to
the
range
of
service
and
there
should
be
some
flexibility
inherent
in
it
.
the
word
be
use
from
a
legislative
point
of
view
.
with
respect
to
the
deputy
,
I
suggest
the
word
"
type
"
be
bad
because
a
"
type
"
of
former
resident
could
be
deem
in
certain
circumstance
to
be
interpret
as
pejorative
as
well
.
let
we
normalise
the
word
"
class
"
here
and
now
:
it
be
a
normal
word
.
there
be
no
subjective
nature
to
it
.
the
spirit
of
the
word
"
class
"
in
this
sense
be
to
ensure
there
be
flexibility
around
the
range
of
service
that
can
be
provide
.
I
be
unsure
whether
another
word
could
be
use
.
"
Class
"
be
a
rather
innocuous
word
and
no
offence
be
intend
by
it
.
for
the
purpose
of
design
the
legislation
it
give
flexibility
in
term
of
the
determination
of
service
.
it
be
important
to
nail
this
down
so
that
there
be
no
misinterpretation
.
let
we
suppose
we
be
discuss
social
protection
legislation
for
the
over
70
.
that
segment
of
the
population
would
be
class
as
the
over
70
.
it
be
a
class
of
the
population
.
with
all
due
respect
,
one
must
class
subsection
when
deal
with
legislation
.
the
aim
in
this
instance
be
to
ensure
flexibility
in
the
determination
of
service
.
if
the
service
be
be
define
,
there
have
to
be
a
class
of
service
or
category
.
there
be
nothing
pejorative
or
demeaning
in
the
use
of
the
word
"
class
"
in
this
instance
.
it
do
not
seek
to
stigmatise
anyone
in
any
way
;
that
be
not
the
intent
in
the
use
of
the
word
.
the
effect
of
the
amendment
would
be
to
preclude
the
board
from
include
in
its
criterion
a
provision
that
would
require
it
to
take
into
consideration
the
financial
circumstance
of
a
applicant
.
the
purpose
of
the
fund
be
to
allow
it
to
target
the
need
of
former
resident
.
by
remove
the
power
of
the
board
to
include
financial
circumstance
in
its
criterion
potentially
it
would
allow
a
former
resident
with
extensive
means
to
apply
to
the
board
and
receive
support
and
service
on
the
same
basis
as
a
less
wealthy
individual
,
whereas
the
objective
be
to
meet
the
need
of
that
most
in
need
.
I
emphasise
that
this
provision
be
not
intend
to
introduce
a
general
means
test
application
to
the
fund
.
it
will
be
a
matter
for
the
fund
to
have
regard
to
the
need
to
take
account
of
a
individual
's
financial
circumstance
when
determine
its
criterion
for
its
decision
.
this
provision
be
most
assuredly
not
intend
as
a
way
of
prevent
vulnerable
person
in
need
from
benefit
from
the
support
that
will
be
available
under
the
fund
.
therefore
,
I
cannot
support
the
amendment
.
section
14
(
9
)
allow
the
board
to
designate
a
staff
member
to
perform
the
function
of
the
chief
executive
officer
in
the
event
of
that
officer
be
absence
or
the
position
be
vacant
.
this
be
a
reasonable
provision
and
while
such
situation
may
be
rare
,
they
may
occur
from
time
to
time
.
the
amendment
would
have
the
effect
of
prevent
any
member
of
staff
,
include
one
designate
by
the
board
under
section
14
to
perform
the
function
of
the
chief
executive
officer
,
from
give
evidence
before
a
committee
of
Dáil
Éireann
.
I
find
the
proposal
a
little
strange
and
I
be
unclear
why
a
acting
chief
executive
officer
could
not
come
before
a
Oireachtas
committee
to
answer
question
on
various
issue
.
the
deputy
be
suggest
that
if
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
wish
to
examine
issue
relate
to
the
book
and
account
of
the
fund
,
it
should
be
preclude
from
call
the
senior
staff
member
of
the
fund
to
appear
before
it
.
I
be
unclear
why
the
fund
should
be
treat
differently
from
other
public
body
.
we
be
all
commit
to
ensure
full
accountability
and
I
be
not
sure
the
amendment
would
sustain
that
level
of
accountability
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
that
have
be
make
.
one
might
interpret
the
amendment
as
make
a
certain
point
about
the
power
of
the
Oireachtas
in
term
of
summon
witness
before
it
.
I
refer
here
to
the
spirit
as
oppose
to
the
letter
of
the
law
.
the
reality
,
however
,
be
that
there
be
no
precedent
,
in
so
far
as
I
be
aware
,
where
a
chief
executive
officer
of
a
statutory
body
or
fund
have
fail
to
appear
before
the
Oireachtas
on
be
summon
.
it
be
pertinent
and
proper
to
ensure
that
the
board
can
designate
its
staff
to
perform
the
function
of
the
chief
executive
officer
in
the
event
of
the
latter
's
absence
or
the
position
be
vacant
.
that
be
common
sense
.
the
board
could
likewise
decide
to
take
that
action
.
the
key
point
here
be
that
we
should
not
undermine
we
own
role
as
legislator
in
term
of
the
ability
to
summon
people
before
we
,
as
per
deputy
Smith
's
point
.
I
acknowledge
the
argument
he
have
make
in
that
sense
.
I
cannot
accept
the
deputy
's
amendment
.
despite
the
difficult
economic
circumstance
,
a
cap
of
€
5000
per
annum
on
the
remuneration
,
allowance
and
expense
of
the
staff
of
the
board
would
be
punitive
.
I
do
not
know
whether
the
deputy
have
include
the
amendment
under
this
section
in
error
.
subsection
(
4
)
state

the
member
of
the

shall
,
subject
to
the

of
this

hold

and
condition
(

as
may
be
determine
by
the

,
with
the
approval
of
the

.
there
be
no
provision
in
the
Bill
for
remuneration
of

member
.
to
clarify
,
they
will
be

only
to

it

deputy
Crowe
's
amendment
relate
to
section
17
,
the
provision
of
which
relate
to
the
staff
of
the
board
.
there
be
a
distinction
between
person
employ
as
administrator
and
that
who
be
member
of
the
board
.
what
be
propose
here
might
not
be
deem
to
be
a
charge
on
the
exchequer
for
the
purpose
of
consider
the
amendment
but
it
would
be
hugely
costly
to
undertake
large
print
run
of
the
report
in
order
to
furnish
copy
to
every
public
library
across
the
State
.
it
be
the
norm
in
this
day
and
age
that
annual
report
and
other
public
document
be
publish
electronically
and
access
online
.
the
amendment
also
place
a
requirement
on
the
board
that
the
placement
of
the
report
in
public
library
be
advertise
in
local
and
national
newspaper
.
that
potential
cost
alone
oblige
I
to
reject
the
amendment
.
there
be
sufficient
way
of
bring
report
of
this
nature
into
the
public
domain
.
the
cost
of
disseminate
they
to
local
library
and
advertising
same
would
be
utterly
prohibitive
.
the
question
arise
as
to
who
would
fund
that
cost
and
how
it
would
be
determine
.
I
assure
member
that
I
acknowledge
the
spirit
of
the
proposal
they
have
bring
forward
.
I
appreciate
that
deputy
Crowe
be
endeavour
to
ensure
that
any
payment
make
to
former
resident
will
not
affect
they
social
welfare
entitlement
in
this
jurisdiction
or
outside
the
State
.
I
be
sympathetic
to
the
general
principle
involve
.
however
,
I
do
not
believe
that
this
legislation
be
the
appropriate
vehicle
to
address
the
concern
raise
.
the
board
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
ensure
a
outcome
such
as
that
intend
.
a
amendment
to
the
social
welfare
regulation
would
,
if
deem
necessary
,
be
more
appropriate
.
this
issue
could
certainly
be
pursue
in
the
event
that
difficulty
emerge
down
the
line
.
the
deputy
will
also
appreciate
that
the
Oireachtas
cannot
legislate
in
respect
of
the
affair
of
other
jurisdiction
.
a
provision
such
as
that
be
propose
be
unenforceable
.
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
on
that
basis
.
let
we
keep
in
mind
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
,
namely
,
to
provide
service
in
the
first
instance
.
if
the
deputy
be
suggest
that
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
the
Department
of
social
Protection
should
liaise
further
in
respect
of
the
issue
he
have
outline
,
I
be
of
the
view
that
this
should
be
do
prior
to
report
stage
.
if
the
deputy
so
wish
,
we
can
engage
in
such
a
exercise
.
if
it
relate
to
matter
outside
the
jurisdiction
,
then
it
would
be
unenforceable
.
again
,
let
we
keep
in
mind
that
the
fund
be
design
to
assist
and
be
proactive
in
term
of
meet
people
's
need
.
it
be
not
mean
to
place
a
block
in
the
way
of
application
.
the
amendment
seek
to
delete
section
20
(
4
)
(
b
)
,
the
provision
contain
in
which
be
reasonable
in
the
context
of
assist
the
board
in
consider
application
.
it
be
not
unreasonable
for
the
board
to
seek
certain
basic
information
or
consent
from
applicant
.
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
information
will
be
seek
for
the
purpose
of
assist
in
the
consideration
of
application
.
if
a
applicant
fail
to
provide
information
,
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
board
to
refuse
to
consider
the
matter
further
until
such
information
be
provide
.
it
be
on
this
basis
that
we
cannot
accept
the
amendment
.
if
the
deputy
be
seek
to
soften
the
language
use
or
the
approach
be
take
,
I
can
appreciate
what
she
be
try
to
do
.
again
,
however
,
we
must
have
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
fund
be
design
to
assist
people
in
a
positive
fashion
.
one
cannot
then
be
prescriptive
or
set
out
schedule
as
to
how
people
in
vary
circumstance
should
be
deal
with
.
that
may
not
be
what
the
deputy
be
drive
at
but
she
can
clarify
the
position
when
she
respond
.
I
accept
that
there
be
sensitivity
involve
but
we
must
create
a
scenario
whereby
employee
of
the
fund
who
be
deal
with
request
for
funding
or
a
service
will
be
allow
to
gather
any
information
which
may
be
require
.
it
be
also
necessary
to
put
in
place
structure
to
deal
with
instance
where
request
for
such
information
be
refuse
,
namely
,
a
application
will
not
proceed
unless
the
require
information
be
furnish
.
I
be
of
the
opinion
that
this
be
reasonable
because
,
by
its
very
nature
,
the
fund
be
design
to
assist
people
.
I
be
go
to
stick
to
my
gun
on
this
one
on
the
basis
that
this
be
enable
legislation
.
to
use
the
example
of
medical
circumstance
where
assistance
be
be
provide
in
that
respect
,
one
must
have
regard
to
a
individual
's
medical
circumstance
.
if
one
do
not
have
the
information
,
one
cannot
make
a
determination
and
proceed
any
further
with
a
application
.
once
the
fund
be
set
up
,
one
must
have
a
mechanism
to
provide
structure
to
allow
the
board
to
refuse
to
consider
a
applicant
if
the
person
be
remiss
in
not
yield
certain
information
.
there
must
be
a
degree
of
co-operation
,
otherwise
the
process
become
intractable
.
one
could
have
a
body
of
case
await
a
determination
that
could
drag
on
for
year
.
we
need
to
be
able
to
expedite
every
case
efficiently
to
ensure
that
that
who
will
become
client
of
the
service
want
to
ensure
there
be
a
efficiency
build
into
the
service
in
order
that
it
run
smoothly
and
in
they
favour
.
I
do
not
believe
there
be
anything
wrong
with
what
be
be
suggest
in
subsection
4
(
b
)
.
it
state
,
''
enable
the
board
to
refuse
to
further
consider
the
application
if
the
request
under
paragraph
(
a
)
be

with
and
the
board
may
so
request
or
refuse
to
further
consider
the
application
in
accordance
with
the
procedure
''
.
any
public
servant
I
know
of
who
deal
on
a
front
-
of
-
house
basis
with
individual
or
fellow
citizen
will
seek
to
assist
a
person
along
but
if
the
person
do
not
co-operate
or
stonewall
in
term
of
provide
particular
information
,
there
come
a
time
when
one
must
make
a
call
on
it
,
and
this
provision
allow
for
that
.
one
must
reflect
on
the
spirit
of
the
legislation
.
the
Bill
be

try

by
its

no
,
not
at
this
stage
.
I
would
point
out
that

the
unauthorised

of
information
and
provide
for
it
to
be
a
criminal
offence
.

it

I
fail
to
see
that
either
of
this
amendment
be
necessary
or
that
they
add
to
the
Bill
.
I
do
not
see
that
there
be
anything
to
be
gain
by
inform
a
applicant
that
information
be
be

and
perhaps
there
be
much
to
be
lose
,
particularly
if
sensitive

to

bring
to
the
attention
of
the
statutory
authority

give
that
the
provision
of
section
24
be
already
restrictive
,
the
amendment
be
unnecessary
and
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
either
amendment
.
I
will
get
a
explanation
for
the
deputy
and
we
can
revert
to
she
.

that

I
do
not

determine

in

on

of

that

to
a

that
could
reasonably
lead
to
the
identification
of

in
term
of

,
we
seek
to
introduce
a
belt
and
brace
approach
to
how

deal
with
to
ensure
that
the
privacy
of

that
be
already
inherent
within

section
as
lay
out
in
the

.
that
be
it
.
the
amendment
to
section
31
propose
that
no
disclosure
shall
be
make
prior
to
inform
the
applicant
.
I
suggest
that
one
must
think
carefully
about
how
one
would
communicate
that
,
to
whom
and
to
which
house
it
would
go
.
one
must
still
have
a
degree
of
security
around
ensure
that
no
third
party
could
potentially
have
access
to
the
information
if
,
for
example
,
a
person
change
address
.
one
must
be
careful
to
ensure
one
do
not
compromise
the
confidentiality
that
exist
.
again
,
if
the
deputy
look
at
section

on

,
a
person
do
not
contravene
section

if
the
disclosure
be
make
to
or
authorise
by
the

where
the

and
reasonably
believe
that

to
prevent

a
serious

,
or
be
make
to
a

the

section

(

)
(d
)
and
(
email
)
be
also
relevant
.
we
feel
strongly
that
the
legislation
be
sufficient
in
term
of
the
disclosure
of
information
as
per
deputy
Daly
's
amendment
no.
32
,
but
in

31
,
by
virtue
of
section
23
(

it
be
set
out
how
one
must
be
careful
about
how
one
communicate
.
nobody
would
disagree
with
the
deputy
.
there
be
no
question
that
we
all
share
that
sentiment
.
I
appreciate
the
motivation
behind
the
amendment
.
I
cannot
accept
the
amendment
because
under
the
term
of
the
indemnity
agreement
reach
with
the
religious
congregation
and
the
then
government
on

marketable

all
of
this

nevertheless
,

and

to
finalise
the

process
under
the
term
of
the

agreement
.
in
the
event
of
a
shortfall
regard
the
value
of
the
property

and
that
provide
under

agreement
,
the

while
one
cannot
put
a
timeframe
on

due
to
the
complex
nature
of
the
remain

,
I
can
assure
the
committee
,
as
the

,
deputy
Quinn
,
have
assure
it

that
every
effort
be

however
,
deputy
Daly
may
wish
to
withdraw
the
amendment
in

of
the
explanation
.
I
can
advise
the
committee
in

that

250000

I
wish
to

a
further
technical

of

thank

I
be
grateful
to
you
for
you
forbearance
in
allow
I
to
speak
to
the
amendment
.
my
colleague
,
deputy
Duncan
Smith
,
receive
correspondence
from
you
on
2
June
where
you
express
regret
at
the
fact
that
amendment
no.
97
be
not
relevant
to
the
provision
of
the
Bill
,
could
impose
a
charge
on
the
revenue
and
must
be
rule
out
of
order
in
accordance
with
standing
order
187
(
1
)
and
212(
3
)
.
we
put
forward
this
amendment
on
the
basis
that
we
wish
to
support
the
government
's
attempt
to
ensure
there
be
a
meaningful
piece
of
legislation
on
climate
action
and
low
carbon
development
.
I
merely
wish
,
from
a
procedural
point
of
view
,
to
understand
the
logic
of
disallow
the
amendment
,
which
seek
a
sectoral
adaptation
plan
in
respect
of
afforestation
and
target
therein
,
and
similarly
in
respect
of
the
remediation
of
bog
without
imping
whatsoever
on
individual
's
turbary
rights
,
in
the
first
instance
.
I
would
hope
that
the
chairman
or
perhaps
the
minister
of
State
could
help
my
understanding
of
the
logic
behind
the
decision
to
disallow
the
amendment
in
the
first
place
.
that
be
merely
what
I
wish
to
ascertain
.
second
,
and
depend
on
the
answer
to
that
,
I
do
not
see
how
a
sectoral
adaptation
plan
in
relation
to
afforestation
which
I
would
consider
to
be
germane
to
the
issue
of
climate
action
could
be
injurious
to
a
Bill
of
this
nature
unless
,
of
course
,
it
be
a
matter
of
interpret
the
Minister
of
State
's
position
thus
far
,
which
be
that
"
not
...
everything
...
need
to
be
stuff
into
this
Bill
"
.
I
would
have
think
that
afforestation
target
be
absolutely
germane
to
this
legislation
.
while
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
Senator
Hackett
,
in
relation
to
she
current
afforestation
travail
,
notwithstand
the
challenge
in
relation
to
licensing
,
the
Labour
Party
strongly
feel
there
be
a
issue
here
that
be
absolutely
germane
to
the
issue
of
climate
action
.
I
wish
to
seek
a
justification
for
rule
that
amendment
out
of
order
.
thank
you
,
chair
,
for
allow
I
to
intercede
.
I
appreciate
it
.
thank
you
,
Chairman
.
may
I
make
just
one
very
brief
intervention
in
ten
second
or
less
?
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
respond
to
I
,
I
would
be
ever
so
grateful
.
the
Bill
,
by
its
nature
,
in
term
of
what
it
seek
to
do
,
could
be
argue
to
impose
a
charge
on
the
revenue
if
you
take
some
of
that
amendment
that
have
be
accept
.
I
refer
to
the
interpretation
here
.
I
would
love
to
have
see
the
advice
of
the
Oireachtas
official
in
respect
of
this
one
.
I
wish
merely
to
argue
that
every
action
in
here
and
within
this
legislation
where
amendment
be
accept
could
arguably
impose
a
charge
on
the
revenue
.
we
find
the
decoupling
of
afforestation
target
from
this
legislation
to
be
extremely
incongruous
to
the
spirit
of
the
legislation
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
give
I
some
response
or
some
word
of
comfort
regard
the
effect
of
afforestation
target
-
this
be
a
major
issue
now
-
I
would
gladly
accept
that
comment
.
indeed
,
I
would
gladly
accept
any
offer
that
the
Minister
of
State
might
make
for
further
engagement
on
the
issue
.
chair
,
I
thank
you
again
for
you
patience
.
that
be
a
pity
.
thank
you
,
chair
.
one
would
always
accept
the
ruling
of
the
chair
and
one
would
always
be
deferential
to
the
chair
.
I
implore
you
to
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
the
issue
of
afforestation
target
in
particular
.
that
would
give
we
a
sense
,
while
promulgate
this
legislation
,
of
where
the
Minister
of
State
stand
in
respect
of
afforestation
target
in
particular
.
I
think
that
would
be
really
useful
.

the
phrase
of
employ
a
unregistered
person
"
in

of

be
use
in
certain
place
in
the
new
section

in

in

the
reality
be
that
in
the
very
limited
exception
in
which
the
employment
of
a

will
be
permit
,
that

will

the

simply
design
to
reflect
this
.
the
fact
that
a

employ
in
such
a

do
not
make
he
or

a

.
the
amendment
propose
be
therefore
unnecessary
and
I
do
not
propose
to
accept

we
must
defer
to
the
expertise
of
the
deputy
in
this
area
.
if
one
be
to
look
at
the
Teaching
Council
,
one
could
argue
that
the
Teaching
Council
and
this
committee
should
have
a
qualitative
analysis
of
the
role
of
the
Teaching
Council
in
May
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
controversial
.
some

of

Council

teacher
or
be
ally
to
the
teaching
profession
through
representative
organisation
.
rather
than
the
State
or
the
Department
deal
with
qualitative
issue
,
the
conversation
could
happen
in
the
committee
.
with
due
respect
to
deputy
Mitchell
O'Connor
,
I
cannot
comment
on
the
outcome
or
the
number
of
people
who
vote
in
election
.
I
take
the
point
that
the
low
turnout
may
reflect
a
certain
annoyance
.
the
way
to
deal
with
this
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
suggest
it
,
be
for
the
committee
to
engage
with
the
Teaching
Council
on
its
qualitative
role
.
with
22
of
the
37
member
of
the

to
the
teaching
profession
,
many
thing
can
be
work
out
.
the
new
board
be
in
situ
,
which
should
give
grounds
for
hope

it
could
serve
as
a
potential

the

there
be
a
dialogue
to

have
on

be

I
will
relate

how

directly
on

section

the
rationale

to

the
provision

Teaching

prohibit
the
payment
of

it

to
employ

therefore
,
the
pay
of

protection
for
school
against
a
unfair
dismissal
claim
along
the
line
be
advocate
by
this
amendment
would
be
arbitrary
and
disproportionate
.
it
would
mean
that
a
person
whose
registration
lapse
for
even
one
day
could
be
dismiss
summarily
and
without
recourse
to
the
employment
appeal
Tribunal
.
the
circumstance
which
may
arise
may
be
as
vary
as
a
teacher
allow
he
or
she
registration
to
lapse
for
a
small
number
of
day
due
to
a
circumstance
where
a
individual
do
nothing
about

register
.
where
a
person
be
unregistered
for

small
number
of
day

then
become

he

should
be

job

where
there
be
a
long
period
during

the

person
be
prevent
from

by
the
State
,
he
or

may
wish
to

unpaid
leave
,
such
as
a
career
break
,
to
gain
the
necessary
qualification
to
become

the
Teaching
Council
.
under
this
circumstance
,
no
termination
of
the

take
place

he

she
simply
cannot
be

even
in
this
scenario
a
person
should
still
expect
to
have
the
normal
law
protection
,
include
access
to
the
employment

for
a

claim
.
interpose
the
minister
in
the

contract
by
essentially
permit
the
immediate
dismissal
with
impunity
of
a
teacher
who
have
allow
he

counter

a
one

unjust

give

a
licence
to
dismiss
teacher
without
scrutiny

constitute
a
indiscriminate
attack
on
they
employment
rights

for
this
reason
,
I
do
not

on

while
we
can
examine
some
of

that
could

to
be
honest
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
the
manner
in
which
we
have
respond
to
the
amendment
tab
by
deputy
Smith

as
I
state
,
interpose
the

in
the
employment
contract
by
essentially
permit
the
immediate
dismissal
with
impunity
of
a
teacher
who
have
let
he
or
she
registration
lapse
would
run
counter
to
the
concept
of
equal
treatment
.
the
government
be
cognisant
of
the
rights
of
employee
and
I
hope
deputy
Crowe
and
he
party
will
give
due
regard
to
this
issue
,
as
they
be
do
to
a
certain
extent
.
while
I
do
not
see
how
the
scenario
the
deputy
describe
could
arise
,
if
he
forese
certain
other
scenario
arise
,
perhaps
he
will
notify
they
to
the
Department
and
we
will
respond
accordingly
.
while
I
do
not
wish
to
open
a
discussion
on
this
matter
,
if
someone
be
dismiss
,
he
or
she
be
potentially
dismiss
with
good
reason
,
have
go
through
all
the
machinery
or
architecture
of
the
State
.
I
be
still
a
little
unclear
as
to
