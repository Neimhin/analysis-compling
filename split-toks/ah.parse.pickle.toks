deputy
Ellis
raise
important
point
,
particularly
about
send
out
notification
and
effective
communication
.
that
point
be
important
for
Irish
Water
to
take
on
board
.
the
Water
Service
Act
place
specific
responsibility
on
the
Minister
and
the
Department
of
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
,
include
responsibility
for
matter
relevant
to
water
policy
,
funding
and
in
the
making
of
regulation
.
the
water
service
act
also
put
in
place
a
variety
of
legislative
and
regulatory
control
to
ensure
governance
,
oversight
and
accountability
regard
water
service
.
Irish
Water
be
subject
to
significant
regulation
and
oversight
from
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
,
EPA
,
relate
to
environmental
compliance
and
the
CRU
,
relate
to
economic
regulation
,
include
customer
service
.
the
Oireachtas
also
establish
the
Water
Advisory
Body
to
report
to
the
Oireachtas
on
Irish
Water
's
performance
.
for
example
,
regard
the
major
boil
water
notice
arise
from
problem
at
the
Leixlip
water
treatment
plant
in
2019
,
the
CRU
carry
out
a
audit
of
the
Irish
Water
response
to
check
compliance
with
the
standard
lay
down
in
the
customer
service
handbook
.
this
audit
be
also
available
on
the
CRU
website
.
as
I
have
outline
,
Irish
Water
assure
my
Department
that
it
make
every
effort
to
deliver
on
its
responsibility
,
to
keep
service
interruption
to
the
minimum
extent
possible
,
as
well
as
to
comply
with
its
obligation
under
the
customer
service
handbook
when
communicate
with
customer
.
I
note
the
point
make
by
deputy
Ellis
.
as
I
say
,
we
can
always
improve
on
the
communication
and
on
the
level
of
service
provide
to
the
public
.
on
the
point
raise
about
McKee
Avenue
,
Finglas
,
I
understand
that
the
burst
water
main
have
now
be
repair
.
it
be
probably
the
initial
query
bring
forward
by
deputy
Ellis
.
I
thank
he
for
bring
this
issue
forward
this
evening
.
the
Labour
Party
be
support
the
Bill
.
we
wonder
why
it
be
be
kick
to
touch
for
the
period
of
time
that
be
propose
by
the
government
,
which
be
unnecessary
.
there
be
ample
time
to
deal
with
all
of
the
section
in
the
Bill
through
Committee
stage
.
any
of
the
concern
that
have
be
raise
by
the
government
,
through
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
,
could
be
deal
with
through
the
parliamentary
process
.
this
could
be
do
in
the
normal
course
of
event
.
the
Bill
be
worthy
of
support
.
it
be
measure
and
it
simply
give
retire
worker
access
to
the
Workplace
Relation
Commission
in
situation
where
they
pension
scheme
be
be
change
,
which
be
not
unreasonable
.
they
currently
have
no
representation
.
there
be
a
definite
gap
in
the
law
because
it
allow
unscrupulous
business
owner
to
make
million
in
profit
while
leave
pension
fund
underfunded
,
which
be
one
example
.
we
have
meet
group
of
public
sector
retiree
who
have
very
legitimate
grievance
.
old
public
sector
worker
do
not
pay
regular
prsi
and
do
not
have
a
entitlement
to
the
State
pension
,
so
they
do
not
benefit
from
budget
review
and
increase
in
the
pension
rate
.
they
public
sector
pension
do
not
rise
with
the
cost
of
living
so
they
value
be
be
erode
.
the
pension
fund
be
''
raid
''
post
-2008
and
be
never
restore
,
which
result
in
cut
in
real
term
to
they
pension
.
while
most
of
this
cut
be
restore
,
there
be
no
compensation
for
the
lose
year
and
that
on
the
high
pension
remain
with
low
pension
.
the
retire
semi-State
staff
association
emerge
from
the
post
-2008
scenario
when
group
of
retiree
be
encourage
to
come
together
under
one
umbrella
.
group
like
that
,
which
be
support
the
promulgation
of
this
legislation
,
have
legitimacy
.
it
be
important
to
recognise
the
legitimacy
of
this
cohort
of
people
and
all
of
the
stakeholder
who
be
support
this
Bill
because
they
represent
ten
of
thousand
of
worker
.
that
need
to
be
acknowledge
.
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
the
large
stakeholder
grouping
do
not
attach
to
one
political
party
or
ideological
association
and
,
in
fact
,
I
suggest
that
very
many
of
this
worker
would
have
traditionally
vote
for
Fianna
Fáil
and
Fine
Gael
.
that
be
why
we
feel
strongly
that
the
Bill
should
progress
through
the
dáil
at
this
stage
.
this
be
a
broad
coalition
of
stakeholder
that
reflect
what
be
happen
in
society
.
person
have
a
real
-
time
loss
of
income
and
they
merely
wish
to
have
representation
and
for
that
representation
to
be
recognise
in
law
.
that
be
not
unreasonable
.
cynically
,
one
could
say
that
,
like
any
issue
that
affect
a
historical
cohort
,
there
be
a
reflex
within
the
government
and
sometimes
within
the
Civil
Service
,
dare
I
say
it
,
and
I
say
it
be
a
former
minister
of
State
,
to
hold
tight
because
the
calculation
be
that
this
generation
will
pass
on
and
,
as
the
issue
do
not
affect
middle
aged
or
young
people
,
the
government
will
try
to
put
it
on
the
long
finger
.
I
speak
with
objectivity
because
that
be
precisely
what
be
happen
with
this
legislation
.
it
be
be
put
on
the
long
finger
and
it
be
a
de
facto
attempt
by
the
government
to
kill
it
off
in
the
long
run
.
I
do
not
think
that
be
to
anybody
's
benefit
,
particularly
give
the
range
and
breadth
of
the
stakeholder
group
that
be
involved
in
support
the
legislation
.
they
be
reflective
of
all
sector
of
society
.
we
must
always
remember
that
the
principle
of
intergenerational
solidarity
have
to
apply
.
there
must
be
that
solidarity
between
retire
former
worker
and
current
worker
,
and
this
Bill
seek
to
support
that
principle
.
we
strongly
support
the
Bill
and
we
ask
that
the
government
revise
its
decision
to
delay
its
passage
.
we
ask
the
government
,
in
principle
,
to
stop
use
this
tool
.
it
use
to
be
the
guillotine
and
now
it
be
the
six
-
month
or
12
-
month
delay
tactic
that
be
be
use
as
the
effective
tool
of
government
to
stymie
legislation
that
be
propose
by
member
on
the
Opposition
bench
.
to
be
frank
,
the
ten
of
thousand
of
worker
,
who
be
watch
this
proceedings
in
the
hope
that
the
government
would
at
least
allow
the
Bill
to
pass
second
stage
and
go
to
Committee
Stage
,
so
all
of
the
issue
raise
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
,
can
be
address
,
see
the
tactic
for
what
it
be
.
let
we
call
a
spade
a
spade
:
it
be
a
attempt
by
the
government
to
kick
the
can
down
the
line
and
kill
it
off
,
if
it
can
.
I
do
not
think
people
will
be
too
enamoured
with
Fianna
Fáil
,
Fine
Gael
and
the
Green
Party
for
employ
this
tactic
.
they
will
see
it
for
what
it
be
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
second
Stage
of
the
Industrial
Relation
(
provision
in
respect
of
Pension
Entitlement
of
retired
worker
)
Bill
2021
,
which
take
place
this
morning
.
on
the
question
,
"
that
the
amendment
to
the
motion
be
make
"
,
a
division
be
claim
,
and
in
accordance
with
Standing
Order
80
(
2
)
,
that
division
must
be
take
now
.
on
the
same
theme
,
I
merely
wish
to
ask
the
minister
the
exact
status
of
the
propose
public
tendering
of
local
employment
scheme
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
that
there
be
still
concern
,
particularly
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
have
be
work
in
the
system
?
one
person
I
know
have
be
work
in
the
system
for
over
25
year
.
I
share
the
concern
raise
.
it
have
be
express
to
I
that
if
a
person
who
be
a
client
of
the
service
do
not
reach
a
certain
metric
or
if
there
be
not
a
certain
output
in
that
person
's
case
,
perhaps
the
attainment
of
a
full
-
time
or
part
-
time
job
or
whatever
that
output
might
be
,
a
punitive
economic
measure
or
sanction
could
be
levy
against
the
person
or
client
.
that
be
a
concern
that
people
have
.
they
be
concerned
that
the
net
effect
of
the
creation
of
a
new
service
will
be
that
a
set
of
metric
will
be
put
in
place
which
specify
that
the
client
have
to
reach
certain
milestone
and
if
they
do
not
reach
that
milestone
,
payment
or
other
service
will
be
cut
off
from
the
client
.
we
be
yet
to
be
convince
.
I
say
that
respectfully
.
the
minister
have
acknowledge
that
she
predecessor
attend
the
Irish
local
Development
Network
,
ILDN
,
conference
in
2018
.
I
request
that
the
minister
consider
meet
the
ILDN
and
trade
union
representative
follow
the
outcome
of
the
first
request
for
tender
process
and
before
the
second
request
for
tender
process
begin
.
I
be
make
that
request
because
I
believe
there
will
be
learning
from
the
first
request
for
tender
process
.
the
minister
state
previously
to
deputy
Kerrane
that
she
official
have
meet
various
representative
group
.
if
the
minister
would
consider
personally
meet
trade
union
representative
and
the
ILDN
,
that
would
be
welcome
.
the
employer
and
union
be
on
the
same
page
,
in
this
instance
.
I
share
the
concern
deputy
Calleary
outline
about
the
risk
that
we
feel
be
inherent
in
this
that
the
outcome
of
the
negotiation
will
be
such
that
the
amount
pay
to
retiree
would
be
derisory
,
rendering
the
process
almost
null
and
void
in
the
context
of
the
pound
of
flesh
that
supervisor
have
give
through
they
year
of
service
.
the
government
should
not
at
the
end
of
this
process
be
level
with
the
charge
that
it
be
a
token
process
.
the
process
have
to
be
such
that
the
amount
of
money
that
will
be
award
to
people
will
be
commensurate
with
they
year
of
service
and
meaningful
for
that
people
.
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
the
Minister
in
the
Department
and
accept
the
fact
that
there
be
a
process
to
be
go
through
in
respect
of
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
but
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
ensure
that
the
money
that
be
pay
at
the
end
of
the
day
will
be
meaningful
give
the
supervisor
's
year
of
service
.
we
know
this
people
.
they
live
within
we
community
and
we
know
the
work
they
do
.
we
deal
with
they
every
day
of
the
week
.
they
be
of
we
and
we
neighbour
.
the
work
they
do
cannot
be
measure
easily
in
metric
but
we
all
know
instinctively
its
value
,
sometimes
over
decade
in
the
case
of
some
supervisor
.
I
reiterate
the
call
that
have
be
make
that
the
process
and
outcome
have
to
be
meaningful
in
term
of
financial
recognition
of
that
service
.
all
of
we
in
the
political
landscape
openly
acknowledge
the
role
of
community
employment
scheme
.
we
recognise
the
value
that
they
have
bring
to
the
public
realm
and
otherwise
.
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
if
the
outcome
of
this
process
be
such
that
people
feel
they
personal
dignity
,
as
worker
,
be
undermine
by
a
derisory
package
.
I
implore
the
Minister
of
State
,
and
I
know
he
will
take
this
into
account
,
to
reflect
that
work
in
a
package
that
be
commensurate
with
year
of
service
.
I
thank
deputy
Pringle
.
he
be
become
quite
adept
at
get
he

Member
's

House

I

I
might
be
look
for
one
.
while
I
have
the
floor
,
I
beg
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
indulgence
on
a
small
matter
of
etiquette
and
good
manners
.
I
notice
over
the
summer
period
the
number
of
minister
-
Fianna
Fáil
Minister
in
particular
-
who
have
be
traverse
the
country
and
avail
of
opportunity
to
visit
constituency
.
a
number
of
they
visit
my
constituency
and
I
be
happy
to
see
they
there
,
but
they
do
not
extend
the
courtesy
of
notify
all
Member
of
the
Oireachtas
when
they
visit
constituency
.
I
would
not
call
it
a
protocol
but
there
be
a
convention
of
etiquette
and
good
manners
such
that
minister
at
least
notify
all
member
of
the
Oireachtas
when
they
be
visit
constituency
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
welcome
that
the
new
regulatory
body
,
MARA
,
will
be
set
up
in
Wexford
town
.
it
will
be
a
fine
location
for
the
regulatory
body
and
key
personnel
.
I
would
like
to
make
the
case
for
Cork
in
term
of
the
servicing
of
offshore
renewable
energy
.
the
deepwater
port
of
the
low
harbour
would
be
a
excellent
key
national
reference
point
for
such
servicing
.
there
be
many
point
along
the
Atlantic
seaboard
that
would
be
appropriate
for
that
purpose
and
we
can
all
work
and
coalesce
with
each
other
on
that
agenda
.
we
be
very
conscious
that
the
EU
strategy
on
offshore
renewable
energy
have
key
target
and
there
be
a
massive
opportunity
in
that
.
we
know
we
will
need
27
GW
of
offshore
wind
to
meet
we
zero-
carbon
target
by
2050
.
put
that
into
perspective
,
Moneypoint
power
station
generate
approximately
850
mw
.
the
opportunity
be
there
in
term
of
offshore
generation
.
there
be
question
inherent
in
this
legislation
that
have
yet
to
be
answer
in
regard
to
the
offshore
opportunity
.
we
know
that
wind
will
provide
a
source
for
decarbonisation
.
we
know
it
must
come
from
float
offshore
wind
on
the
south
and
west
coast
because
traditional
fix
-
bottom
offshore
technology
be
only
for
shallow
water
such
as
that
of
the
Irish
Sea
,
which
give
limited
space
and
capacity
for
the
development
at
scale
that
be
need
.
we
must
start
now
by
ensure
that
float
wind
project
contribute
to
the
target
of
5
GW
of
offshore
wind
by
2030
.
starting
now
mean
we
can
begin
to
develop
the
supply
chain
,
include
at
port
such
as
Cork
,
in
order
that
float
wind
platform
can
be
deploy
from
Irish
port
up
to
and
beyond
the
2030
.
a
major
constraint
on
start
now
and
secure
the
benefit
of
float
wind
for
Ireland
stem
from
the
uncertainty
from
government
on
how
the
sector
will
be
progress
in
the
short
,
medium
and
long
term
.
the
forthcoming
climate
action
plan
should
have
a
target
for
float
wind
.
will
the
minister
tell
we
whether
this
have
be
address
?
how
will
he
ensure
the
legislation
cater
for
float
wind
development
?
in
order
for
float
wind
project
to
contribute
to
we
2030
target
,
developer
need
to
be
survey
at
sea
next
spring
or
summer
.
if
developer
have
to
wait
for
the
new
regulatory
authority
to
be
set
up
,
which
could
take
up
to
18
month
from
the
passing
of
the
Bill
,
they
could
miss
the
boat
.
how
will
the
minister
ensure
float
wind
developer
can
achieve
permission
to
survey
outside
of
the
12
nautical
mile
zone
in
2022
?
the
maritime
area
planning
legislation
be
a
major
reform
,
as
we
know
,
but
Ireland
have
be
sea
-
blind
for
too
many
decade
at
this
stage
.
that
be
evident
to
everyone
here
.
we
want
to
ensure
the
industry
can
scale
up
and
scale
out
.
that
permission
for
survey
need
to
be
give
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
should
be
address
within
this
legislation
.
we
be
call
on

provide
that
consent
in
advance
of
the
regulatory
authority
be
set
up
in
Wexford
.
I

this

,
like
many
sector
of

,
be
come
out
of
a
incredibly
difficult
time
follow
Covid
.
it
be
a
sector
that
certainly
step
up
during
the
crisis
,
which
both
Deputy
recognise
,
particularly
last
January
when
it
do
not
shut
but
continue
to
provide
early
learning
and
care
for
the
most
vulnerable
child
and
the

.
how
we
manage
to
deliver
that
be
through
the
employment
wage
subsidy
scheme
,
EWSS
,
and
the
sector
exemption
for
childcare
that
I
negotiate
with
the
Department

at

we

,
with
the

,
that

have
a

to
have
more

on

,
which
require
great

.
we
provide
that
through

all
the

I
have

have
recognise
how
important
that

be
up
to
this

they
also
recognise

there
will

in

that
the

will
be
taper
out

one

talk

a

must
give

like
she
a

in

sector
.
the
action
the
government
be
take
will
do
that
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
government
be
not
oppose
this
Bill
.
I
note
the
government
have
say
there
may
be
some
legal
issue
inherent
in
the
Bill
and
there
may
be
challenge
.
we
job
here
be
to
promulgate
legislation
and
work
through
it
.
if
issue
arise
in
the
court
thereafter
,
then
so
be
it
,
but
we
be
the
Legislature
.
I
wish
to
goodness
the
government
would
not
qualify
its
support
for
the
passage
of
a
Bill
by
come
out
with
language
such
as
that
.
it
be
a
culture
that
have
pervade
this
House
in
latter
year
.
we
should
proceed
on
a
issue
such
as
this
in
a
bipartisan
or
non-partisan
manner
and
seek
to
work
through
any
legal
issue
that
be
always
euphemistically
refer
to
.
we
strongly
support
give
rights
to
renter
.
that
be
what
this
be
about
,
fundamentally
.
we
be
all
inundate
with
call
from
constituent
who
find
themselves
in
challenging
position
,
include
that
live
in
substandard
,
Dickensian
residence
-
one
would
not
even
call
they
"
residence
"
-
and
people
who
be
try
to
get
on
the
first
rung
of
the
housing
ladder
.
we
be
make
a
honest
attempt
to
promulgate
legislation
which
would
seek
to
give
a
great
balance
to
the
renter
,
as
my
colleague
,
deputy
Bacik
,
say
.
it
remind
I
of
Michael
Davitt
and
the
Land
League
.
some
170
year
ago
,
Davitt
speak
of
fixity
of
tenure
and
fair
rent
.
when
it
come
to
renter
and
citizen
we
be
talk
about
the
same
principle
.
it
behove
we
all
to
try
to
legislate
effectively
so
that
we
shift
the
balance
and
there
be
a
paradigm
shift
away
from
the
market
and
towards
the
renter
,
allow
for
people
to
live
happily
and
affordably
in
they
own
home
if
they
be
not
owner
-
occupier
of
property
.
the
inspection
regime
by
local
authority
need
to
be
kick
-
start
again
.
I
understand
it
go
into
abeyance
during
lockdown
for
obvious
reason
but
there
be
people
in
receipt
of
the
housing
assistance
payment
,
hap
,
and
rental
accommodation
scheme
,
ras
,
payment
live
in
accommodation
support
by
the
State
that
be
completely
substandard
and
not
fit
for
anybody
to
live
in
.
that
inspection
regime
need
to
be
up
and
run
again

it
be

the
Library

Service

LRS

digest
have
be
very
useful
for
many
of
we
because
it
have
encapsulate
many
of
the
concern
that
have
be
bring
to
we
attention
.
as
member
will
know

it
have
issue
a
paper
in
response
to
the
Bill
.
certainly
,
many
issue
be
raise
in
respect
of
the
Bill
at
pre-legislative
scrutiny
,
PLS
,
stage
,
which
must
be
sufficiently
address
by
the
government
.
in
table
2
of
the
LRS
digest
,
it
have
supply
a
traffic
light
dashboard
compare
the
Bill
as
publish
to
the
committee
's
pls
recommendation
.
I
will
highlight
four
key
issue
inherent
in
the
Bill
and
quote
directly
from
the
report
.
the
first
issue
,
per
the
committee
report
,
be
:
Questionable
fairness
of
allocate
point
system
.
the
standard
of
proof
require
threshold
be
base
upon
balance
of
probability
rather
than
culpability
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
.
in
they
PLS
the
Joint
Committee
identify
the
potentially
problematic
nature
of
a
determination
panel
conclude
on
the
balance
of
probability
as
evidence
by
the
report
of
the
Authority
,
rather
than
a
threshold
for
proof
require
.
all
allege
serious
infringement
be
make
by
means
of
a
write
report
by
the
Authority
.
section
6
of
the
Bill
provide
that
a
determination
panel
will
be
establish
for
the
purpose
of
determine
whether
a
serious
infringement
have
occur
and
whether
a
person
be
,
at
the
time
,
the
master
of
the
sea
-
fishing
boat
.
in
address
a
appeal
process
,
a
appeal
officer
will
be
assign
at
the
Authority
.
a
time
period
of
30
day
be
available
in
which
to
submit
to
the
appeal
officer
.
the
appeal
must
be
in
writing
,
by
the
master
and
be
subject
to
a
fee
(
to
be
determine
)
.
the
issue
raise
by
the
committee
be
that
"
the
Bill
do
not
address
concern
regard
the
'
balance
of
probability
's
provide
the
require
threshold
of
proof
,
nor
how
exist
report
and
/
or
point
may
or
may
not
be
consider
in
the
Authority
's
assessment
of
further
allege
infringement
.
"
that
be
the
first
issue
.
the
second
issue
be
the
weighing
of
fishery
product
in
-
factory
.
the
committee
's
PLS
report
-
and
I
quote
again
from
the
digest
-
state
"
the
Bill
as
publish
do
not
cover
or
address
this
issue
.
"
the
third
issue
be
the
application
of
penalty
point
to
EU
and
non-EU
vessel
.
there
be
"
particular
concern
that
UK
vessel
in
Irish
water
be
advantaged
"
.
accord
to
the
digest
:
the
Bill
do
not
provide
for
assign
penalty
point
to
or
have
a
register
of
point
assign
to
foreign
national
.
instead
,
a
provision
in
section
6
(
15i
)
include
that
point
assign
to
a
foreign
master
will
be
notify
in
write
to
the
relevant
authority
of
the
relevant
Member
State
.
the
UK
be
not
specify
.
thus
the
Bill
do
not
provide
for
the
Authority
deal
with
serious
infringement
by
UK
fishing
master
in
Irish
territorial
water
in
the
same
way
as
provide
for
other
EU
Member
State
.
the
fourth
key
issue
be
fair
administration
and
Sea
Fishery
Protection
Authority
,
SFPA
,
capacity
and
resourcing
with
regard
to
the
register
of
penalty
point
.
at
the
prelegislative
scrutiny
stage
,
the
committee
state
that
the
Bill
do
not
have
provision
for
organisational
capacity
or
resourcing
for
the
SFPA
.
this
be
just
four
issue
.
I
have
quote
directly
from
the
Bill
digest
because
its
language
well
encapsulate
some
of
the
key
issue
exercising
community
throughout
the
country
.
I
hope
that
,
in
response
to
this
stage
of
the
Bill
,
the
minister
who
be
in
possession
might
further
articulate
how
this
very
pertinent
and
key
issue
be
to
be
deal
with
.
I
move
:
that
the
Bill
be
refer
to
the
select
Committee
on
justice
pursuant
to
standing
order
95
(
3
)
(

I
will
take
more
if
you
be
offer
,
a
lea
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
N73
.
the
N73
be
a
national
secondary
route
.
at
present
it
could
be
consider
no
more
than
a
local
road
in
term
of
how
it
have
be
treat
in
investment
term
.
the
route
will
take
you
from
west
of
Mallow
to
Rathmore
and
on
up
north
,
through
Mallow
and
on
into
Mitchelstown
.
there
be
a
part
of
the
road
,
from
Clogher
Cross
to
Waterdyke
or
,
as
we
know
it
locally
,
Canteen
Cross
,
and
also
at
Annakisha
South
where
,
up
to
now
,
for
this
year
alone
,
through
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
,
TII
,
€
1.5
million
have
be
spend
to
bring
the
process
to
tender
to
enable
work
to
be
carry
out
on
approximately
3
kilometer
of
road
.
I
be
give
to
understand
that
Cork
County
Council
and
TII
have
do
all
the
preparatory
work
on
this
.
all
we
be
ask
for
be
€
10
million
to
make
this
road
safe
.
it
be
currently
unsafe
.
when
heavy
goods
vehicle
pass
each
other
on
the
road
,
they
have
to
slow
down
to
a
stop
in
order
to
pass
because
there
be
no
verge
on
the
road
and
you
have
to
traverse
the
white
line
in
order
to
pass
at
certain
section
on
the
road
if
you
be
drive
a
heavy
goods
vehicle
.
the
road
be
a
important
road
because
it
be
a
national
secondary
road
.
I
can
not
emphasise
that
enough
.
it
have
be
devoid
and
starve
of
investment
for
decade
now
.
all
we
be
ask
be
that
the
government
not
take
the
foot
off
the
pedal
in
term
of
the
next
phase
of
the
project
.
we
be
fearful
that
if
there
be
any
reprofiling
of
road
spending
-
in
other
word
,
cutback
-
to
rob
Peter
to
pay
Paul
,
we
will
get
catch
in
the
cross
hair
in
north
Cork
,
between
Mallow
and
Mitchelstown
.
I
be
plead
with
the
government
not
to
take
this
off
the
agenda
and
to
allow
it
to
go
to
the
next
stage
.
in
the
context
of
overall
national
spend
on
road
,
€
10
million
be
but
a
drop
in
the
ocean
.
it
be
a
significant
amount
but
it
would
have
a
untold
benefit
for
people
travel
from
Kerry
to
Dublin
,
for
people
who
travel
from
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
and
vice
versa
and
,
in
particular
,
for
local
traffic
.
that
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
road
be
a
major
arterial
route
for
local
traffic
,
local
commerce
,
family
bring
child
to
school
and
people
who
travel
for
medical
reason
,
include
acute
medical
reason
,
for
care
in
Dublin
.
they
would
travel
from
Rathmore
on
through
Mallow
and
on
up
to
Dublin
.
there
be
a
part
of
the
road
I
have
just
mention
,
from
Clogher
Cross
to
Canteen
Cross
,
or
Waterdyke
,
that
have
to
be
do
.
I
be
implore
the
government
not
to
take
it
off
the
agenda
.
I
have
be
in
touch
with
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
and
Transport
,
Deputy
Michael
McGrath
and
Eamon
Ryan
,
and
I
have
have
engagement
with
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Transport
,
deputy
Hildegarde
Naughton
,
about
this
.
I
be
ask
that
it
stay
on
the
agenda
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
ask
she
to
use
she
good
office
and
positive
influence
to
bend
the
ear
of
the
minister
,
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
and
Michael
McGrath
,
and
perhaps
the
Taoiseach
,
whom
I
have
also
contact
about
this
issue
.
it
make
eminent
sense
to
progress
this
project
to
tender
now
.
if
TII
have
allocate
€
1.5
million
for
one
stretch
of
the
road
,
namely
,
Clogher
Cross
to
Canteen
Cross
,
and
€
300000
for
Annakisha
South
,
all
that
need
to
be
do
now
be
to
press
the
green
light
for
the
project
to
go
to
tender
and
get
the
job
do
.
the
road
will
then
be
right
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
,
except
normal
upkeep
and
maintenance
.
my
fear
,
however
,
be
that
the
project
will
slip
back
down
the
agenda
in
term
of
national
prioritisation
if
there
be
any
reprofiling
of
budget
for
road
in
the
estimate
process
.
I
be
raise
this
issue
at
a
critical
time
in
the
hope
that
every
minister
will
look
at
the
case
for
the
project
and
see
it
stack
up
to
make
the
investment
at
this
stage
rather
than
waste
the
money
that
have
be
spend
thus
far
by
not
progress
it
.
if
it
be
not
progress
now
,
it
will
not
be
progress
next
year
or
in
the
year
after
that
.
it
will
go
into
a
queue
,
we
will
be
wait
until
kingdom
come
for
the
work
to
be
do
and
the
investment
of
€
1.5
million
and
€
300000
will
be
for
nautht
.
we
should
spend
the
money
wisely
to
upgrade
the
road
now
,
for
the
reason
I
have
outline
.
the
RISM
metric
be
a
load
of
codswallop
.
I
appreciate
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
respond
on
behalf
of
another
minister
but
the
reality
be
that
this
be
a
unsafe
road
.
just
because
a
accident
or
collision
have
not
happen
do
not
mean
it
will
not
happen
.
the
problem
be
the
number
of
heavy
goods
vehicle
that
use
the
road
and
have
to
traverse
the
white
line
at
point
where
there
be
no
verge
.
there
be
no
margin
of
error
for
driver
,
which
be
why
they
have
to
slow
down
to
a
stop
.
I
thank
the
deputy
again
for
raise
this
issue
.
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
and
I
know
the
road
around
Galway
very
well
.
I
expect
there
be
many
people
who
use
the
N73
who
have
far
more
sway
than
I
in
advance
the
project
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
,
who
have
responsibility
for
this
matter
,
have
set
out
that
under
the
hd
15
network
safety
analysis
programme
,
safety
work
be
base
on
accident
density
across
the
network
.
that
section
of
the
network
with
considerably
high
than
average
accident
density
be
select
for
analyse
and
section
of
the
road
that
be
amenable
to
engineering
solution
be
prioritise
for
treatment
.
I
will
take
the
point
the
deputy
have
raise
this
evening
to
the
minister
.
it
be
clear
this
project
have
be
identify
in
previous
costing
around
planning
and
design
.
I
know
that
when
one
see
something
go
to
planning
and
design
,
the
funding
normally
follow
.
the
decision
be
not

to

I
will
ensure
it
be

I
welcome
this
motion
because
it
provide
a
timely
opportunity
to
discuss
the
issue
of
fuel
poverty
and
the
loom
energy
crisis
.
the
first
call
we
have
to
make
,
as
member
of
the
Oireachtas
and
representative
of
the
people
,
will
be
to
again
discuss
the
recently
announce
lift
of
the
moratorium
on
energy
disconnection
.
we
need
such
a
measure
to
ensure
that
people
be
not
cut
off
from
they
utility
supply
,
include
electricity
,
should
they
find
themselves
unable
to
pay
they
bill
over
the
come
winter
period
and
beyond
.
I
call
on
the
government
to
engage
with
the
commission
for
Regulation
of
utility
on
that
issue
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
the
regulator
at
least
discuss
the
possibility
of
put
that
moratorium
in
place
again
.
a
number
of
year
ago
,
I
visit
a
house
in
north
Cork
.
I
will
not
say
where
it
be
but
as
I
pull
up
to
the
gate
there
be
a
woman
lift
a
bag
of
timber
block
in
through
she
front
door
.
it
be
a
mid-terrace
house
and
she
be
lift
the
bag
in
through
she
front
door
.
naturally
,
we
would
all
assist
in
that
circumstance
and
I
do
so
.
she
and
I
get
to
talk
and
we
be
discuss
the
state
of
she
house
and
the
fact
that
she
be
pile
wood
into
a
fire
to
feed
a
back
boiler
to
heat
the
house
.
she
have
no
other
means
of
heat
the
house
and
she
spend
she
time
cling
to
she
fire
.
the
woman
be
in
the
same
situation
a
number
of
year
late
.
we
have
not
see
a
tangible
great
leap
forward
in
retrofit
programme
for
people
who
have
own
they
house
for
a
long
time
but
do
not
have
the
means
to
reinvest
in
they
because
there
be
a
shortfall
between
the
grant
available
and
the
true
cost
of
retrofit
.
if
that
cost
could
be
bridg
,
whether
for
people
live
in
a
local
authority
house
or
owner
-
occupier
,
it
would
greatly
assist
the
likes
of
that
woman
.
a
low
-
cost
loan
,
such
as
that
propose
by
the
government
,
will
not
be
sufficient
for
she
to
bridge
the
gap
.
her
savings
would
be
meagre
because
she
be
wholly
dependent
on
the
Department
of
social
Protection
for
she
means
of
income
.
there
have
to
be
a
good
way
of
ensure
that
the
thousand
of
people
in
similar
circumstance
be
give
a
opportunity
to
retrofit
they
house
in
a
way
that
provide
proper
heating
and
insulation
and
damp
-
proof
they
home
to
prevent
the
mould
on
wall
that
all
of
we
have
observe
in
house
we
have
visit
over
the
year
.
this
have
to
be
a
meaningful
objective
of
the
government
.
the
available
evidence
would
suggest
that
in
the
past
seven
or
eight
year
in
particular
,
we
have
not
have
that
great
leap
forward
or
deal
with
the
coterie
of
people
I
be
talk
about
,
of
whom
the
woman
I
describe
be
a
representative
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
acknowledge
that
.
if
something
be
do
for
that
woman
,
we
would
not
find
ourselves
argue
in
this
house
about
pre-budget
submission
that
seek
increase
payment
and
transfer
to
people
on
the
basis
that
they
have
to
meet
the
cost
of
continue
to
shove
wood
on
the
fire
to
feed
the
back
boiler
.
all
of
that
would
be
take
out
of
the
equation
.
be
that
as
it
may
,
we
be
at
a
juncture
where
measure
will
have
to
be
introduce
in
this
budget
to
offset
the
cost
of
the
increase
price
of
carbon
.
fuel
poverty
measure
must
be
in
evidence
in
the
budget
to
allow
that
woman
to
at
least
offset
the
cost
of
the
coal
,
briquette
and
block
that
she
be
force
to
burn
to
meet
she
need
.
that
issue
have
to
be
address
with
a
short
-
term
measure
.
budget
2022
must
introduce
a
carbon
tax
credit
as
a
offset
measure
to
deal
with
household
that
will
find
themselves
in
the
fuel
impoverish
category
in
the
come
12
month
and
beyond
.
if
the
increase
in
the
price
of
the
carbon
tax
be
already
price
in
follow
last
year
's
budget
,
the
danger
be
that
people
on
low
income
will
find
themselves
have
to
hunt
around
to
meet
the
cost
of
heat
they
home
.
if
a
refundable
tax
credit
be
introduce
for
this
people
,
it
would
be
a
meaningful
measure
that
would
at
least
offset
the
cost
of
the
increase
price
of
carbon
and
give
some
level
of
comfort
to
that
household
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
factor
that
suggestion
into
he
consideration
,
if
the
budget
have
not
already
be
put
to
bed
,
and
the
interplay
between
line
Department
and
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
at
this
late
hour
,
some
measure
that
would
give
work
family
and
fuel
impoverished
household
a
refundable
carbon
tax
credit
that
would
offset
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
energy
and
fuel
would
be
welcome
.
as
a
short
-
term
measure
,
the
Labour
Party
also
advocate
extend
the
fuel
allowance
by
four
week
.
this
measure
have
also
be
advocate
by
representative
organisation
,
particularly
that
represent
people
who
find
themselves
wholly
reliant
on
the
Department
of
social
Protection
for
a
payment
.
if
the
fuel
allowance
be
extend
by
four
week
or
increase
by
€
5
per
week
,
that
would
be
worth
approximately
€
272
to
recipient
.
that
would
help
the
woman
I
be
talk
about
.
President
Higgins
use
to
say
of
rural
electrification
that
it
take
the
stoop
out
of
the
back
of
the
woman
in
Ireland
because
they
be
not
bend
down
stoke
a
fire
all
they
life
to
keep
the
house
light
and
put
food
on
the
table
.
it
seem
that
thing
might
not
have
change
for
a
good
number
of
we
citizen
,
particularly
that
who
be
live
in
the
fuel
impoverished
house
we
be
talk
about
.
I
be
not
have
a
go
at
the
Minister
of
State
or
the

this
should
be
a
non-partisan
and
apolitical
issue
which
we
should

issue

of

fall
on

in

the

could
bring
into
play
some
simple
measure
,
include
the
carbon

that
would

a

I
thank
a
Cathaoirleach
Gníomhach
and
I
will
carry
out
a
rapid
-
fire
round
of
all
the
issue
I
can
speak
to
within
five
minute
.
it
be
a
awful
way
of
do
business
but
I
nonetheless
understand
it
.
my
first
issue
be
disability
,
to
continue
on
deputy
Tully
's
theme
and
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
be
present
.
I
welcome
the
allocation
of
€
13
million
of
additional
new
funding
for
residential
service
.
I
be
encounter
within
my
constituency
a
severe
shortage
of
residential
place
,
so
much
so
that
in
a
recent
parliamentary
question
date
11
October
,
I
receive
a
response
in
respect
of
a
person
who
be
look
for
a
full
-
time
residential
place
for
a
family
member
and
be
tell
:
"
unfortunately
,
the
number
of
people
require
residential
service
far
exceed
the
number
of
vacancy
within
the
service
.
"
I
welcome
the
additional
€
13
million
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
be
of
a
mind
to
do
so
,
I
would
ask
she
to
look
at
the
regional
residential
forum
to
see
how
that
be
operate
and
whether
there
need
to
be
more
work
do
or
a
great
light
shine
on
how
it
operate
,
which
would
be
welcome
.
with
regard
to
agriculture
,
€
49
million
be
to
be
the
ring
-
fence
for
agriculture
and
the
decarbonisation
effort
.
if
we
be
talk
about
a
just
transition
in
agriculture
and
if
we
be
to
include
farmer
in
that
just
transition
towards
decarbonisation
,
send
a
message
to
they
-
I
be
talk
about
small
farmer
,
not
big
rancher
-
that
the
government
be
take
€
40
million
away
from
they
and
give
it
to
the
Department
of
social
Protection
be
not
the
right
message
at
this
time
.
there
be
justifiable
anger
within
the
farming
community
.
they
understanding
be
that
this
be
to
be
ring
-
fence
within
the
carbon
tax
and
be
to
help
with
decarbonisation
measure
.
this
be
a
promise
that
be
make
within
the
programme
for
government
,
which
have
be
renege
upon
,
and
that
be
something
we
will
have
to
interrogate
further
as
time
go
on
.
if
the
government
be
to
bring
the
farming
community
with
it
on
this
decarbonisation
agenda
,
and
to
move
away
from
facile
statement
such
as
''
reduce
the
national
herd
''
,
this
issue
be
worthy
of
great
debate
as
it
be
a
great
deal
more
complex
than
that
.
the
move
to
take
€
49
million
from
the
farming
sector
to
assist
it
to
transition
and
decarbonise
be
ill
-
advise
and
be
something
that
should
be
revise
in
2022
,
if
possible
.
I
acknowledge
the
contribution
of
the
minister
,
deputy
O’Gorman
,
on
the
youth
travel
card
.
the
typical
fare
for
a
student
travel
from
Mallow
to
Cork
be
€
7
return
.
there
be
no
Leap
facility
on
this
route
.
I
will
be
talk
about
Mallow
to
Cork
and
Leap
service
until
the
cow
come
home
or
until
someone
eject
I
from
this
House
but
the
fare
will
be
half
price
at
€
3.50
through
the
youth
card
.
that
be
excellent
and
will
cost
€
1.75
single
.
that
be
a
competitive
fare
and
be
brilliant
for
somebody
in
the
undereducated
-
23
year
category
.
if
this
be
not
expand
or
if
Leap
service
be
not
put
in
place
on
route
which
be
typical
of
the
rest
of
the
country
outside
Dublin
,
we
have
a
problem
.
I
can
travel
from
Pearse
Station
Dublin
to
Greystone
on
a
Leap
card
but
I
cannot
travel
from
Mallow
to
Cork
on
this
card
.
the
youth
card
be
fine
and
it
send
a
wonderful
signal
to
young
people
that
the
price
be
come
down
,
which
I
welcome
,
but
for
people
who
want
to
get
out
of
they
car
and
get
on
to
commuter
train
,
it
do
nothing
.
I
be
make
the
case
again
in
the
short
time
that
I
have
for
the
expansion
of
the
Leap
service
to
provincial
rural
town
outside
of
the
Dublin
conurbation
and
to
start
think
beyond
the
Pale
.
if
the
government
can
get
people
out
of
they
car
and
on
to
train
and
public
transport
and
if
Leap
service
be
enable
,
more
people
will
use
they
.
there
be
a
latent
demand
there
for
this
.
I
welcome
the
youth
card
,
as
everybody
do
,
because
it
will
reduce
price
for
young
people
.
that
be
excellent
and
well
do
on
that
.
it
be
a
great
first
step
and
the
government
should
think
about
the
expansion
of
that
service
.
the
way
to
do
that
for
that
who
be
not
student
or
who
be
in
the
over
23
year
category
be
more
Leap
card
service
throughout
country
,
no
matter
where
people
live
.
this
be
about
equalisation
and
non-discrimination
on
the
basis
of
not
live
in
Dublin
.
this
be
not
,
incidentally
,
a
anti-dublin
rant
but
this
be
just
the
reality
for
most
people
on
the
ground
.
the
expenditure
report
on
road
safety
measure
mention
specific
road
.
the
N73
be
not
.
the
much
-
vaunted
m25
be
not
mention
.
be
that
even
in
the
national
development
plan
?
the
R264
be
also
not

I
welcome
much
of
yesterday
's
budget
and
commend
my
colleague
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
and
he
government
colleague
on
its
introduction
.
however
,
I
want
to
begin
by
make
a
general
point
about
the
entire
budgetary
process
.
it
be
date
,
irrelevant
to
people
's
daily
life
and
it
be
do
we
a
disservice
in
this
House
that
one
day
's
business
should
get
all
the
attention
and
drama
,
as
in
the
open
night
of
a
film
or
theatre
production
.
the
follow
-
on
and
impact
the
budget
have
on
people
's
daily
life
be
leave
for
non-elected
people
to
manage
and
proceed
,
and
there
be
little
accountability
.
that
be
why
we
have
hundred
of
thousand
of
people
on
waiting
list
,
such
as
the
young
boy
whose
situation
be
discuss
on
Claire
Byrne
's
radio
programme
yesterday
.
it
be
why
we
have
so
many
people
on
housing
waiting
list
and
people
who
will
not
see
the
benefit
of
the
€
80
billion
-
plus
spending
programme
that
be
announce
yesterday
.
this
be
the
15th
budget
I
have
address
as
a
member
of
the
House
.
it
have
always
strike
I
that
the
health
service
plan
be
a
really
good
example
of
the
lack
of
accountability
in
the
budgetary
process
.
the
plan
will
dictate
and
operationalise
the
expenditure
of
some
€
22
billion
,
yet
it
will
probably
be
publish
,
go
on
previous
year
,
in
the
couple
of
day
before
the
Christmas
recess
,
when
nobody
will
give
it
any
attention
.
there
will
not
be
24
-
7
media
coverage
of
its
content
,
live
television
interview
with
minister
or
discussion
for
hour
on
end
of
what
be
contain
in
it
.
however
,
that
document
set
out
how
the
money
the
House
be
approve
will
be
spend
and
the
way
in
which
it
will
make
a
difference
.
when
it
come
to
the
health
service
plan
,
the
oversight
be
aprè
the
fact
.
the
chairman
of
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
,
deputy
Stanley
,
will
get
to
see
it
and
examine
the
expenditure
arise
from
it
next
year
,
as
will
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
even
if
there
be
issue
with
how
the
money
be
spend
,
nobody
be
ever
hold
to
account
.
in
fact
,
the
only
people
who
be
hold
to
account
be
that
on
waiting
list
and
that
whose
life
's
journey
be
make
much
more
complicated
by
a
system
that
do
not
seem
to
work
for
people
and
have
they
need
at
its
heart
.
we
can
do
a
Punch
and
Judy
act
in
this
chamber
throw
argument
over
and
back
,
but
the
reality
be
that
we
have
a
major
problem
with
we
delivery
mechanism
in
this
country
.
the
people
who
be
lose
out
because
of
that
be
the
people
we
serve
.
yes
,
we
have
a
oversight
role
and
we
need
to
be
strong
in
how
we
do
it
,
but
the
more
time
I
spend
here
,
the
more
I
see
that
we
need
to
reform
the
budget
process
entirely
.
it
be
unfair
on
people
whose
daily
income
depend
on
State
support
and
who
must
wait
for
this
day
every
year
to
know
what
they
will
have
to
spend
in
the
come
12
month
.
we
need
to
get
to
multi-annual
budgeting
for
people
who
depend
on
social
welfare
payment
.
we
need
multi-annual
budgeting
in
order
for
Department
to
know
what
they
have
to
spend
.
this
nonsense
of
have
to
spend
allocate
money
quickly
in
the
few
month
before
the
end
of
each
year
,
a
situation
which
allow
all
sort
of
issue
around
accountability
to
arise
,
need
to
stop
.
the
Committee
on
Budgetary
Oversight
,
chair
by
deputy
Hourigan
,
do
wonderful
work
but
we
need
to
look
at
the
entire
budgetary
process
and
ask
ourselves
whether
it
be
the
proper
way
to
do
business
in
the
21st
century
.
there
be
a
number
of
key
issue
arise
from
yesterday
's
budget
.
many
of
the
benefit
it
make
provision
for
be
welcome
,
particularly
in
a
context
where
they
be
the
first
major
tax
cut
and
substantial
12
-
month
and
52
-
week
welfare
increase
for
many
year
.
however
,
the
government
will
have
to
be
hyper
-
vigilant
when
it
come
to
inflation
and
ensure
there
be
no
price
gouging
go
on
within
a
already
difficult
market
across
many
area
.
the
cost
of
fuel
,
food
and
input
for
construction
,
agriculture
and
many
other
sector
be
already
rise
fast
than
people
's
income
.
we
must
make
sure
there
be
no
profiteering
.
I
would
like
to
see
extra
resource
for
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
to
ensure
it
be
visible
and
active
in
monitor
price
,
particularly
in
the
fuel
and
food
sector
,
so
that
people
have
a
assurance
that
this
issue
be
be
watch
and
manage
.

I

have
listen
over

to
the

from

I
be
remind

with

let

let

there
be

even
though
the

the

we
have

the

be

there
be
criticism
today
that

that

it

go

in

however
,
that

set

it

even
if
there
be

with
how
the

be

nobody
be
ever
hold

in
fact
,
the
only
people
who
be
hold

be
that
on

that
whose
life
's

be
make
much
more
complicated
by
a

that
do
not
seem
to
work

have
they

we
can
do
a
Punch
and
Judy
act
in
this
chamber
throw
argument
over

back
,
but
the
reality
be
that
we
have
a
major

with

delivery
mechanism
in

the

yes

we

money
be
spend
,
nobody
be
ever
hold
to
account
.
in
fact
,
the
only
people
who
be
hold
to
account
be
that
on
waiting
list
and
that
whose
life
's
journey
be
make
much
more
complicated
by
a
system
that
do
not
seem
to
work
for
people
and
have
they
need
at
its
heart
.
we
can
do
a
Punch
and
Judy
act
in
this
chamber
throw
argument
over
and
back
,
but
the
reality
be
that
we
have
a
major
problem
with
we
delivery
mechanism
in
this
country
.
the
people
who
be
lose
out
because
of
that
be
the
people
we
serve
.
yes
,
we
have
a
oversight
role
and
we
need
to
be
strong
in
how
we
do
it
,
but
the
more
time
I
spend
here
,
the
more
I
see
that
we
need
to
reform
the
budget
process
entirely
.
it
be
unfair
on
people
whose
daily
income
depend
on
State
support
and
who
must
wait
for
this
day
every
year
to
know
what
they
will
have
to
spend
in
the
come
12
month
.
we
need
to
get
to
multi-annual
budgeting
for
people
who
depend
on
social
welfare
payment
.
we
need
multi-annual
budgeting
in
order
for
Department
to
know
what
they
have
to
spend
.
this
nonsense
of
have
to
spend
allocate
money
quickly
in
the
few
month
before
the
end
of
each
year
,
a
situation
which
allow
all
sort
of
issue
around
accountability
to
arise
,
need
to
stop
.
the
Committee
on
Budgetary
Oversight
,
chair
by
deputy
Hourigan
,
do
wonderful
work
but
we
need
to
look
at
the
entire
budgetary
process
and
ask
ourselves
whether
it
be
the
proper
way
to
do
business
in
the
21st
century
.
there
be
a
number
of
key
issue
arise
from
yesterday
's
budget
.
many
of
the
benefit
it
make
provision
for
be
welcome
,
particularly
in
a
context
where
they
be
the
first
major
tax
cut
and
substantial
12
-
month
and
52
-
week
welfare
increase
for
many
year
.
however
,
the
government
will
have
to
be
hyper
-
vigilant
when
it
come
to
inflation
and
ensure
there
be
no
price
gouging
go
on
within
a
already
difficult
market
across
many
area
.
the
cost
of
fuel
,
food
and
input
for
construction
,
agriculture
and
many
other
sector
be
already
rise
fast
than
people
's
income
.
we
must
make
sure
there
be
no
profiteering
.
I
would
like
to
see
extra
resource
for
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
to
ensure
it
be
visible
and
active
in
monitor
price
,
particularly
in
the
fuel
and
food
sector
,
so
that
people
have
a
assurance
that
this
issue
be
be
watch
and
manage
.

it

very

we

to

continue
.
I
be
not
normally
into
opposition
bashing
but
have
listen
over
the
past
24
hour
to
the
different
response
from
various
speaker
,
I
be
remind
of
a
feis
year
ago
where
people
would
come
in
with
a
script
they
would
recite
each
time
,
but
with
different
intonation
depend
on
what
they
be
teach
to
emphasise
or
stress
,
to
try
to
impress
the
adjudicator
.
it
seem
like
many
of
the
script
that
have
be
deliver
in
the
House
be
write
week
ago
,
possibly
while
deputy
be
on
they
summer
holiday
,
because
they
do
not
reflect
what
be
in
the
budget
.
let
we
have
a
honest
debate
about
what
be
in
each
budget
document
.
let
we
get
that
document
independently
cost
before
the
budget
be
publish
in
order
that
we
can
have
a
honest
debate
.
let
we
ensure
each
budget
document
be
lay
out
along
the
same
parameter
,
as
oppose
to
have
goalpost
that
shift
more
often
than
Opposition
Member
's
position
,
depend
on
what
be
be
say
on
Twitter
at
any
give
time
.
some
speaker
be
here
today
criticise
the
fact
that
pensioner
be
only
get
a
extra
fiver
,
despite
the
fact
that
this
be
the
figure
indicate
in
they
own
party
's
policy
budget
document
.
there
be
much
criticism
of
the
fuel
allowance
provision
,
even
though
the
increase
certain
party
propose
be
way
below
what
have
be
guarantee
by
the
government
.
the
fuel
allowance
increase
kick
in
from
yesterday
evening
and
will
be
back
-
pay
in
a
few
week
's
time
.
I
wish
the
exemption
change
be
great
,
because
the
allowance
be
still
not
be
pay
to
all
the
people
who
need
it
,
but
we
have
make
a
start
.
the
living
alone
allowance
be
very
important
for
people
.
there
be
criticism
today
that
the
increase
be
only
€
3
,
but
that
€
3
come
on
top
of
a
additional
€
5
last
year
,
which
amount
to
a
increase
of
€
8
in
the
past
12
month
.
every
cent
of
that
money
will
be
spend
on
local
service
and
in
local
shop
.
that
type
of
support
be
really
important
to
people
,
which
be
why
it
be
essential
that
the
government
be
hyper
-
vigilant
on
inflation
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
local
improvement
scheme
,
LIS
.
it
be
a
valuable
scheme
and
one
that
have
benefit
many
rural
dweller
.
we
perception
be
that
a
significant
proportion
of
the
2021
allocation
go
to
the
Cavan
and
Monaghan
region
.
Cork
be
the
big
county
and
the
native
county
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Joe
O'Brien
,
and
it
could
argue
by
any
objective
analysis
that
it
do
not
receive
a
proportionate
and
fair
share
of
that
allocation
.
the
metric
will
clearly
show
that
,
in
the
second
round
,
Cavan
and
Monaghan
do
extremely
well
.
I
take
the
point
that
the
minister
be
make
in
respect
of
the
second
tranche
and
the
notification
to
individual
local
authority
,
but
I
would
argue
that
,
by
any
reasonable
analysis
,
the
lead
-
in
time
in
July
and
the
deadline
for
receipt
be
very
short
.
Cork
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
be
the
large
county
with
the
most
road
.
the
Minister
of
State
sit
beside
the
minister
will
attest
to
that
fact
.
come
out
of
the
second
allocation
,
there
be
not
a
proportionate
allocation
across
the
board
.
Cork
could
tee
up
approximately
€
2
million
in
LIS
project
,
which
would
take
a
savage
amount
of
a
allocation
out
of
the
LIS
.
Cork
,
with
the
reasonable
people
that
there
be
in
the
local
authority
,
put
in
project
-----
-----
for
which
there
be
a
return
for
a
minimal
investment
.
all
I
be
ask
for
in
2022
be
equity
across
the
board
for
every
county
.
we
will
have
to
carry
this
conversation
on
outside
.
all
I
be
ask
be
that
account
be
take
of
the
size
of
county
like
Galway
and
Cork
.
they
be
big
county
with
a
large
number
of
road
,
for
which
there
be
the
potential
to
deliver
more
through
the
LIS
.
the
whole
nature
of
the
LIS
be
to
service
road
that
be
unserviced
by
local
authority
.
we
have
a
lot
more
of
that
in
Cork
than
most
other
county
.
I
acknowledge
what
the
minister
be
say
in
respect
of
Limerick
and
she
own
part
of
the
world
,
but
there
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
or
a
long
lead
-
in
time
to
allow
local
authority
to
respond
with
project
.
that
be
all
I
be
ask
for
in
2022
.
I
support
my
colleague
on
this
issue
and
I
will
give
a
minor
perspective
on
it
.
when
this
organisation
be
apply
for
funding
,
the
funding
come
in
from
local
authority
be
sometimes
perceive
to
be
ad
hoc
and
may
not
be
transformative
in
term
of
what
they
want
to
do
,
even
though
they
be
look
for
modest
amount
.
if
there
be
a
core
funding
line
come
from
the
Department
,
I
would
certainly
join
with
my
colleague
in
support
it
.
in
the
round
,
I
be
try
to
glean
from
the
minister
a
perspective
on
the
next
common
agricultural
Policy
,
CAP
,
and
how
Pillar
ii
fall
in
respect
of
leader
funding
and
the
co-funding
.
it
would
be
useful
to
know
what
percentage
be
in
the
mind
of
the
minister
for
co-funding
on
Pillar
ii
element
.
we
be
hear
80
%
or
90
%
.
perhaps
the
minister
could
give
we
some
view
on
that
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
she
response
.
we
acknowledge
the
additional
€
70
million
that
have
be
provide
but
we
be
start
from
a
pretty
low
base
.
the
€200
million
allocate
for
2016
to
2020
be
way
down
on
the
€400
million
that
have
be
allocate
historically
.
we
be
hopeful
that
the
minister
will
be
successful
in
claw
back
that
money
and
increase
the
amount
necessary
to
provide
for
Pillar
ii
.
have
there
be
bilateral
engagement
at
between
both
Department
at
ministerial
level
?
my
second
question
be
more
of
a
point
.
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
be
say
that
this
be
farmer
's
money
.
there
be
some
of
we
who
would
argue
that
while
it
be
farmer
's
money
,
it
be
also
money
that
should
go
to
rural
Ireland
and
there
need
to
be
a
certain
countering
of
that
narrative
.
I
would
like
to
get
the
minister
's
perspective
on
that
as
well
.
in
try
to
get
people
to
live
in
town
centre
,
I
would
like
the
minister
to
consider
the
issue
of
application
before
a
local
authority
for
conversion
of
a
premise
in
town
that
be
Edwardian
or
Georgian
in
they
architectural
character
.
applicant
find
they
meet
massive
impediment
when
deal
with
the
local
authority
planning
department
.
I
ask
that
some
leeway
be
give
to
take
into
account
the
historical
nature
of
that
building
.
it
be
not
always
easy
to
apply
a
21st
century
model
of
architecture
to
a
18th
or
19th
century
building
.
I
ask
the
minister
allow
for
some
leeway
or
headroom
to
be
give
to
the
applicant
such
that
they
can
make
the
conversion
without
it
be
overly
onerous
,
while
also
meet
the
fire
safety
and
other
standard
one
would
expect
for
any
application
.
I
engage
with
the
minister
previously
on
CAP
and
its
effect
on
leader
funding
.
she
acknowledge
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
deputy
McConalogue
,
be
go
around
the
country
do
he
roadshow
at
present
.
I
wonder
if
the
minister
be
of
a
mind
to
do
a
similar
type
of
roadshow
.
certainly
,
we
want
to
ensure
that
what
will
be
secure
inside
the
farm
gate
will
be
the
good
possible
outcome
for
farmer
,
but
also
what
will
be
secure
outside
the
farm
gate
for
rural
dweller
and
people
live
in
rural
Ireland
be
similarly
important
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
I
welcome
she
specific
reference
to
the
Irish
local
Development
Network
.
the
ILDN
have
outline
,
through
its
future
leader
working
group
,
a
document
which
,
to
my
mind
,
represent
a
good
direction
of
travel
.
if
there
be
to
be
great
traction
on
that
document
in
term
of
what
the
ILDN
can
deliver
for
rural
Ireland
,
that
would
be
a
good
way
forward
.
the
condition
the
deputy
have
describe
be
unacceptable
.
when
the
issue
be
raise
in
relation
to
Oliver
bond
House
by
deputy
Bríd
Smith
,
I
have
direct
contact
with
the
resident
association
there
.
it
have
be
very
active
in
Oliver
bond
House
and
I
give
it
great
credit
for
that
.
that
approach
from
a
resident
association
be
good
but
we
have
to
make
inroad
in
resolve
this
issue
.
to
that
end
,
the
Department
have
give
careful
consideration
to
the
finding
of
the
European

the
select
Committee
on
foreign
affair
and
Defence
discuss
this
issue
last
week
,
as
we
have
previously
hear
,
and
my
colleague
,
deputy
Stanton
,
raise
significant
issue
at
that
committee
.
my
understanding
be
that
there
be
no
significant
objection
to
the
agreement
but
a
number
of
issue
be
raise
.
for
a
small
country
like
Ireland
that
have
focus
on
grow
we
trade
around
the
world
,
a
agreement
like
this
offer
many
opportunity
.
we
trade
with
the
Association
of
South
East
Asian
Nation
,
Asean
,
region
amount
to
more
than
€
10
billion
in
2019
.
it
be
also
essential
that
the
EU
maintain
a
strong
relationship
with
country
in
the
Pacific
region
as
China
aggressively
expand
its
influence
.
that
be
why
the
EU
recently
publish
its
Indo
-
Pacific
strategy
on
how
it
will
engage
with
the
region
.
however
,
this
statement
on
the
agreement
also
offer
we
a
chance
to
be
very
clear
about
we
value
and
what
we
stand
for
as
a
trading
bloc
.
in
many
way
,
Singapore
be
a
major
competitor
of
Ireland
's
,
as
it
have
also
position
itself
as
a
hub
for
global
trade
and
commerce
.
however
,
we
have
concern
about
human
rights
and
the
protection
available
in
Singapore
.
the
foreign
Interference
(
Countermeasures
)
act
2021
that
be
pass
just
two
week
ago
be
deeply
concerning
because
it
target
so
-
call
"
foreign
influence
"
and
many
think
it
will
be
use
to
stifle
dissent
.
it
give
the
home
affair
minister
the
power
to
investigate
individual
suspect
of
be
foreign
agent
engage
in
"
hostile
information
campaign
"
.
a
independent
panel
chair
by
a
judge
will
consider
appeal
against
the
minister
's
finding
,
although
person
mark
as
"
politically
significant
"
will
not
be
allow
to
file
such
appeal
.
what
do
"
politically
significant
"
mean
?
be
it
someone
campaign
against
the
law
and
rule
of
Singapore
,
for
example
?
authority
will
also
be
allow
to
compel
social
media
platform
and
website
operator
to
hand
over
user
datum
without
any
justification
in
select
instance
.
in
2019
,
it
also
pass
a
law
give
authority
the
power
to
police
online
platform
and
even
private
chat
group
.
this
do
not
sound
in
line
with
EU
value
.
the
foreign
Interference
(
Countermeasures
)
act
,
FICA
,
be
a
deeply
chill
law
that
will
impact
on
freedom
of
expression
,
association
and
privacy
and
we
should
be
very
concerned
about
its
implication
,
especially
for
that
campaign
to
strengthen
human
rights
.
Eleven
organisation
,
include
Amnesty
International
and
human
Right
watch
,
have
call
on
Singapore
to
withdraw
the
law
because
it
contravene
international
legal
and
human
rights
principle
.
the
treatment
of
migrant
labour
in
Singapore
be
also
a
area
of
major
concern
.
the
rights
of
worker
and
the
condition
they
have
to
work
under
in
a
tropical
climate
be
deeply
concerning
.
as
for
the
retention
of
capital
punishment
,
include
the
death
penalty
and
public
flog
,
four
people
be
execute
in
2019
,
include
two
for
drug
-
related
offence
.
there
be
a
mandatory
death
sentence
for
import
or
export
certain
quantity
of
drug
.
another
major
concern
be
about
LGBTI
rights
in
Singapore
.
the
Minister
of
State
might
make
clear
to
the
House
how
we
intend
to
ensure
that
we
defend
and
promote
the
rights
of
member
of
the
LGBTI
community
,
a
area
in
which
Ireland
have
be
a
world
leader
,
and
how
they
will
be
protect
and
enhance
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
also
be
aware
that
in
February
2019
,
the
European
Parliament
adopt
a
resolution
on
this
agreement
call
for
LGBTI
rights
in
Singapore
through
the
free
trade
deal
.
the
European
Parliament
condemn
the
lack
of
such
rights
and
protection
and
call
for
the
abolition
of
law
penalise
same
-
sex
relationship
and
for
full
protection
of
LGBTI
and
woman
's
rights
through
anti-discrimination
legislation
.
it
be
important
also
to
note
that
Singapore
retain
a
colonial
-
era
law
from
the
1930s
.
section
377a
of
the
Penal
code
continue
to
criminalise
sex
between
man
.
the
question
for
Ireland
must
be
how
we
leverage
we
trade
relationship
and
position
within
the
EU
to
influence
and
change
this
.
pass
this
agreement
despite
all
this
human
rights
issue
be
deeply
problematic
.
that
be
why
before
we
in
the
Labour
Party
can
agree
to
support
this
motion
,
therefore
,
we
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
outline
what
Ireland
and
the
EU
will
do
about
this
deeply
concern
matter
.
that
be
deeply
patronising
.
it
be
the
most
condescending
statement
to
make
towards
fellow
member
.
we
speak
with
some
level
of
authority
and
proof
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
clarify
that
.
there
be
a
interesting
article
in
the
Irish
Times
by
Conor
Lally
.
it
state
:
Gardaí
have
identify
over
50
young
people
in
and
around
one
Co.
Kerry
town
who
be
recruit
as
money
mule
for
a
international
crime
syndicate
.
the
Irish
Times
understand
a
young
man
from
Munster
be
believe
to
be
work
for
the
crime
gang
as
a
recruiter
and
he
reach
into
the
local
population
,
especially
among
student
,
have
prove
significant
.
the
recruiter
,
himself
a
Irish
teenager
,
appear
to
have
be
very
successful
at
convince
he
peer
to
allow
they
bank
account
be
use
to
receive
money
from
the
fraud
carry
out
by
the
gang
.
Garda
source
say
they
be
very
concerned
such
a
large
number
of
young
people
in
a
relatively
sparsely
populate
part
of
the
Republic
be
so
willing
to
allow
they
account
to
be
use
.
I
raise
this
article
in
the
context
of
this
debate
because
one
of
the
element
of
this
be
the
creation
of
a
bank
account
register
,
as
I
understand
it
,
and
that
register
will
provide
information
through
a
single
access
point
,
include
name
,
iban
,
date
of
account
opening
and
closing
,
duration
of
the
lease
period
in
the
case
of
safety
deposit
box
and
so
on
.
the
Kerry
case
be
relevant
to
this
.
I
do
not
want
to
sound
like
Pollyanna
but
the
fear
I
have
concern
young
people
,
in
particular
.
we
have
all
make
mistake
when
we
be
young
.
we
be
foolish
and
do
stupid
thing
.
person
who
make
mistake
will
be
subject
to
the
rigour
of
the
law
.
of
that
there
can
be
no
question
or
doubt
.
however
,
I
be
fearful
that
mistake
people
make
when
they
be
young
could
follow
they
throughout
life
.
how
will
this
new
database
impact
on
that
young
people
,
for
instance
?
will
they
account
and
name
be
permanently
list
on
the
database
?
there
be
always
a
imbalance
between
the
crime
lord
and
the
mule
.
the
mule
be
always
the
first
to
be
subject
to
the
rigour
of
the
law
and
the
crime
lord
walk
off
into
the
sunset
or
Marbella
or
wherever
they
happen
to
be
.
I
be
concerned
that
there
will
be
a
disproportionately
negative
impact
on
people
who
find
themselves
in
the
position
where
they
account
have
be
use
.
if
a
crime
have
be
commit
,
they
be
subject
to
the
rigour
of
the
law
but
,
once
that
be
do
,
if
it
be
do
in
this
case
,
I
hope
this
do
not
follow
they
for
the
rest
of
they
life
.
it
be
a
issue
that
arise
in
the
last
24
hour
.
I
be
hopeful
there
will
be
some
clarity
around
how
that
case
in
Kerry
would
be
impact
.
it
concern
teenager
who
may
or
may
not
have
do
something
stupidly
or
in
ignorance
.
some
will
know
quite
well
what
they
be
up
to
and
know
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
but
there
be
always
people
who
will
be
lead
on
and
naive
.
I
be
fearful
they
could
be
forever
blacklist
in
any
financial
transaction
they
have
.
if
they
go
on
to
lead
good
,
decent
and
proper
life
and
hold
account
,
I
hope
this
do
not
follow
they
and
they
be
not
blacklist
by
financial
institution
or
statutory
agency
.
I
hope
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
will
provide
some
clarity
on
the
simple
question
I
have
ask
.
I
welcome
the
short
debate
on
this
important
matter
,
which
have
afford
the
House
the
opportunity
to
mark
the
month
in
which
pregnancy
and
Infant
loss
Remembrance
Day
occur
.
we
know
that
300
to
350
family
be
affect
by
stillbirth
annually
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
be
also
conscious
of
that
parent
who
register
stillbirth
on
the
understanding
that
the
record
will
not
be
open
to
public
access
.
some
formulation
should
be
find
to
accommodate
they
need
and
wish
.
as
I
say
,
the
minister
of
the
day
set
two
aim
for
the
relevant
legislation
when
it
be
introduce
in
1994
.
the
first
be
to
recognise
the
therapeutic
effect
that
registration
might
deliver
for
grieve
parent
.
the
second
be
to
create
a
permanent
record
akin
to
the
register
of
birth
within
the
civil
registration
system
.
the
challenge
be
to
ensure
this
two
aim
be
be
address
in
the
current
manner
in
which
registration
be
complete
and
record
access
.
as
the
legislation
stand
,
access
be
very
restrictive
and
somewhat
out
of
line
with
the
access
allow
for
other
form
of
registration
where
sensitivity
be
also
engage
.
the
minister
be
commit
to
engage
with
parent
and
interested
party
to
see
whether
a
good
formulation
can
be
find
to
address
they
concern
while
also
alig
the
operation
of
the
stillbirth
register
with
other
register
maintain
by
the
GRO
.
I
will
take
the
point
the
deputy
make
about
access
to
maternity
leave
and
benefit
to
the
minister
.
I

this
two
aim
be
be
address
in
the
current
manner
in
which
registration
be
complete
and
record
access
.
as
the
legislation
stand
,
access
be
very
restrictive
and
somewhat
out
of
line
with
the
access
allow
for
other
form
of
registration
where
sensitivity
be
also
engage
.
the
minister
be
commit
to
engage
with
parent
and
interested
party
to
see
whether
a
good
formulation
can
be
find
to
address
they
concern
while
also
alig
the
operation
of
the
stillbirth
register
with
other
register
maintain
by
the
GRO
.
I
will
take
the
point
the
deputy
make
about
access
to
maternity
leave
and
benefit
to
the
minister
.
I
thank
she
for
the
opportunity
to
address
this
topic
.
I
welcome
the
short
debate
on
this
important
matter
,
which
have
afford
the
House
the
opportunity
to
mark
the
month
in
which
pregnancy
and
Infant
loss
Remembrance
Day
occur
.
we
know
that
300
to
350
family
be
affect
by
stillbirth
annually
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
be
also
conscious
of
that
parent
who
register
stillbirth
on
the
understanding
that
the
record
will
not
be
open
to
public
access
.
some
formulation
should
be
find
to
accommodate
they
need
and
wish
.
as
I
say
,
the
minister
of
the
day
set
two
aim
for
the
relevant
legislation
when
it
be
introduce
in
1994
.
the
first
be
to
recognise
the
therapeutic
effect
that
registration
might
deliver
for
grieve
parent
.
the
second
be
to
create
a
permanent
record
akin
to
the
register
of
birth
within
the
civil
registration
system
.
the
challenge
be
to
ensure
this
two
aim
be
be
address
in
the
current
manner
in
which
registration
be
complete
and
record
access
.
as
the
legislation
stand
,
access
be
very
restrictive
and
somewhat
out
of
line
with
the
access
allow
for
other
form
of
registration
where
sensitivity
be
also
engage
.
the
minister
be
commit
to
engage
with
parent
and
interested
party
to
see
whether
a
good
formulation
can
be
find
to
address
they
concern
while
also
alig
the
operation
of
the
stillbirth
register
with
other
register
maintain
by
the
GRO
.
I
will
take
the
point
the
deputy
make
about
access
to
maternity
leave
and
benefit
to
the
minister
.
I
thank
she
for
the
opportunity
to
address
this
topic
.
that
be
agree
,
a
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
speak
to
this
issue
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
Bill
.
we
be
,
however
,
up
to
we
oxter
in
legislation
on
this
issue
,
and
I
be
not
necessarily
convinced
that
more
legislation
be
the
way
forward
,
but
we
support
the
principle
of
the
Bill
.
there
be
no
question
about
that
.
we
have
to
interrogate
the
number
more
forcefully
.
I
do
not
doubt
-
I
have
never
doubt
-
the
bona
fide
of
the
Minister
of
State
and
what
she
be
seek
to
achieve
.
the
issue
be
one
of
resource
and
the
lack
thereof
.
I
have
sympathy
with
any
line
minister
who
have
to
go
up
against
a
minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
in
a
budgetary
process
to
fight
for
resource
,
particularly
resource
for
child
.
we
in
this
house
seem
to
have
fail
miserably
,
collectively
and
historically
,
when
it
come
to
child
and
they
need
because
there
be
this
antiquated
process
whereby
the
line
minister
of
the
day
,
through
a
budgetary
process
,
have
to
fight
on
he
or
she
back
for
service
that
should
self
-
evidently
be
make
available
.
we
all
come
in
here
and
speak
about
the
need
of
child
and
where
society
should
deliver
for
child
,
but
the
evidence
show
that
that
be
not
happen
in
reality
.
I
be
constantly
tab
parliamentary
question
about
the
assessment
of
need
process
and
the
child
's
disability
network
team
process
.
on
21
September
2021
I
receive
a
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
-
Parliamentary
question
no.
1213
of
9
September
2021
-
in
which
I
have
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
-
for
health
,
I
stress
-
the
number
of
child
see
across
all
area
of
intervention
in
each
community
healthcare
organisation
,
CHO
,
area
since
the
commencement
of
the
progress
disability
service
policy
on
19
April
2021
and
the
number
await
a
assessment
in
each
of
that
cho
since
the
advent
of
the
policy
and
the
child
's
disability
network
team
policy
.
in
CHO
4
there
be
997
child
still
await
a
assessment
.
that
be
incontrovertible
proof
that
the
system
have
not
bedd
down
and
there
be
more
work
to
be
do
.
this
be
the
figure
produce
by
the
HSE
.
the
total
number
of
overdue
application
be
997
.
the
number
of
overdue
application
with
exceptional
circumstance
be
238
.
the
number
of
overdue
application
without
exceptional
circumstance
be
759
.
we
do
not
even
know
if
this
be
real
-
time
figure
because
the
HSE
have
say
that
the
information
that
can
be
provide
be
for
the
end
of
quarter
2
of
2021
and
that
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
activity
in
that
period
may
have
be
impact
by
the
recent
cyberattack
on
the
HSE
.
as
I
understand
it
,
application
be
deem
overdue
if
it
have
be
over
six
month
since
the
application
be
accept
by
the
HSE
and
there
be
no
record
of
a
assessment
report
be
send
to
the
liaison
officer
or
the
applicant
.
I
say
respectfully
to
the
Minister
of
State
that
we
still
have
a
problem
in
CHO
4
,
that
be
,
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
.
we
still
have
a
problem
in
Kildare
,
Dublin
and
west
Wicklow
.
there
be
936
child
await
initial
assessment
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
use
she
good
office
and
to
use
the
weight
of
she
office
to
lean
on
the
HSE
to
extract
from
it
commitment
that
that
number
will
come
down
rapidly
and
that
that
child
's
rights
will
be
meet
under
the
Disability
Act
2005
,
which
be
subsequently
the
subject
of
high
court
proceedings
.
I
want
to
raise
that
specifically
because
it
be
pertinent
to
this
debate
.
as
for
Cork
and
Kerry
community
healthcare
organisation
,
there
be
,
as
I
understand
it
,
14
team
,
11
in
Cork
and
three
in
Kerry
.
however
,
again
through
a
parliamentary
question
I
tab
,
I
find
that
4611
child
be
transfer
to
the
various
team
around
Cork
in
April
but
that
only
1694
of
they
have
have
they
initial
contact
with
they
team
since
then
.
we
all
want
to
give
the
policy
of
the
child
's
disability
network
team
,
cDNT
-
we
be
so
full
of
acronym
now
-
a
fair
wind
,
but
the
measure
of
success
will
be
in
the
number
and
the
metric
.
if
we
see
relatively
low
number
,
we
will
know
it
be
work
and
at
least
parent
and
child
will
have
have
that
contact
with
that
cDNT
.
however
,
I
have
evidence
in
a
email
here
that
I
receive
from
one
family
just
last
week
.
it
state
:
I
be
sorry
for
the
wait
in
assess
service
,
but
it
be
take
we
long
than
expect
to
meet
the
child
on
we
caseload
due
to
much
-
long
-
than
-
expect
transfer
number
.
we
will
,
however
,
be
run
parent
workshop
and
group
very
soon
,
which
will
assess
parent
in
help
they
child
's
communication
and
prepare
child
for
preschool
amongst
many
other
area
.
I
be
in
the
process
of
finalise
this
workshop
with
my
team
and
you
will
receive
a
list
of
all
upcoming
intervention
very
soon
.
I
do
not
doubt
the
aim
of
the
community
development
network
team
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
they
be
try
to
do
they
good
.
however
,
for
parent
to
receive
a
email
like
that
on
behalf
of
a
child
send
a
signal
to
they
that
here
they
go
again
,
that
they
have
just
come
off
one
list
,
that
they
be
go
onto
another
one
and
that
they
have
not
really
progress
.
in
this
instance
the
child
have
be
wait
for
about
two
year
for
service
.
that
be
deeply
upsetting
for
that
family
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
use
she
good
office
to
put
pressure
on
the
team
through
the
cho
that
we
need
to
see
that
number
decrease
and
see
the
service
roll
out
,
that
would
give
a
lot
of
confidence
in
the
system
.
again
,
we
in
the
Labour
Party
will
support
the
legislation
-
there
be
no
question
about
that
-
but
what
we
want
to
see
be
the
evidence
of
the
system
work
for
child
.
before
I
sit
down
,
I
will
refer
to
one
of
my
local
organisation
,
the
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
.
there
be
a
great
grá
for
all
this
section
38
and
section
39
organisation
.
the
relationship
between
member
of
the
Oireachtas
and
this
organisation
be
excellent
and
we
all
try
to
do
we
very
good
to
ensure
that
service
be
roll
out
within
we
service
area
and
across
we
constituency
,
and
beyond
we
constituency
as
well
.
however
,
there
be
a
issue
in
Cooleens
respite
service
,
in
St.
Joseph's
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
intervene
with
St.
Joseph
's
with
a
view
to
have
that
facility
reopen
,
it
would
give
a
lot
of
relief
to
family
in
that
area
.
I
again
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
in
fairness
to
she
,
she
always
have
a
open
door
and
be
solution
-
drive
,
and
we
have
to
give
she
credit
for
that
,
but
there
be
more
work
to
be
do
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
amendment
no.
1
,
in
the
name
of
the
Minister
for
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
,
to
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
regard
renter
.
on
Tuesday
,
19
October
2021
,
on
the
question
,
"
that
the
amendment
to
the
motion
be
agree
to
"
,
a
division
be
claim
and
in
accordance
with
Standing
Order
80
(
2
)
,
that
division
must
be
take
now
.
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
,
further
down
the
speak
slot
,
it
allow
time
to
read
a
minister
of
State
's
speech
and
parse
the
word
.
in
support
this
Bill
,
in
the
same
spirit
as
we
have
always
do
,
we
would
continue
to
support
any
initiative
that
come
before
the
House
in
respect
of
highlight
the
continue
important
presence
of
credit
union
in
we
town
and
village
throughout
the
country
.
in
propose
a
amendment
to
the
Bill
,
the
Minister
of
State
state
that
it
be
deem
to
be
read
a
second
time
this
day
nine
month
to
allow
for
the
progression
of
the
review
of
policy
framework
,
which
be
at
a
advanced
stage
and
for
such
progression
to
be
take
into
account
in
further
scrutiny
of
this
Bill
.
at
face
value
,
it
would
appear
that
he
be
seek
to
engage
with
the
proposer
of
the
Bill
and
,
pend
the
review
,
see
where
stand
the
Bill
.
however
,
when
I
quote
from
he
speech
,
I
be
a
little
bit
disturb
by
some
of
the
word
,
which
suggest
that
the
contrary
be
the
case
.
he
start
by
state
,
"
the
potential
legislative
amendment
will
be
consider
as
part
of
the
review
"
.
the
key
point
be
he
statement
be
:
however
,
my
engagement
have
highlight
that
there
be
no
firm
consensus
as
to
the
desire
legislative
change
which
would
assist
in
solve
the
financial
challenge
to
the
sector
.
I
do
not
want
to
raise
unrealistic
expectation
about
the
potential
impact
of
any
such
change
,
if
it
be
approve
.
I
have
be
long
enough
around
the
House
,
include
have
serve
as
a
minister
of
State
,
to
recognise
the
code
language
in
that
.
that
suggest
that
the
government
have
no
intention
whatsoever
of
promulgate
this
Bill
.
it
may
be
that
the
only
exercise
if
the
Bill
be
to
succeed
be
that
the
review
have
to
be
fast
-
track
in
a
way
that
involve
engagement
with
all
of
the
stakeholder
.
even
if
the
pregnant
pause
,
to
use
deputy
Connolly
's
expression
,
that
have
now
replace
the
guillotine
be
to
be
implement
as
a
tool
,
it
be
a
coarse
tool
to
use
not
to
allow
legislation
to
proceed
to
committee
stage
.
however
,
if
the
one
thing
that
come
out
of
this
be
a
fast
-
tracking
of
the
review
such
that
the
stakeholder
feel
that
they
have
be
meaningfully
engage
with
,
then
that
might
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
.
it
be
hard
not
to
be
cynical
,
however
,
because
the
Minister
of
State
say
,
"
I
hope
to
update
the
House
in
the
not
too
distant
future
of
the
government
's
plan
to
support
the
credit
union
sector
"
.
there
be
too
many
if
and
but
.
the
language
be
nebulous
.
we
want
concrete
action
in
respect
of
a
sector
that
be
vital
to
the
functioning
of
this
society
.
there
be
3.6
million
credit
union
member
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
there
be
€
16.38
billion
in
savings
and
€
19.28
billion
in
asset
.
I
could
go
on
.
credit
union
have
be
consistently
vote
the
good
organisation
for
customer
experience
for
the
past
seven
year
.
credit
union
stakeholder
be
in
and
out
of
this
House
,
through
the
committee
structure
,
on
a
regular
basis
.
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
hear
from
all
of
we
be
a
genuine
plea
to
government
to
engage
with
stakeholder
in
the
credit
union
sector
so
that
credit
union
can
lend
productively
within
they
community
.
it
be
most
patronising
for
he
to
come
into
the
House
and
say
:
I
would
encourage
they
to
engage
more
with
local
community
group
,
voluntary
and
sport
organisation
to
increase
they
lending
.
its
in
keep
with
they
etho
and
social
value
to
the
community
.
I
be
speechless
at
that
remark
.
the
volunteer
in
credit
union
know
exactly
what
they
etho
,
mandate
and
mission
be
.
they
be
do
this
day
in
and
day
out
.
they
be
seek
to
lend
.
however
,
now
the
very
etho
that
underpin
the
credit
union
movement
be
be
hamper
by
regulatory
overreach
where
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
the
Central
Bank
now
control
whether
the
credit
union
can
pay
a
dividend
.
this
stick
in
the
craw
of
every
reasonable
and
rational
credit
union
member
who
ever
be
,
include
I
.
dividend
restriction
on
credit
union
by
the
Central
Bank
have
,
by
stealth
,
undermine
the
ethical
basis
through
which
credit
union
be
create
.
there
be
a
time
when
Fianna
Fáil
would
have
stand
up
to
the
Central
Bank
on
issue
like
this
.
there
be
a
time
when
Fianna
Fáil
would
have
push
back
against
the
Central
Bank
on
this
.
the
way
to
push
back
against
the
Central
Bank
on
this
now
be
to
put
in
place
a
proper
policy
framework
so
that
credit
union
can
realise
they
full
potential
throughout
Ireland
and
within
the
very
community
that
we
represent
.
I
do
not
know
what
the
modus
operandi
of
the
Central
Bank
be
,
but
be
high
time
that
we
reach
a
point
where
it
and
the
Department
of
Finance
pull
back
a
little
and
consider
the
potential
of
the
sector
.
give
the
stark
reduction
in
the
number
of
credit
union
throughout
the
State
,
there
be
the
danger
of
a
existential
threat
to
they
very
existence
in
some
of
the
community
mention
here
today
where
bank
have
go
to
ground
.
there
be
no
oversight
of
the
Central
Bank
by
other
central
bank
in
respect
of
the
regulation
of
credit
union
.
I
reiterate
the
point
about
dividend
restriction
.
there
be
no
other
country
in
western
Europe
where
there
have
be
transformational
change
in
governance
in
credit
union
.
that
involve
be
volunteer
who
have
go
through
a
process
and
have
do
everything
that
have
be
ask
of
they
in
term
of
governance
and
meeting
requirement
.
it
be
time
to
give
they
a
fair
chance
,
take
the
foot
off
they
neck
and
let
they
thrive
.
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
,
EPA
,
have
publish
a
report
on
urban
wastewater
treatment
.
Raw
sewage
be
be
discharge
from
34
town
and
village
.
we
be
tell
construction
will
start
on
14
location
this
year
and
eight
in
2022
.
a
third
of
this
town
and
village
will
continue
to
release
raw
sewage
after
2024
.
the
report
identify
a
number
of
location
specifically
in
Cork
.
Cobh
,
thankfully
,
be
to
be
resolve
this
year
,
but
Ballycotton
,
Whitegate
,
Aghada
and
Mitchelstown
be
plan
for
late
in
the
decade
,
as
be
Inchigeelagh
.
the
EPA
's
concern
be
that
repeat
plan
over
the
year
have
not
be
act
upon
.
this
be
not
just
a
ecological
and
environmental
issue
.
the
lack
of
this
facility
be
also
impact
on
the
housing
crisis
.
for
many
young
people
with
mortgage
approval
in
town
like
Mitchelstown
where
there
be
capacity
constraint
who
wish
to
see
house
build
and
where
builder
with
site
be
ready
to
go
,
the
EPA
report
make
for
very
grim
reading
.
I
ask
the
Taoiseach
to
give
this
he
priority
.
deputy
-----
there
will
be
a
opportunity
to
come
in
during
the
question
and
answer
session
.
you
be
encroach
the
time
allocate
to
deputy
Connolly
.
I
will
let
in
the
deputy
again
during
the
question
and
answer
session
.
that
conclude
the
speak
slot
and
20
minute
be
now
allocate
for
a
question
and
answer
session
.
there
be
a
protocol
whereby
we
will
move
through
various
group
in
the
Opposition
.
question
have
be
raise
and
I
propose
to
move
now
to
the
Sinn
Féin
allocation
of
time
in
this
session
.
we
can
then
move
through
the
various
Member
.
I
propose
to
allocate
five
minute
for
the
Minister
of
State
to
conclude
after
the
20
-
minute
slot
,
but
that
be
probably
not
enough
time
for
he
to
wrap
up
and
answer
all
the
question
.
I
therefore
propose
to
stick
with
the
order
of
speaker
and
move
to
the
question
and
answer
session
.
I
be
hopeful
there
will
be
enough
time
at
the
end
.
perhaps
ten
minute
within
the
20
-
minute
slot
will
be
sufficient
for
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
the
other
question
.
before
the
Minister
of
State
address
the
question
,
I
wish
to
clarify
that
I
propose
to
go
to
People
before
Profit
-
solidarity
,
the
Regional
Group
,
the
rural
independent
Group
and
the
independent
Group
.
I
call
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
.
if
we
can
be
as
concise
as
possible
,
we
will
get
more
in
.
more
people
will
have
a
second
chance
to
come
in
if
the
deputy
allow
the
Minister
of
State
to
answer
.
I
now
propose
to
move
to
the
rural
independent
Group
.
if
we
can
keep
we
question
concise
,
more
people
will
be
allow
to
come
in
afterwards
.
there
be
less
than
two
minute
leave
in
this
component
of
the
debate
.
the
Minister
of
State
state
early
that
he
want
some
time
to
address
the
question
raise
by
other
Member
.
I
propose
that
we
do
that
now
.
after
this
slot
,
there
be
a
further
five
minute
for
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
the
debate
in
total
.

I
again
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
very
important
issue
of
the
provision
of
the
ambulance
base
locate
in
Carlow
town
.
I
do
not
have
the
information
on
what
area
be
high
on
the
list
but
I
will
try
to
get
that
information
from
the
minister
and
I
will
ask
he
to
forward
it
to
the
deputy
.
in
line
with
Sláintecare
and
Vision
2020
,
a
significant
programme
of
work
be
under
way
to
transform
the
National
Ambulance
Service
from
a
emergency
medical
service
into
a
mobile
medical
service
.
this
be
a
model
that
aim
to
treat
patient
at
the
low
appropriate
level
of
acuity
,
result
in
a
good
experience
for
the
patient
and
a
more
efficient
use
of
resource
.
as
the
deputy
rightly
say
,
Carlow
ambulance
base
be
a
integral
part
of
the
ambulance
service
.
she
praise
the
advanced
paramedic
,
the
ambulance
service
and
all
the
staff
and
I
join
with
she
in
that
.
they
have
do
great
work
,
not
just
in
Carlow
and
the
south
east
but
across
the
country
.
they
have
certainly
save
life
and
we
be
very
proud
of
they
.
the
capital
spend
on
ambulance
base
facility
be
a
integral
part
of
the
ambulance
service
and
be
prioritise
by
the
National
Ambulance
Service
to
meet
the
requirement
of
that
basis
with
the
high
need
.
this
year
,
a
unprecedented
€
187.5
million
be
be
invest
in
the
National
Ambulance
Service
.
this
include
€
10
million
in
additional
funding
to
progress
priority
area
in
line
with
the
National
Ambulance
Service
strategic
reform
,
include
continue
to
target
capacity
deficit
as
identify
in
the
National
Ambulance
Service
emergency
service
baseline
and
capacity
review
.
again
,
engagement
be
continue
between
the
National
Ambulance
Service
and
HSE
estate
in
progress
the
capital
submission
for
a
replacement
base
.
the
Labour
Party
will
also
support
the
Bill
,
while
reserve
the
right
to
bring
forward
amendment
on
Committee
stage
.
on
the
issue
of
scrambler
,
specifically
,
it
be
most
welcome
to
see
some
overdue
action
on
they
use
,
and
that
of
quad
bike
and
other
vehicle
,
when
they
be
associate
with
antisocial
behaviour
.
we
know
there
have
a
number
of
private
member
'
bill
on
this
matter
over
the
year
and
action
to
tackle
it
cannot
come
soon
enough
.
in
particular
,
we
pay
tribute
to
the
former
Lord
Mayor
of
Dublin
,
Andrew
Montague
,
who
have
be
critical
of
the
scourge
of
this
vehicle
for
many
year
now
.
despite
the
Road
traffic
act
and
other
relevant
legislation
available
in
this
area
,
Garda
authority
have
indicate
that
the
use
of
quad
bike
and
scrambler
by
minor
and
youth
in
public
park
have
prove
difficult
to
deal
with
from
a
enforcement
perspective
.
member
of
a
Garda
Síochána
be
instruct
not
to
pursue
youth
on
quad
bike
,
scrambler
and
so
on
,
owe
to
the
inherent
safety
risk
in
pursue
this
vehicle
.
if
such
pursuit
be
to
take
place
,
there
would
be
a
high
risk
of
they
end
in
collision
at
speed
,
result
in
serious
injury
or
death
.
as
a
result
,
bring
this
vehicle
to
a
stop
be
challenging
.
we
welcome
any
attempt
to
stamp
out
that
scourge
via
legislation
.
that
be
to
be
welcome
in
the
Bill
.
we
hope
the
Minister
of
State
will
offer
some
clarity
,
however
,
in
respect
of
the
practicality
of
stop
young
offender
on
dangerous
vehicle
.
the
problem
surround
the
misuse
of
quad
bike
and
scrambler
have
become
more
and
more
prevalent
in
the
past
five
year
and
in
the
past
few
year
there
have
be
some
particularly
tragic
end
for
individual
use
this
vehicle
.
a
number
of
accident
,
some
fatal
,
have
be
cause
by
individual
on
scrambler
motorcycle
collide
with
or
drive
into
park
car
.
by
restrict
where
such
vehicle
can
lawfully
drive
,
we
would
hold
they
accountable
to
safe
driving
practice
,
not
just
for
the
safety
of
the
public
but
also
they
own
,
as
we
need
to
protect
they
as
well
.
the
sad
fact
be
that
many
owner
of
such
vehicle
who
engage
in
antisocial
behaviour
be
young
and
inexperienced
driver
who
seek
the
thrill
of
drive
recklessly
and
think
it
be
above
the
odd
that
they
will
be
involve
in
a
accident
.
we
welcome
the
provision
within
the
legislation
.
however
,
we
will
be
seek
further
clarity
on
how
they
will
be
police
thereafter
.
there
be
another
provision
within
the
Bill
on
which
I
seek
clarity
.
it
relate
to
the
power
of
a
Bord
Pleanála
.
as
I
understand
it
,
new
power
will
be
vested
in
a
Bord
Pleanála
to
permit
new
road
,
which
could
theoretically
supersede
any
local
development
plan
or
county
development
plan
.
I
seek
clarity
on
this
because
my
thinking
on
it
may
not
be
absolutely
correct
.
as
I
understand
it
,
a
new
power
be
to
be
vested
in
a
Bord
Pleanála
to
approve
scheme
or
propose
road
development
that
could
materially
contravene
any
county
development
plan
.
section
45
of
the
Bill
state
:
the
Act
of
1993
be
amend
by
the
insertion
of
the
follow
section
after
section
51a
:
''

.
a

(
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
of
2000
)
only
if
it
consider
that
one
of
the
follow
be
the
case
:
(
a
)
the
scheme
or
propose
road
development
be
of
strategic
,
regional
or
national
importance
;
(
b
)
there
be

in
the

or
the

be
not
clearly

,
insofar
as

or
propose

be
concerned
;
(
c
)
the

or

should
be

regard
to
the
transport
strategy
make
under
section
12
of
the
Dublin
Transport
Authority
Act
2008

under
section
28
of
the

under

29
of
the

the

and
any
relevant
policy
of
the
government
,
the
minister
for
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
or any
minister
of
the
government
.
there
be
other
area
but
I
do
not
need
to
quote
they
.
where
do
local
area
plan
and
county
development
plan
stand
in
light
of
this
new
provision
?
be
it
the
case
that
a
Bord
Pleanála
will
supersede
by
its
action
any
plan
that
have
be
make
by
the
member
via
the
reserve
function
they
have
on
local
authority
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
my
initial
reaction
be
that
that
would
be
a
worry
trend
.
it
could
be
argue
that
there
be
regulatory
overreach
inherent
in
that
provision
.
however
,
I
remain
open
-
minded
and
I
await
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
to
that
fear
.
I
be
sure
she
will
allay
my
fear
.
I
have
no
doubt
about
that
.
however
,
I
feel
it
be
important
to
raise
this
as
a
issue
,
particularly
as
local
authority
member
guard
preciously
they
right
to
make
they
plan
in
the
good
interest
of
the
people
they
represent
in
the
area
they
represent
.
I
seek
further
clarity
on
that
issue
.
there
be
another
issue
that
be
not
pertinent
to
this
Bill
,
but
give
that
the
Bill
speak
to
road
safety
and
ensure
that
there
be
a
regime
and
a
system
in
this
country
whereby
road
user
have
the
benefit
of
robust
legislation
to
ensure
they
can
go
about
they
business
in
the
good
way
possible
,
I
will
raise
it
.
as
we
know
,
driver
testing
be
now
control
by
the
Road
Safety
Authority
,
RSA
.
I
have
be
inform
that
32
tester
be
about
to
have
they
contract
terminate
between
December
of
this
year
and
April
of
next
year
,
across
three
cohort
.
I
worry
greatly
about
that
because
during
the
lockdown
,
each
and
every
one
of
we
be
inundate
with
request
from
we
constituent
about
driver
testing
,
whether
that
be
the
theory
test
,
the
practical
test
or
people
not
get
timely
date
for
testing
and
be
send
all
over
the
country
in
order
to
pursue
they
test
as
candidate
.
that
be
particularly
true
in
respect
of
the
theory
test
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
driver
tester
employ
through
the
RSA
be
to
be
let
go
,
and
I
understand
there
be
32
in
this
cohort
who
be
on
temporary
contract
at
present
,
then
I
worry
greatly
about
the
throughput
of
applicant
who
might
get
catch
in
the
cross
hair
of
that
job
loss
if
they
be
to
occur
.
I
seek
some
latitude
from
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
on
this
as
I
know
it
be
not
germane
to
the
Bill
.
I
fully
appreciate
that
but
it
do
speak
to
the
issue
of
road
safety
.
if
32
driver
tester
be
to
be
let
go
by
the
RSA
,
that
would
do
any
confidence
there
be
within
the
system
.
some
clarity
on
that
would
be
very
welcome
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
the
role
of
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
in
planning
application
.
it
go
back
to
the
point
I
make
specifically
about
the
new
role
to
be
define
for
a
Bord
Pleanála
.
we
all
know
that
on
national
secondary
route
in
particular
,
when
planning
application
come
in
from
genuine
applicant
who
be
seek
to
build
house
,
sometimes
on
family
-
own
land
and
very
often
on
a
site
they
would
have
acquire
or
be
acquire
subject
to
planning
permission
,
when
they
make
the
application
to
the
local
authority
,
correspondence
be
put
on
the
file
by
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
as
regard
its
perceive
opposition
to
any
planning
application
make
to
a
local
authority
where
they
be
contiguous
to
,
adjacent
to
or
in
close
proximity
to
a
national
secondary
route
.
at
face
value
,
that
would
appear
,
theoretically
,
to
be
laudable
as
it
would
ensure
there
be
not
more
vehicle
come
out
onto
a
national
primary
or
secondary
route
.
however
,
it
seem
to
have
become
practice
regardless
of
take
into
account
the
particular
mitigating
circumstance
of
individual
planning
application
.
where
there
be
genuine
application
make
for
housing
on
the
basis
of
a
genuine
need
and
fulfil
all
the
condition
as
lay
down
in
rural
planning
guideline
,
there
seem
to
be
a
root
-
and
-
branch
rule
by
TII
to
write
submission
on
planning
application
.
it
do
not
quite
oppose
they
but
it
express
reservation
.
this
seem
to
be
a
uniform
approach
and
it
be
have
a
detrimental
impact
on
the
ability
of
people
to
build
house
in
rural
area
.
be
this
something
that
could
be
look
at
in
the
context
of
either
planning
or
road
safety
?
we
all
accept
TII
's
bona
fide
.
however
,
from
time
to
time
there
be
mitigating
circumstance
and
it
be
perceive
to
be
overly
strident
in
its
attitude
towards
individual
planning
application
where
there
be
mitigating
circumstance
.
that
be
a
issue
that
affect
thousand
of
people
right
across
the
State
who
seek
to
make
a
planning
application
.
it
would
be
remiss
of
I
,
as
I
have
do
so
previously
privately
,
not
to
mention
the
N73
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
Road
.
it
be
a
national
secondary
route
and
arguably
one
of
the
bad
such
route
in
the
country
.
if
I
have
the
mandate
and
the
power
to
amend
the
Bill
-----
-----such
that
I
could
get
the
N73
route
stitch
into
that
Bill
and
secure
the
allocation
of
€
8
million
to
€
10
million
to
complete
that
3
kilometer
stretch
of
road
,
I
would
do
that
.
unfortunately
,
I
be
a
opposition
politician
-----
-----
and
I
be
seek
to
do
my
good
for
my
constituent
in
Cork
East
.
if
there
be
anything
the
Minister
of
State
can
do
,
through
she
good
office
,
to
influence
TII
to
get
that
3
kilometer
stretch
of
the
N73
complete
,
that
would
be
great
.
it
be
a
national
secondary
route
that
serve
that
travel
between
Kerry
and
Dublin
.
it
be
a
vital
arterial
route
for
trade
,
commerce
and
resident
's
daily
journey
.
Cork
County
Council
have
prepare
the
tender
document
for
it
.
if
there
be
a
way
in
which
we
could
get
it
to
the
next
stage
where
that
money
could
be
allocate
,
it
would
be
a
great
day
's
work
for
everybody
involve
.
it
would
be
remiss
of
I
not
to
speak
on
a
road
traffic
Bill
without
be
parochial
.
I
be
unashamedly
parochial
in
this
instance
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
for
she
forbearance
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
.
we
welcome
the
attempt
by
the
government
and
by
the
Minister
of
State
to
address
a
wide
array
of
issue
.
we
acknowledge
that
the
transport
committee
do
much
good
work
on
the
pre-legislative
scrutiny
of
the
Bill
.
on
that
basis
,
we
will
be
support
the
Bill
on
second
stage
.
I
spare
the
House
six
minute
.
I
welcome
this
debate
and
the
enthusiasm
of
the
minister
,
who
clearly
know
he
brief
.
it
be
opportune
that
we
be
discuss
Science
Week
.
I
be
a
former
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
.
I
be
particularly
proud
of
the
fact
that
I
be
there
at
the
inception
of
APC
,
Insight
,
IPIC
,
Lero
and
MaREI
in
particular
,
give
the
importance
of
potential
offshore
wind
energy
.
I
also
pay
tribute
to
the
people
who
you
do
not
see
in
public
.
they
be
the
people
behind
the
scene
of
Science
Week
,
in
the
Discover
science
programme
,
in
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
the
people
who
help
to
create
the
tool
for
the
week
,
and
the
people
who
develop
the
continuous
professional
development
programme
.
they
be
the
unseen
people
who
be
the
real
heroe
of
science
week
.
they
disseminate
the
science
or
assist
in
its
dissemination
,
either
as
teacher
or
in
the
various
show
and
event
that
take
place
.
they
be
the
real
heroe
because
they
facilitate
the
capturing
of
imagination
and
inculcate
in
young
mind
the
idea
that
scientific
endeavour
be
worthy
of
pursuit
.
we
owe
they
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
the
hide
work
that
be
too
often
underappreciated
.
I
express
my
appreciation
of
they
work
.
I
welcome
that
there
be
to
be
decoupling
of
the
role
of
chief
scientific
adviser
from
that
of
director
general
of
SFI
.
it
be
long
overdue
and
be
never
intend
to
last
ten
year
when
the
minister
and
I
be
part
of
the
government
of
the
day
.
it
be
a
function
of
a
rationalisation
and
cost
programme
.
I
have
often
wonder
how
many
time
the
chief
scientific
adviser
advise
the
government
on
issue
of
scientific
exploration
or
public
concern
in
the
intervene
period
.
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
that
.
Science
Foundation
Ireland
and
its
board
as
a
funder
have
always
seek
to
be
as
rigorous
as
possible
when
it
come
to
funding
decision
.
however
,
one
must
never
allow
the
perception
to
develop
that
there
could
be
a
conflict
of
interest
between
the
two
.
I
will
speak
on
initial
teacher
education
because
if
we
do
not
have
science
teacher
,
we
do
not
have
Science
week
.
there
be
a
serious
issue
in
respect
of
the
professional
master
of
education
,
pme
,
and
the
pressure
trainee
or
candidate
teacher
be
under
in
the
master
's
programme
.
they
be
work
quite
well
but
it
will
take
time
for
the
throughput
to
be
such
that
we
have
a
ready
supply
.
the
minister
be
aware
of
that
.
a
interesting
study
conduct
by
Dr.
Mark
Prendergast
,
Dr.
Melanie
Ní
Dhuinn
and
Professor
Andrew
Loxley
of
University
College
Cork
and
Trinity
College
Dublin
be
title
:
"
'
I
worry
about
money
every
day
'
:
the
financial
stress
of
second
-
level
initial
teacher
education
in
Ireland
"
.
if
the
minister
and
he
official
take
a
moment
to
read
that
report
,
they
will
see
how
stressful
it
be
to
be
a
candidate
on
the
pme
as
we
speak
.
the
research
,
which
be
conduct
on
a
cohort
of
391
people
,
seek
respondent
's
view
on
how
they
be
get
on
through
they
course
of
study
.
it
record
"
cost
,
...
financial
and
emotional
,
of
enter
the
teaching
profession
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
.
"
when
the
author
look
at
Finland
,
Ontario
and
Singapore
,
the
lesson
arise
from
that
comparative
study
be
that
,
as
a
policy
intervention
,
this
country
overlook
the
idea
of
pay
prospective
teacher
in
initial
teacher
education
some
fund
to
allow
they
to
allay
the
financial
and
other
difficulty
in
which
they
find
themselves
.
that
can
be
do
either
through
the
cost
of
the
course
,
which
be
relatively
high
,
or
through
facilitate
by
means
of
subsidisation
the
ability
of
initial
teacher
education
candidate
,
particularly
in
stem
field
,
to
be
utterly
focus
on
the
task
at
hand
,
thus
guarantee
a
supply
and
throughput
of
teacher
and
allay
the
current
issue
around
teacher
shortage
.
the
study
find
that
:
...
perhaps
one
lesson
which
have
be
overlook
be
that
all
three
country
[
Finland
,
Ontario
,
Singapore
]
subsidise
the
preparation
of
teacher
.
for
example
,
become
a
teacher
in
Singapore
and
Finland
be
completely
pay
for
,
and
candidate
earn
money
whilst
train
.
in
Ontario
,
there
be
a
quota
of
4500
free
place
.
I
be
not
try
to
be
unrealistic
but
if
we
be
serious
about
the
shortage
of
teacher
,
particularly
in
area
such
as
STEM
,
this
study
clearly
show
there
be
major
pressure
on
teacher
and
trainee
teacher
.
a
example
I
encounter
today
concern
a
trainee
teacher
do
a
placement
in
a
post
-
primary
school
who
be
ask
to
do
a
substitution
role
.
that
be
arguably
unethical
.
it
may
be
understandable
from
the
principal
's
point
of
view
but
the
candidate
will
not
be
pay
for
it
.
that
have
a
impact
on
the
trainee
teacher
's
ability
to
study
.
if
we
talk
about
Science
Week
and
STEM
graduate
,
we
need
to
go
back
to
how
the
teacher
education
system
work
to
have
a
qualitative
look
at
that
candidate
's
experience
and
whether
more
can
be
do
from
a
policy
point
of
view
.

there

to
clarify
,
question
from
Deputy
O'Connor
,
Griffin
,
Carey
and
Richmond
have
be
group
with
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
's
question
.
I
will
now
revert
to
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
.
we
will
then
take
the
other
speaker
in
sequence
.
one
minute
.
I
advise
the
Deputy
to
keep
they
eye
on
the
clock
.
I
thank
deputy
Cahill
for
share
time
.
I
congratulate
he
,
as
the
chairman
,
and
all
the
member
of
the
Joint
committee
on
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
,
for
bring
forward
this
report
.
in
the
short
time
available
to
I
,
I
acknowledge
the
work
of
the
social
economic
Environmental
Forestry
Association
,
SEEFA
,
which
as
a
organisation
have
do
much
to
raise
consciousness
concern
afforestation
and
felling
issue
.
as
we
speak
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
COP26
meeting
,
we
be
fell
more
tree
and
grant
more
licence
to
fall
tree
than
we
be
grant
licence
to
plant
tree
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
.
we
have
the
forestry
licensing
dashboard
before
we
to
show
we
proof
of
that
.
the
total
number
of
afforested
hectare
be
3598
,
but
for
fell
it
be
24185
.
we
be
cut
down
more
tree
than
we
be
planting
.
that
be
a
real
-
time
analysis
of
where
we
stand
regard
forestry
policy
in
this
country
.
the
situation
must
be
reverse
.
in
she
speech
,
the
Minister
of
State
will
tell
we
that
more
ecologist
have
be
appoint
.
that
be
all
well
and
good
,
and
I
do
not
doubt
the
bona
fide
of
the
Minister
of
State
.
however
,
I
have
a
call
from
a
woman
in
my
area
of
Cork
today
who
be
tear
she
hair
out
because
she
have
be
ask
for
another
Natura
impact
statement
,
NIS
,
even
though
she
have
propose
a
forestry
plan
to
she
consultant
.
something
be
still
wrong
in
the
department
regard
how
felling
licence
be
be
deal
with
.
notwithstanding
the
appointment
of
more
ecologist
,
a
massive
gap
remain
and
the
metric
show
that
clearly
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
delve
deep
into
the
licensing
process
in
a
way
that
will
ensure
it
will
be
possible
to
get
rid
of
the
low
hanging
fruit
,
no
pun
intend
,
to
enable
all
the
small
application
be
deal
with
for
fell
licence
,
then
she
would
be
do
a
good
day
's
work
.
on
the
afforestation
side
,
we
take
we
lead
from
people
such
as
Jo
O'Hara
and
deputy
Cahill
,
as
the
chair
of
the
relevant
committee
,
and
the
Mackinnon
report
concern
what
need
to
be
do
to
ensure
proper
afforestation
and
the
proper
management
and
felling
of
we
forest
.
that
must
be
do
to
ensure
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
late
cop
meeting
,
that
we
can
sequester
carbon
and
put
in
place
,
as
deputy
Cahill
say
,
through
the
next
round
of
the
CAP
programme
,
a
system
that
embed
the
idea
that
forestry
will
become
a
integral
part
of
that
programme
.
farmer
will
not
mind
if
such
a
system
be
part
of
Pillar
1
or
Pillar
2
of
CAP
.
forestry
,
however
,
must
be
embed
into
eco-scheme
and
agri-environment
climate
measure
.
it
should
be
self
-
evident
to
everybody
in
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
that
forestry
must
get
the
prominence
it
deserve
.
it
be
a
vital
sector
,
and
we
must
ensure
that
not
only
do
we
have
a
sustainable
forestry
sector
but
that
we
also
recognise
the
potential
that
afforestation
bring
in
help
we
to
meet
we
carbon
emission
target
.
I
would
also
support
any
measure
put
in
place
to
address
the
issue
of
ash
dieback
.
that
farmer
,
forester
and
landowner
be
do
everything
they
can
.
again
,
they
be
also
tear
they
hair
out
because
of
the
inaction
of
the
Department
on
this
matter
.
we
again
have
a
situation
where
the
fact
speak
for
themselves
.
we
be
import
timber
for
we
sawmill
.
on
one
hand
,
we
have
ash
dieback
,
but
,
on
the
other
,
we
do
not
know
what
kind
of
policing
there
be
of
pest
such
as
the
spruce
beetle
.
the
control
in
place
do
not
allow
we
to
know
what
be
come
into
the
country
and
,
therefore
,
we
do
not
know
what
be
come
down
the
line
in
the
context
of
what
be
be
import
.
we
need
the
afforestation
programme
to
at
least
hit
a
target
commensurate
with
the
programme
for
government
target
at
a
minimum
.
when
I
seek
,
in
my
modest
way
,
to
have
sectoral
target
for
forestry
include
in
the
climate
action
and
low
carbon
development
(
amendment
)
act
2021
,
let
we
call
a
spade
a
spade
and
say
that
the
Green
Party
Minister
refuse
to
accept
that
amendment
.
we
have
a
massive
opportunity
in
this
area
and
I
welcome
this
report
.
this
be
a
timely
debate
,
and
I
thank
deputy
Cahill
for
share
he
time
.
we
wish
the
Minister
of
State
well
in
achieve
she
objective
.

I
welcome
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
.
we
be
support
it
.
I
want
to
speak
on
two
specific
scenario
as
they
relate
to
my
county
of
Cork
.
they
certainly
reflect
the
experience
of
the
Sinn
Féin
Deputy
as
they
relate
story
from
they
constituency
.
a
email
I
receive
from
a
person
state
that
on
the
previous
Saturday
a
elderly
man
aged
85
crash
into
two
park
car
on
the
side
of
the
Ballyhooly
road
come
out
of
Glanworth
.
I
be
be
deliberately
parochial
because
it
need
to
be
highlight
.
the
email
state
:
the
man
call
the
ambulance
immediately
.
the
man
be
inform
the
ambulance
would
be
20
minute
.
I
offer
1st
aid
at
the
scene
.
the
man
appear
ok
but
have
pain
in
chest
and
down
he
left
arm
.
the
fire
brigade
attend
the
scene
quickly
...
the
man
be
keep
in
the
car
wait
for
the
ambulance
.
the
fire
brigade
crew
keep
he
as
comfortable
as
possible
with
blanket
and
a
tarpaulin
.
the
emergency
service
tell
the
man
that
he
ambulance
have
be
divert
to
a
heart
attack
and
he
ambulance
be
cancel
.
a
advanced
paramedic
do
arrive
about
1.5
hour
after
the
accident
have
happen
.
around
the
same
time
a
local
doctor
...
see
the
light
and
come
to
help
.
the
gardai
be
on
the
scene
throughout
.
eventually
2.5
hour
after
the
accident
,
as
the
night
be
cold
and
wet
,
the
man
have
to
be
take
from
the
car
and
bring
to
a
neighbour
's
house
for
he
health
and
safety
.
at
this
point
there
be
5
fire
engine
,
3
garda
vehicle
and
a
advanced
paramedic
on
the
scene
.
they
be
able
to
clear
the
rd
and
open
it
again
.
it
be
3
hour
20
minute
before
a
ambulance
eventually
come
and
it
be
4
hour
after
the
accident
before
the
man
leave
in
the
ambulance
for
hospital
.
this
be
quite
a
typical
case
.
I
mention
the
location
because
I
want
to
put
on
record
that
it
be
a
rural
area
in
Cork
but
no
more
than
a
20
-
minute
drive
from
Cork
city
and
the
near
tertiary
hospital
and
no
more
than
half
a
hour
from
the
near
secondary
care
facility
.
this
be
happen
and
it
need
to
be
acknowledge
.
I
grant
that
the
minister
have
acknowledge
the
problem
.
I
absolutely
accept
that
he
have
say
more
financial
resource
be
be
deploy
to
deal
with
the
issue
and
that
he
be
in
the
process
of
recruiting
200
additional
paramedic
who
be
go
through
the
system
.
there
be
a
legitimate
expectation
on
the
part
of
every
citizen
to
expect
that
emergency
service
operate
on
the
basis
of
the
pre-hospital
emergency
care
guideline
and
that
there
be
a
time
limit
by
which
each
call
will
be
triage
.
it
be
very
clear
to
I
that
if
there
have
be
a
change
in
the
protocol
when
people
ring
the
emergency
phone
line
call
for
a
ambulance
,
that
change
have
not
be
communicate
to
we
citizen
.
if
there
have
be
a
shift
in
what
people
's
legitimate
expectation
be
in
respect
of
a
ambulance
come
to
a
scene
and
if
there
have
be
some
change
in
this
protocol
then
they
certainly
have
not
be
communicate
to
the
public
.
this
need
to
be
address
.
notwithstanding
all
of
this
,
the
simple
thing
that
occur
in
the
incident
I
detailed
be
that
there
should
not
have
be
any
ambiguity
in
any
protocol
for
pre-hospital
guideline
involve
a
85
-
year
-
old
man
in
a
road
traffic
accident
.
there
should
not
be
any
ambiguity
about
the
need
to
ensure
that
a
ambulance
arrive
on
time
and
within
the
pre-hospital
guideline
.
this
be
why
I
be
articulate
the
case
.
I
also
receive
the
follow
email
from
a
paramedic
:
I
be
a
paramedic
in
the
National
Ambulance
Service
and
I
have
recently
learn
of
a
Bantry
/
Fermoy
ambulance
crew
who
crash
return
to
base
...
apparently
a
result
of
exhaustion
.
the
crew
in
question
have
clock
up
600
kilometer
+
in
one
shift
.
thankfully
neither
the
crew
or
another
road
user
be
seriously
injure
...
the
crew
escape
with
little
or
no
injury
however
the
next
time
the
crew
,
the
potential
patient
they
carry
and
other
road
user
may
not
be
so
lucky
.
this
be
a
result
of
NEOC
(
national
emergency
operational
control
)
and
national
ambulance
service
management
refuse
to
treat
paramedic
/
emt
with
the
dignity
they
be
entitle
to
and
deserve
this
run
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
.
it
really
do
need
to
be
sort
.
we
welcome
the
motion
.
I
be
delighted
to
see
it
this
evening
.
in
this
country
at
present
,
not
only
be
people
not
guarantee
access
to
a
gp
or
access
to
a
out
-
of
-
hour
gp
service
,
they
cannot
even
be
sure
whether
they
will
get
a
ambulance
if
they
need
it
.
something
be
go
seriously
wrong
.
the
place
be
go
to
hell
in
a
handcart
fairly
lively
.
I
know
we
be
in
the
middle
of
a
pandemic
.
we
all
understand
this
.
the
testimony
the
minister
have
hear
this
evening
be
crucial
.
we
need
to
see
the
ship
be
turn
around
quickly
to
ensure
people
have
confidence
that
the
system
will
deliver
for
they
and
that
at
a
very
minimum
a
85
-
year
-
old
man
could
have
the
legitimate
expectation
for
all
of
he
year
that
if
he
be
involved
in
a
road
traffic
accident
,
the
case
would
be
prioritise
.
the
issue
raise
by
deputy
Cullinane
on
the
length
of
time
that
ambulance
spend
in
emergency
department
need
to
be
tackle
.
it
be
not
good
enough
for
the
minister
to
say
HSE
have
commission
a
review
into
the
issue
with
a
view
to
identify
which
remedial
measure
might
assist
in
the
efficient
release
of
ambulance
resource
from
emergency
department
.
we
have
know
for
age
that
this
have
be
go
on
.
I
could
not
put
a
timeline
on
it
.
the
dog
on
the
street
know
that
ambulance
have
be
back
up
at
emergency
department
since
Adam
be
a
boy
.
the
day
for
come
into
the
House
-----
----
with
that
kind
of
language
be
gone
.
we
need
a
response
.
I
apologise
to
my
colleague
,
deputy
Nash
,
for
go
on
.

the

set
-
up
in

application
in
case
where
parent
have
go
through
or
be
go
through
marital
separation
be
that
they
must
provide
proof

that
be
set
out
in
A15
of
the
application
process
,
which
provide
for
the
necessity
to
provide
evidence
of
separation
.
it
state
:
please
provide
one
of
the
follow
as
proof
of
separation
or
divorce
:
separation
agreement
;
divorce
decree
;
court
order
maintenance

;

of

for

from

&
Protection
confirm
receipt
of

or
a

there
be

,
a
letter
from
you
solicitor
,
in
which
you
solicitor
confirm
separation
and
/
or
that
legal
proceedings
be
pend
...
there
be
other
criterion
that
a
person
have
to
meet
as
well
.
we
have
a
very
good
relationship
with
SUSI
,
which
I
deal
with
on
a
daily
basis
.
I
can
confirm
the
professionalism
of
the
people
we
deal
with
in
SUSI
.
however
,
what
I
see
be
clear
evidence
that
there
be
a
problem
.
where
there
be
a
family
separation
and
applicant
clearly
meet
the
threshold
of
the
proof
set
out
in
A15
,
have
furnish
the
document
,
in
a
statistically
significant
number
of
case
where
the
application
for
the
grant
be
refuse
,
the
subsequent
SUSI
appeal
fail
because
SUSI
uphold
the
decision
to
refuse
on
the
basis
that
the
A15
provision
be
not
be
meet
.
when
we
subsequently
guide
the
applicant
through
the
student
grant
appeal
board
,
in
most
case
the
decision
to
refuse
be
overturn
by
the
board
.
there
be
a
issue
regard
how
the
assessor
assess
the
separation
element
of
a
SUSI
application
.
it
be
we
view
that
they
be
not
adequately
take
into
account
the
proof
that
applicant
provide
.
I
ask
that
the
Department
engage
with
SUSI
to
conduct
a
look
-
back
of
a
parcel
of
case
where
there
have
be
a
refusal
by
SUSI
and
a
subsequent
awarding
of
a
grant
by
the
student
grant
appeal
board
.
there
have
be
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
number
of
separation
during
the
pandemic
.
I
be
find
that
it
be
often
the
case
with
application
for
SUSI
grant
that
,
where
applicant
provide
proof
of
separation
,
they
be
be
put
through
the
wringer
and
a
unnecessary
burden
and
stress
be
be
place
upon
they
.
the
proof
of
this
be
that
,
when
such
application
be
refuse
,
a
statistically
significant
number
of
refusal
be
overturn
by
the
student
grant
appeal
board
.
we
would
like
the
Department
to
examine
this
matter
in
concert
with
SUSI
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
consider
and
sympathetic
response
.
it
be
clear
that
he
be
on
top
of
this
issue
.
rather
than
my
furnish
he
with
specific
case
,
though
,
I
will
make
a
request
.
give
that
there
be
enough
in
he
acknowledgement
that
"
it
be
a
matter
for
SUSI
to
determine
what
evidence
it
will
accept
as
proof
of
separation
"
,
will
he
signal
to
he
official
to
liaise
with
SUSI
on
do
a
simple
look
-
back
and
require
SUSI
to
furnish
the
number
of
case
?
while
I
know
that
there
be
a
statistically
significant
number
among
the
overall
number
of
case
that
I
deal
with
in
my
constituency
office
,
the
chance
be
that
this
be
happen
throughout
every
constituency
.
therefore
,
I
respectfully
ask
that
the
Minister
of
State
,
through
he
good
office
,
take
it
upon
himself
to
ask
he
official
to
engage
with
SUSI
and
seek
a
look
-
back
or
review
-
it
would
be
a
simple
administrative
exercise
-
so
that
the
subjectivity
of
the
assessor
's
decision
be
take
out
of
the
equation
and
there
be
standardisation
,
thereby
take
stress
for
the
applicant
out
of
the
process
.
I
acknowledge
he
sympathetic
and
consider
response
.
arise
from
it
,
I
be
hopeful
that
some
look
-
back
will
be
take
of
at
least
a
parcel
of
case
where
there
have
be
a
refusal
by
SUSI
and
a
subsequent
awarding
by
the
appeal
board
.
yes
.
thank
you
,
a
Chathaoirligh
.
I
understand
that
the
Order
of
the
House
be
set
out
by
member
by
agreement
.
I
also
understand
that
you
have
a
difficult
job
to
do
,
a
Chathaoirligh
,
in
try
to
chair
this
proceedings
.
I
further
understand
that
everybody
who
want
to
speak
be
allocate
time
.
if
we
be
to
act
in
consort
and
to
obey
the
rule
,
then
people
might
afford
I
the
time
that
have
be
allocate
to
I
and
my
party
.
I
will
take
the
ten
minute
.
I
welcome
the
debate
on
this
Bill
.
I
welcome
that
people
be
exercise
about
it
.
I
welcome
the
fact
there
be
a
majority
consensus
around
the
Bill
.
that
be
what
this
House
be
about
-
hear
voice
that
be
against
and
for
a
proposition
.
however
,
each
and
every
one
of
we
be
entitle
to
promulgate
legislation
and
we
be
entitle
to
be
hear
.
I
understand
the
argy
-
bargy
that
happen
,
but
it
sometimes
get
a
bit
much
.
sometimes
,
it
be
a
bit
ridiculous
.
to
deputy
Duncan
Smith
's
credit
,
he
set
out
a
explanatory
memorandum
when
he
be
draft
this
Bill
.
it
read
,
"
there
be
increase
awareness
of
the
need
to
make
inform
consumer
choice
base
on
the
environmental
impact
of
goods
-
they
'
carbon
footprint
'
.
"
we
can
argue
about
the
language
of
what
constitute
a
carbon
footprint
and
who
design
that
language
in
the
first
instance
,
but
the
concept
of
a
carbon
footprint
be
broadly
accept
.
the
memorandum
continue
,
"
some
company
have
introduce
they
own
labelling
system
show
,
for
example
,
the
quantity
of
greenhouse
gas
emit
in
the
process
of
manufacturing
and
shipping
product
to
consumer
.
"
we
can
all
accept
the
fact
there
be
such
thing
as
global
warming
and
greenhouse
gas
emission
.
if
we
accept
that
fundamental
principle
,
then
we
be
off
to
a
good
start
.
some
may
not
accept
they
,
and
that
be
they
entitlement
.
the
memorandum
continue
:
a
full
carbon
inventory
will
attempt
to
itemise
all
greenhouse
gas
emission
release
throughout
the
product
life
-
cycle
,
from
the
extraction
of
raw
material
through
to
the
product
's
manufacture
,
distribution
,
use
and
eventual
disposal
.
however
,
while
many
consumer
be
willing
to
make
more
sustainable
choice
,
they
face
difficulty
.
for
a
sustainable
purchase
choice
to
become
easy
,
consumer
need
good
information
.
currently
,
there
be
no
commonly
use
and
accept
standard
on
how
to
calculate
or
communicate
a
product
's
carbon
footprint
to
consumer
.
this
be
all
that
the
Bill
seek
to
do
.
we
recognise
and
openly
acknowledge
,
as
do
deputy
Smith
,
the
person
who
write
the
legislation
,
that
this
present
enormous
challenge
for
every
stakeholder
involve
.
regardless
of
where
someone
be
in
the
economy
and
society
,
be
he
or
she
a
farmer
in
north
Cork
,
the
chief
executive
of
a
global
multinational
like
Nestlé
or
the
producer
of
a
sub-supply
part
for
the
aeronautical
sector
in
Shannon
,
it
present
a
major
challenge
.
all
we
be
try
to
do
in
promulgate
this
legislation
-
we
accept
the
government
's
amendment
-
be
to
acknowledge
that
consumer
want
to
make
inform
decision
.
no
one
who
introduce
a
private
Member
's
Bill
profess
to
have
the
wisdom
of
Solomon
when
write
it
.
we
write
we
bill
in
the
expectation
they
can
get
to
committee
stage
to
be
amend
as
need
be
.
we
accept
this
Bill
be
not
a
perfect
document
,
but
it
can
be
make
perfect
if
it
be
give
a
chance
to
proceed
.
we
be
not
entirely
happy
that
the
government
be
seek
a
year
to
do
that
-
I
contend
that
a
year
be
a
long
time
,
but
we
accept
it
on
the
basis
of
the
argument
that
have
be
propose
by
two
minister
of
State
in
respect
of
the
amendment
.
if
I
interpret
they
correctly
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
Deputy
Ossian
Smyth
and
Troy
,
have
state
we
cannot
move
ahead
of
the
EU
because
of
single
market
and
harmonisation
consideration
.
I
understand
the
same
apply
in
the
case
of
the
smoking
ban
and
possibly
the
plastic
bag
levy
-
I
be
unsure
about
the
latter
-
but
we
understand
and
accept
the
principle
.
at
least
we
be
at
a
starting
point
in
a
process
where
there
be
a
acceptance
by
individual
.
I
wish
to
disaggregate
the
principle
of
the
consumer
from
the
principle
of
the
individual
.
we
recognise
that
consumer
be
individual
,
but
people
broadly
have
a
level
of
consciousness
now
about
what
they
be
purchase
and
,
in
use
they
purchase
power
with
they
hard
-
earn
money
,
they
want
to
see
transparency
when
buy
a
product
,
regardless
of
what
that
product
be
,
about
what
its
carbon
footprint
be
.
that
be
not
a
bad
thing
.
rather
,
it
be
inherently
good
.
increasingly
,
we
be
see
behavioural
change
.
we
be
change
we
behaviour
in
we
own
household
in
a
way
that
try
to
contribute
to
the
reduction
of
global
warming
and
cut
greenhouse
gas
emission
.
that
be
all
this
legislation
be
try
to
do
.
if
we
look
at
the
government
's
response
,
what
be
a
little
discomfiting
be
the
fact
we
do
not
have
timeline
for
the
sustainable
product
initiative
or
the
eco
design
directive
,
for
instance
.
neither
do
we
know
how
the
commission
's
2020
circular
economy
action
plan
will
be
promulgate
.
timing
be
important
.
we
do
not
have
time
,
if
that
make
sense
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
partisan
,
but
COP26
be
not
the
end
point
.
rather
,
it
be
the
starting
point
for
the
next
step
forward
.
that
be
why
,
in
introduce
this
legislation
,
we
want
to
maintain
the
momentum
of
what
arise
from
COP26
.
as
such
,
we
be
hopeful
the
timeline
will
be
shorten
and
there
will
be
a
urgency
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
respect
of
its
propose
amendment
.
all
we
be
try
to
do
be
put
in
place
a
framework
.
the
cost
to
small
business
can
be
offset
easily
through
Enterprise
Ireland
,
a
agency
for
which
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Troy
,
have
responsibility
.
we
spend
million
upon
million
of
euro
of
taxpayer
's
money
funding
company
through
Enterprise
Ireland
.
I
know
that
because
I
use
to
sit
where
the
Minister
of
State
be
now
.
I
represent
a
agricultural
community
and
I
speak
,
as
I
be
entitled
to
do
,
for
the
agricultural
community
as
well
.
I
live
in
a
town
that
have
one
of
the
large
milk
processing
plant
in
the
country
.
I
recognise
the
value
of
a
beast
and
of
a
blade
of
grass
as
much
as
the
next
person
.
I
recognise
the
value
of
what
farming
bring
to
this
economy
.
however
,
the
purchaser
of
the
primary
product
,
be
it
a
side
of
beef
,
a
carton
of
milk
,
baby
powder
,
infant
formula
or
yoghurt
,
be
the
Yoplait
,
Nestlé
and
Unilever
and
the
Lidls
,
Aldis
and
other
multiple
,
and
they
be
place
a
downward
pressure
on
the
primary
producer
because
they
be
go
to
start
map
they
carbon
footprint
.
this
will
result
in
the
market
determine
from
whom
inside
the
farm
gate
the
Unilever
,
Nestlé
and
Dairygolds
be
go
to
purchase
.
the
farmer
or
primary
producer
who
have
he
or
she
carbon
footprint
map
will
be
the
person
from
whom
they
will
purchase
.
that
be
the
reality
of
the
market
.
we
have
research
this
extensively
.
through
this
legislation
,
we
be
try
to
give
that
primary
producer
a
fight
chance
so
that
they
can
offset
any
cost
that
they
might
incur
inside
the
farm
gate
.
this
can
easily
be
do
through
Pillar
2
of
the
next
round
of
the
common
agricultural
Policy
,
CAP
,
for
instance
,
by
map
it
into
the
eco
scheme
.
we
can
subsidise
the
effort
of
the
farmer
or
the
cost
of
the
expert
advice
they
might
procure
to
reduce
they
carbon
footprint
.
that
can
be
easily
do
.
it
will
happen
whether
we
like
it
or
not
because
the
consumer
demand
it
,
regardless
of
whether
it
be
do
today
,
tomorrow
or
in
two
or
three
year
'
time
.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
farmer
,
primary
producer
and
small
business
be
give
a
fight
chance
.
we
be
introduce
this
legislation
so
that
we
can
get
this
on
the
agenda
now
and
get
Enterprise
Ireland
,
Teagasc
and
all
the
might
of
the
State
,
through
its
research
and
funding
arm
,
to
support
the
people
who
produce
the
excellent
produce
we
have
in
this
country
and
to
give
they
a
fight
chance
on
this
agenda
.
I
fear
that
if
we
do
not
give
they
a
fighting
chance
,
then
the
likes
of
Unilever
,
Nestlé
,
Lidl
and
Aldi
will
exclude
a
lot
of
the
people
we
be
seek
to
fight
for
.
that
be
why
we
be
introduce
this
Bill
.
we
now
move
to
the
three

Sinn
Féin
.

and
US
Attorney
General
Merrick

?
I
again
thank
the
Deputy
for
they
contribution
.
I
will
note
they
.
in
my
previous
response
,
I
take
the
opportunity
to
outline
the
progress
and
consultation
that
have
take
place
to
this
point
.
it
have
be
a
process
of
progress
and
consultation
,
which
be
important
.
as
I
have
already
outline
,
it
be
a
consultation
with
the
wide
possible
representation
of
stakeholder
through
the
advisory
body
.
that
include
student
and
they
have
be
very
much
part
of
the
process
,
which
continue
tomorrow
.
that
be
right
and
proper
.
it
have
be
the
hallmark
of
progress
to
this
point
for
the
leave
certificate
in
2022
and
equally
so
for
that
in
2020
and
2021
.
I
emphasise
that
I
be
acutely
aware
of
the
disruption
cause
to
student
who
be
take
the
exam
in
2022
.
the
Department
will
continue
to
engage
with
education
stakeholder
to
ensure
the
good
interest
of
all
student
be
at
the
heart
of
all
decision
make
relate
to
the
leave
certificate
in
2022
.
there
be
ongoing
engagement
in
plan
prior
to
the
return
to
school
when
plan
be
put
in
place
for
accommodation
to
exam
paper
.
as
I
outline
early
,
other
accommodation
such
as
second
sitting
of
exam
and
the
provision
of
exam
at
Easter
outside
of
school
time
will
be
make
.
there
will
be
a
further
opportunity
tomorrow
to
hear
all
voice
and
opinion
at
the
advisory
group
meeting
in
what
have
always
be
a
open
and
constructive
manner
.
a
opportunity
will
be
afford
to
each
of
the
stakeholder
tomorrow
to
articulate
they
view
,
experience
and
representative
thought
and
idea
on
the
next
stage
of
development
for
the
process
.
I
look
forward
to
that
opportunity
.
I
have
always
support
the
opportunity
for
the
wide
possible
stakeholder
engagement
,
include
with
student
,
and
I
will
continue
to
do
that
.
it
be
a
proper
process
and
it
be
right
and
proper
that
that
opportunity
be
facilitate
tomorrow
.
now
we
be
back
.
I
offer
my
condolence
to
the
family
of
Ashling
Murphy
.
there
be
no
adequate
word
of
comfort
that
I
can
provide
except
to
say
that
we
be
think
of
she
and
she
family
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
remember
a
young
woman
call
Karen
Buckley
.
Karen
be
murder
in
Scotland
in
April
2015
.
she
be
a
postgraduate
occupational
therapy
student
from
Mourneabbey
,
Mallow
,
County
Cork
.
I
do
not
want
we
to
forget
about
Karen
;
I
want
we
to
remember
she
as
a
person
of
great
character
and
intelligence
and
as
a
warm
and
caring
person
.
we
thought
go
out
to
Karen
's
parent
,
John
and
Marian
,
and
she
brother
and
wide
family
as
we
approach
the
sixth
anniversary
of
she
death
.
it
be
important
that
we
remember
Karen
and
Ashling
,
what
they
family
have
lose
and
what
we
as
a
community
have
lose
through
they
absence
.
the
common
thread
that
bind
Karen
to
Ashling
be
the
great
love
that
they
family
have
for
they
and
they
for
they
family
.
they
be
both
young
woman
,
forge
career
path
in
profession
that
be
by
they

if
there
be
one
practical
measure
that
people
in

I
be
share
time
with
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
be
quite
tell
,
not
least
when
he
state
,
''
this
be
what
underpin
we
assessment
that
the
current
very
high
rate
of
inflation
be
temporary
and
that
it
will
begin
to
ease
from
the
second
quarter
of
this
year
.
''
we
all
read
the
economic
report
from
the
likes
of
the
economic
and
social
Research
Institute
and
we
be
all
well
verse
on
economic
affair
at
this
stage
.
I
think
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
signal
to
the
House
in
response
to
the
motion
be
that
,
by
and
large
,
the
government
be
hopeful
everything
will
return
to
some
degree
of
normality
,
as
will
the
2.5
%
of
that
5.7
%
increase
attribute
to
the
cost
of
energy
,
but
the
cost
of
energy
run
through
everything
we
do
in
society
.
whether
we
be
buy
a
packet
of
biscuit
or
pasta
,
fuell
we
car
or
heat
we
house
,
it
run
through
everything
we
do
.
I
believe
the
Minister
of
State
's
contribution
be
signal
to
the
House
that
the
government
be
go
to
be
largely
non-interventionist
in
how
it
approach
the
cost
-
of
-
living
increase
.
it
be
hopeful
,
on
a
wing
and
a
prayer
,
that
cost
will
decrease
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
and
,
therefore
,
it
will
not
do
a
whole
pile
about
it
.
that
be
unfortunate
.
at
a
time
when
people
expect
a
response
from
,
and
intervention
by
,
the
government
,
the
response
from
the
Minister
of
State
and
the
government
be
unfortunate
.
there
be
something
discomfite
about
hear
the
traffic
report
from
aa
Roadwatch
on
"
Morning
Ireland
"
early
.
the
tailback
and
delay
at
the
usual
junction
leave
one
with
a
sense
that
the
gain
in
respect
of
quality
of
life
derive
from
people
be
able
to
work
from
home
be
evaporate
before
we
very
eye
.
I
hope
we
will
not
squander
that
gain
on
quality
of
life
and
I
hope
the
considerable
financial
savings
people
have
make
by
work
remotely
will
not
be
wipe
out
by
rise
fuel
cost
,
in
particular
for
that
commuter
stuck
on
major
orbital
route
around
city
such
as
Dublin
,
Cork
and
Limerick
and
many
town
I
could
mention
.
the
Minister
of
State
make
reference
to
the
annual
rate
of
inflation
and
we
all
acknowledge
the
increase
,
which
be
at
a
all
-
time
high
.
even
so
,
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
gain
worker
have
make
from
not
have
to
spend
hour
in
the
car
will
be
wipe
out
by
the
exorbitant
cost
of
petrol
and
diesel
.
there
be
a
opportunity
to
address
the
cost
-
of
-
living
crisis
.
the
Taoiseach
inform
the
House
yesterday
that
he
believe
increase
wage
be
not
the
answer
because
of
what
he
believe
be
the
danger
of
a
wage
price
spiral
lead
to
high
inflation
,
and
the
Minister
of
State
refer
to
the
same
dynamic
.
I
do
not
know
whether
that
be
government
policy
,
give
the
Tánaiste
be
ask
the
private
sector
after
this
week
's
cabinet
meeting
to
increase
wage
.
he
state
,
''
where
employer
can
afford
pay
increase
,
they
should
do
so
.
''
that
be
typical
of
the
mix
messaging
of
the
government
and
its
inability
to
deliver
one
coherent
message
.
the
people
be
listen
closely
to
message
from
the
government
.
incoherence
lead
only
to
further
anxiety
and
this
need
to
be
address
.
the
Taoiseach
do
not
offer
solution
yesterday
when
respond
to
deputy
Kelly
's
raising
of
the
issue
of
spiral
cost
across
the
range
of
goods
and
service
.
through
this
motion
,
we
have
put
forward
some
solution
.
one
such
measure
the
government
could
consider
to
address
the
spiral
cost
of
energy
would
be
to
actively
wide
access
to
the
fuel
allowance
for
household
that
be
fuel
-
impoverished
.
a
low
-
income
household
would
benefit
greatly
from
a
refundable
carbon
tax
credit
and
this
would
signal
a
clear
transfer
from
the
rich
in
society
to
the
poor
work
family
.
another
solution
would
be
to
provide
increase
in
social
protection
payment
that
would
keep
pace
with
the
rate
of
inflation
,
something
that
be
not
do
in
the
most
recent
budget
,
with
a
long
-
term
commitment
to
bring
up
weekly
rate
to
the
minimum
essential
standard
of
living
.
I
do
not
know
whether
Fianna
Fáil
backbencher
be
listen
to
what
business
be
tell
they
at
present
.
I
speak
with
a
primary
producer
in
the
agri
-food
sector
on
Monday
,
who
inform
I
he
monthly
gas
bill
have
increase
from
€
10000
to
€
36000
over
recent
month
.
this
be
really
bite
in
both
rural
and
urban
Ireland
and
it
be
have
a
major
detrimental
effect
on
business
's
ability
to
continue
to
employ
people
,
as
be
highlight
by
deputy
Nash
.
it
be
begin
to
squeeze
the
ability
of
employer
to
employ
people
in
the
economy
,
and
that
have
to
be
take
note
of
.
there
be
two
minute
remain
in
this
slot
.
I
be
anxious
to
allow
deputy
Murnane
O'Connor
to
come
in
and
for
the
Taoiseach
to
respond
.
I
now
call
on
the
Sinn
Féin
Member
,
deputy
McDonald
.
I
understand
she
be
share
time
with
deputy
John
Brady
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
relate
to
the
motion
concern
the
cost
of
living
.
on
Wednesday

26

"

,

take
now
.
I
will
be
brief
.
firstly
,
I
support
the
amendment
.
it
be
a
laudable
one
and
worthy
of
support
.
certainly
,
the
Labour
Party
seek
to
speak
in
support
of
the
amendment
.
when
the
climate
action
Bill
be
before
we
we
seek
to
put
forward
amendment
to
provide
for
specific
sectoral
target
for
afforestation
.
the
Minister
for
the
environment
,
Climate
and
Communication
refuse
to
accept
that
amendment
.
it
be
disappointing
to
say
the
least
.
we
think
it
would
have
be
quite
a
obvious
thing
for
the
minister
,
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
,
to
take
on
board
give
the
pronouncement
from
that
part
of
government
on
the
desire
to
ensure
we
reach
afforestation
target
throughout
the
State
.
I
welcome
,
therefore
,
this
approach
by
Sinn
Féin
which
merely
ask
the
minister
to
lay
a
report
before
Dáil
Éireann
on
the
level
of
afforestation
per
LEA
.
it
be
a
reasonable
amendment
.
when
you
look
at
the
forestry
licensing
dashboard
,
which
have
become
the
tool
we
all
use
for
information
on
the
number
of
afforestation
licence
and
felling
licence
issue
,
we
can
clearly
see
that
while
there
be
a
increase
in
September
,
October
and
November
,
there
be
a
reduction
of
December
.
obviously
,
January
's
figure
have
yet
to
be
publish
.
it
seem
to
I
that
when
you
parse
the
afforestation
licence
that
have
be
grant
,
small
farmer
or
private
landowner
-
mainly
farmer
-
receive
about
26
felling
licence
.
the
vast
bulk
of
they
be
go
to
Coillte
.
it
receive
almost
double
that
amount
,
at
51
licence
and
that
be
a
constant
trend
.
what
I
be
ask
the
minister
to
do
,
in
support
this
amendment
,
be
to
use
he
good
office
to
start
ensure
that
where
planting
licence
,
or
even
felling
licence
-
as
there
be
a
natural
rate
of
felling
as
well
-
be
be
apply
for
,
that
he
remove
the
impediment
to
that
.
there
be
still
too
many
.
I
be
find
that
where
felling
licence
be
be
apply
,
small
farmer
who
own
tract
of
forestry
be
feel
a
inordinate
amount
of
stress
and
strain
in
respect
of
the
process
they
must
go
through
and
the
hoop
they
must
jump
.
they
be
not
rich
people
.
they
be
people
who
plant
in
good
faith
.
they
be
people
who
seek
to
look
to
the
future
.
they
be
people
who
want
to
grow
tree
again
and
reapply
for
afforestation
licence
.
however
,
the
system
still
have
not
work
through
the
issue
that
have
be
so
well
highlight
by
the
agriculture
committee
under
the
chairmanship
of
deputy
Cahill
.
we
be
not
see
enough
of
a
seismic
shift
to
reach
that
afforestation
target
the
government
itself
have
set
.
this
amendment
be
a
very
sensible
one
.
if
the
minister
could
meet
its
proposer
on
this
and
support
the
amendment
it
would
give
we
a
great
degree
of
transparency
and
move
towards
the
setting
of
the
clear
target
that
be
badly
need
if
we
be
to
meet
we
sequestration
goal
,
carbon
reduction
goal
and
all
the
self
-
evident
goal
I
need
not
explain
.
there
be
a
real
willingness
and
desire
now
by
forestry
owner
to
plant
but
there
be
still
too
much
of
a
weighting
against
they
in
term
of
the
bureaucracy
and
the
technocratic
mechanism
that
be
in
place
and
it
be
prevent
that
from
happen
.
if
they
can
be
work
through
it
would
assist
the
process
greatly
.
specificity
be
precisely
what
should
be
govern
primary
legislation
.
this
be
a
specific
amendment
.
it
should
not
be
so
injurious
to
the
minister
that
he
should
not
accept
it
on
the
basis
that
it
be
overly
specific
.
there
be
a
point
to
be
make
here
that
capture
the
political
Zeitgeist
.
that
be
about
how
we
take
carbon
out
of
society
and
the
economy
.
one
of
the
way
to
do
that
be
through
a
active
afforestation
programme
.
the
fact
in
respect
of
the
dashboard
,
which
be
the
toolkit
we
all
use
,
clearly
indicate
that
that
target
will
not
be
meet
.
deputy
Carthy
have
already
state
that
.
we
can
see
it
for
ourselves
.
the
point
of
the
amendment
be
that
it
ask
for
a
level
of
granularity
which
be
not
unreasonable
.
the
Department
be
a
mighty
Department
in
the
sense
that
it
have
many
personnel
.
it
have
a
ever
-
grow
number
of
personnel
,
particularly
relate
to
the
processing
of
afforestation
and
felling
licence
.
it
have
many
expert
now
.
it
would
be
very
easy
for
the
Department
to
carry
out
this
exercise
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
rethink
he
position
.
I
fear
I
be
involved
in
a
futile
exercise
in
that
regard
but
I
ask
that
nonetheless
.
I
rise
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
to
support
the
amendment
.
reference
have
be
make
to
the
former
deputy
and
former
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
,
Pat
the
cope
Gallagher
,
who
hold
the
respect
of
every
single
person
in
this
House
,
both
past
and
present
.
he
speak
with
passion
in
respect
of
SI
89
of
2019
.
he
argue
that
natural
justice
must
be
allow
to
occur
and
that
common
law
rights
should
be
upheld
.
what
be
at
issue
in
this
group
of
amendment
be
the
very
principle
espouse
by
former
deputy
Gallagher
,
who
represent
a
coastal
community
,
who
be
very
close
to
the
fishing
sector
for
so
many
year
and
who
know
it
intimately
.
he
serve
as
a
guide
to
many
of
we
who
be
not
so
well
verse
in
matter
relate
to
the
sector
.
we
be
support
this
amendment
,
quite
frankly
,
because
we
believe
that
the
long
-
establish
principle
in
common
law
of
beyond
reasonable
doubt
should
be
inculcate
into
this
legislation
.
it
be
as
simple
as
that
.
other
speaker
before
I
and
the
proposer
of
the
amendment
have
articulate
that
viewpoint
very
well
.
we
be
debate
this
legislation
in
the
context
of
the
recent
prospect
of
Russian
naval
exercise
take
place
within
we
exclusive
economic
zone
.
the
prospect
of
that
exercise
highlight
and
expose
the
weakness
in
we
defence
force
in
term
of
fishery
patrol
and
the
weakness
inherent
in
we
own
fishery
sector
.
the
idea
that
there
would
be
,
just
yesterday
,
a
European
Fishery
Control
Agency
,
EFCA
,
vessel
dock
in
Cobh
be
anathema
to
that
of
we
who
have
great
respect
for
we
Defence
force
and
specifically
for
we
navy
.
we
now
know
that
the
capacity
of
the
navy
to
patrol
we
own
water
be
just
not
there
.
the
timing
of
this
legislation
be
all
wrong
.
when
I
think
of
the
diplomatic
win
,
a
win
that
be
not
garner
by
the
government
or
any
Department
of
State
but
by
fisher
who
take
on
the
might
of
a
empire
,
I
be
remind
of
the
Skibbereen
Eagle
take
on
the
might
of
the
Tsar
of
Russia
.
there
be
a
certain
symbolism
in
that
,
in
the
way
that
people
like
Patrick
Murphy
and
Brendan
Byrne
take
on
the
might
of
the
Russian
navy
.
it
make
I
proud
to
be
Irish
,
that
this
humble
people
be
defend
not
only
the
rights
of
fisher
but
also
defend
the
environment
and
the
sustainability
of
the
sector
that
they
represent
.
they
be
represent
family
and
individual
who
seek
to
ply
they
trade
,
make
that
catch
and
make
the
few
shilling
to
keep
life
and
soul
together
.
it
be
a
fantastic
example
of
David
and
Goliath
.
the
minister
be
propose
legislation
that
seek
to
further
trammel
the
rights
of
that
very
same
people
.
if
I
be
advise
the
minister
,
with
the
minister
himself
have
take
such
a
strident
view
on
this
very
legislation
when
he
be
in
opposition
,
I
would
ask
he
to
roll
back
a
little
on
it
,
to
take
further
counsel
and
not
to
go
down
this
route
in
regard
to
the
legislation
.
this
be
precisely
because
,
as
be
articulate
in
pre-legislative
scrutiny
,
the
issue
of
reasonable
doubt
,
which
be
a
concept
that
prevail
in
the
common
law
system
,
be
not
present
here
.
while
support
this
amendment
,
I
fear
we
be
go
to
criminalise
further
ordinary
man
and
woman
.
it
be
the
State
lean
too
heavily
on
ordinary
man
and
woman
.
the
minister
need
to
revise
he
position
on
this
.
in
response
to
the
minister
,
I
appreciate
the
point
that
this
be
a
administrative
scheme
and
that
the
concept
of
the
balance
of
probability
be
apply
.
I
remain
open
to
the
expertise
of
the
minister
's
own
official
,
give
that
they
have
spend
much
time
go
to
and
from
Brussels
over
the
year
.
be
due
cognisance
take
of
the
fact
that
we
be
in
a
common
law
system
?
whether
or
not
there
be
a
criminal
sanction
for
the
application
of
a
penalty
point
system
,
fisher
feel
put
upon
,
whether
through
decommissioning
scheme
or
the
outworking
of
negotiation
at
intergovernmental
level
in
respect
of
Britain
's
exit
from
the
European
Union
.
there
be
frustration
on
the
part
of
fisher
that
they
be
get
a
small
and
small
part
of
the
pot
with
every
successive
negotiation
.
do
the
minister
acknowledge
the
frustration
of
the
Opposition
as
it
seek
to
introduce
amendment
of
this
nature
?
it
be
try
to
ensure
that
if
a
penalty
point
system
be
introduce
,
it
do
not
further
impose
upon
the
fisher
and
they
be
not
put
upon
.
can
the
minister
understand
where
fisher
be
come
from
?
they
feel
as
if
there
be
a
slow
and
gradual
erosion
of
they
livelihood
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
too
rhetorical
about
it
.
in
the
language
of
law
,
this
be
a
administrative
scheme
,
with
a
penalty
point
system
,
but
fisherman
perceive
it
-----
-----
and
want
they
feeling
to
be
acknowledge
that
they
perceive
it
as
be
yet
another
heavy
-
hand
state
intervention
.
if
this
legislation
be
about
a
EU
harmonisation
of
sanction
,
be
the
30
day
the
de
facto
position
across
all
member
state
?
be
each
member
state
implement
a
30
-
day
regime
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
so
be
it
;
there
be
consistency
.
however
,
we
plead
mitigation
in
this
circumstance
.
give
the
particular
variation
in
a
Irish
scenario
where
fisherman
be
fishing
quite
far
from
they
home
base
,
as
have
be
articulate
by
deputy
Pringle
,
there
be
scope
to
plead
for
some
mitigation
to
allow
for
a
great
number
of
day
to
be
provide
when
prepare
one
's
case
,
as
it
be
.
that
be
simply
what
the
amendment
seek
to
do
.
be
the
government
tie
to
the
30
day
so
as
to
be
ad
idem
with
the
position
of
other
member
states
or
do
the
government
have
scope
in
how
it
transpose
the
EU
rule
?
I
ask
the
Minister
a
specific
question
so
as
to
seek
enlightenment
on
the
justification
for
the
30
day
and
he
have
come
back
to
we
on
that
.
I
ask
specifically
whether
that
be
consistent
with
other
member
state
's
position
in
respect
of
prepare
case
and
whether
there
be
scope
,
because
of
the
particular
condition
that
exist
in
a
Irish
context
,
for
a
moving
of
that
beyond
the
30
day
.
it
be
really
more
from
the
point
of
view
of
seek
information
that
I
pose
the
question
.
I
just
want
to
see
what
the
member
state
's
position
be
in
respect
of
the
30
day
.
be
there
great
scope
for
furtherance
of
that
position
?

I
raise
this
issue
because
I
be
extremely
concerned
that
the
Department
be
now
pull
back
community
welfare
service
where
they
be
deliver
in
face
-
to
-
face
setting
in
the
most
local
of
centre
,
particularly
in
rural
area
.
base
on
what
I
have
hear
so
far
,
my
fear
be
that
the
minister
be
not
renew
any
lease
that
she
Department
may
have
have
with
the
HSE
for
the
delivery
of
this
service
in
what
be
call
traditional
dispensary
or
health
centre
.
what
be
the
minister
's
position
on
this
matter
?
I
be
try
to
listen
carefully
to
the
language
of
the
minister
's
reply
.
I
be
not
reassure
by
it
.
the
premise
on
which
I
base
my
question
be
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
interact
face
to
face
with
a
officer
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
for
clarification
because
I
be
hear
that
she
Department
be
not
renew
lease
in
respect
of
certain
traditional
centre
such
as
health
centre
which
deliver
in
community
and
in
the
most
rural
area
.
be
that
the
case
?
all
Deputy
represent
the
poor
and
the
most
vulnerable
.
we
accept
the
fact
that
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
system
be
a
excellent
system
because
it
deliver
to
the
poor
.
we
know
that
the
minister
's
Department
give
nearly
€
43
million
in
exceptional
and
urgent
need
payment
in
2021
.
my
fear
now
be
that
for
the
citizen
who
do
not
have
access
to
the
near
town
,
who
traditionally
might
have
have
access
in
the
local
village
where
there
be
a
visit
community
welfare
officer
in
the
local
health
centre
,
that
system
will
stop
.
if
that
stop
it
just
take
the
citizen
that
bit
further
away
from
the
service
.
again
I
ask
the
minister
if
it
be
she
Department
's
intention
not
to
renew
lease
with
the
HSE
.
it
be
one
department
renew
with
a
government
agency
like
the
HSE
,
State
to
State
.
be
it
factually
the
case
that
the
minister
be
not
renew
that
lease
with
the
HSE
in
respect
of
the
delivery
of
service
in
certain
centre
around
the
country
?

Murchú

enough
time

give
the
deputy
a
opportunity

speaker
have

I
call

Ó
Murchú

I
move

my
question
be
more
thematic
in
the
sense
that
we
be
focus
heavily
now
on
afforestation
target
and
the
toolkit
that
be
the
dashboard
.
it
have
become
the
tool
everybody
now
use
as
the
benchmark
for
progress
on
afforestation
target
.
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
and
the
cost
of
input
be
allude
to
early
and
concern
around
fertiliser
be
also
wrap
up
in
this
question
.
have
the
minister
now
abandon
the
afforestation
target
of
8,000
ha
per
year
?
that
be
ultimately
the
question
I
wish
to
hear
answer
.
that
be
bind
up
in
the
specific
question
I
have
ask
.
I
invite
the
Minister
of
State
to
give
we
she
personal
perspective
on
afforestation
.
I
would
be
delighted
to
hear
it
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
she
answer
.
the
announcement
of
a
target
of
1040
licence
for
2022

to
I
that
the

service
have
abandon

would
result
in
the
planning
of
only
4000
ha
.
I
be
not
convinced
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
be
,
that
all
of
the
stakeholder
through
Project
Woodland
be
as
enthusiastic
about
the
future
of
forestry
policy
.
I
think
some
of
that
stakeholder
be
become
increasingly
frustrated
by
the
lack
of
ambition
.
I
would
certainly
like
to
work
with
the
Minister
of
State
to
see
how
we
can
be
more
ambitious
in
attain
and
achieve
that
target
,
precisely
for
the
reason
she
have
outline
in
respect
of
carbon
sequestration
and
a
proper
policy
intervention
.
I
put
it
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
however
,
that
the
lack
of
ambition
here
be
disappointing
.
I
mean
that
genuinely
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
Minister
of
State
be
extremely
genuine
in
what
she
seek
to
achieve
.
there
be
no
doubt
about
that
in
my
mind
.
dire
I
suggest
,
respectfully
,
there
be
a
level
of
granularity
that
need
to
be
work
through
.
that
must
be
acknowledge
.
the
minister
of
State
say
the
Department
will
reach
the
8,000
ha
target
this
year
.
that
remain
to
be
see
.
I
suggest
respectfully
that
the
stakeholder
be
not
see
the
reality
of
that
in
the
issuance
of
new
afforestation
licence
.
the
proof
of
that
be
in
the
toolkit
,
which
be
the
dashboard
.
the
aspiration
might
be
there
but
the
evidence
of
the
practical
outworking
of
reach
the
afforestation
target
be
not
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
indeed
all
Deputy
who
come
and
participate
in
this
debate
.
I
greatly
appreciate
they
interest
,
support
and
contribution
.
I
especially
thank
they
for
the
personal
reflection
they
bring
to
the
House
.
to
reflect
on
one
's
own
experience
be
not
always
a
easy
thing
to
do
,
particularly
in
a
forum
like
this
,
but
it
do
help
tell
that
story
about
why
it
be
important
.
we
tell
the
story
of
we
constituent
,
but
to
advance
and
evolve
we
democracy
it
be
important
to
sometimes
reflect
on
the
personal
experience
we
have
have
.
there
be
absolutely
no
point
in
come
in
,
pull
up
the
ladder
and
pretend
it
be
easy
to
be
here
when
it
be
not
.
we
need
to
be
honest
with
people
and
say
we
do
it
,
we
see
this
issue
,
we
face
the
challenge
,
we
get
on
and
we
try
to
fix
they
but
we
do
it
anyway
and
they
can
too
.
this
be
all
about
try
to
bring
more
people
into
this
chamber
,
try
to
be
more
inclusive
and
reach
out
further
and
further
.
we
have
have
a
very
good
parliamentary
structure
that
have
serve
we
extremely
well
but
we
democracy
be
essentially
always
incomplete
.
there
be
always
more
to
do
and
more
that
can
be
improve
upon
.
it
be
naturally
incomplete
if
half
the
population
be
not
represent
here
in
a
reasonable
way
over
time
.
that
have
never
be
the
case
and
we
need
to
take
the
step
we
can
to
get
to
that
point
.
democracy
,
and
we
institution
of
democracy
,
must
keep
pace
with
we
need
to
reflect
the
will
of
we
people
and
the
thing
that
be
important
to
they
.
where
we
find
barrier
we
must
take
step
to
try
to
address
they
.
this
be
simply
a
effort
to
do
that
.
I
recognise
how
complex
it
be
.
I
recognise
the
read
-
across
constitutionally
.
I
recognise
the
academic
debate
around
it
,
that
be
,
whether
it
be
necessary
,
the
read
-
across
on
the
question
of
parliamentary
privilege
and
how
that
be
link
.
deputy
Howlin
also
mention
that
to
I
.
it
be
,
of
course
,
part
of
the
same
conversation
.
my
effort
be
to
try
to
begin
to
tackle
that
initial
barrier
and
ask
what
be
it
,
at
its
core
,
that
we
must
be
here
for
that
be
perhaps
a
barrier
to
maternity
,
paternity
and
sick
leave
.
the
answer
be
,
of
course
,
voting
.
I
hope
nobody
would
take
from
this
that
I
do
not
see
it
as
important
to
be
here
.
be
here
and
stand
here
be
the
privilege
of
my
professional
career
.
it
be
so
enjoyable
.
it
be
such
a
privilege
to
be
able
to
participate
,
to
vote
,
to
be
part
of
the
parliamentary
structure
and
to
serve
constituent
.
at
the
same
time
,
I
recognise
that
for
the
institution
to
evolve
and
become
strong
and
good
and
for
more
people
to
come
easily
into
that
structure
they
must
be
question
,
challenge
and
help
to
evolve
as
time
go
on
.
as
the
Minister
of
State
,
Deputy
Bacik
,
Ó
Snodaigh
and
other
have
say
,
this
thing
must
happen
together
.
there
be
a
confluence
of
event
at
the
moment
that
require
,
as
Dr.
Catherine
Day
say
at
the
citizen
's
assembly
,
real
seismic
change
around
some
of
this
issue
.
there
be
that
opportunity
but
only
if
we
take
that
point
and
run
with
they
.
I
note
what
deputy
Richmond
mention
about
the
poll
on
thejournal
.ie
,
which
be
interesting
.
of
course
,
it
be
easy
to
give
a
quick
reaction
to
something
like
that
,
such
as
a
quick
question
on
whether
you
be
in
favour
of
or
against
something
.
the
deputy
be
talk
about
some
of
the
comment
on
it
.
it
be
hard
to
see
some
of
that
and
think
people
might
believe
we
do
not
really
want
to
do
the
work
or
that
we
be
not
very
happy
to
be
here
.
of
course
we
be
.
it
be
not
about
make
life
easy
for
politician
.
it
be
about
open
up
the
Parliament
to
more
people
and
make
it
easy
for
they
to
be
here
.
it
be
about
open
up
rather
than
try
to
protect
or
serve
ourselves
.
we
have
have
separate
conversation
about
the
need
for
more
female
representation
and
very
strong
debate
on
that
to
the
effect
that
there
must
be
more
woman
in
politics
and
that
woman
in
politics
must
be
facilitate
,
and
there
be
the
debate
around
the
minister
,
deputy
McEntee
,
and
the
particular
challenge
she
face
as
a
cabinet
minister
.
that
be
all
very
well
but
when
one
bring
this
measure
to
try
to
realise
some
of
that
ambition
,
and
indeed
when
they
be
bring
forward
by
woman
such
as
myself
or
deputy
Bacik
as
part
of
the
committee
or
Dr.
Day
as
part
of
the
assembly
,
rationally
,
it
be
important
that
be
support
or
at
least
discuss
in
a
serious
way
as
step
.
that
be
the
debate
we
have
have
here
.
I
greatly
welcome
it
.
it
be
a
genuinely
positive
debate
about
a
effort
to
be
constructive
.
we
will
see
how
we
can
take
it
forward
through
committee
stage
.
there
be
more
debate
to
be
have
about
the
wording
.
I
understand
the
complexity
of
that
,
include
the
concern
around
the
Attorney
General
and
the
read
-
across
about
other
issue
.
that
be
debate
we
can
have
and
be
open
to
have
.
I

that
I
do
not
see
it

.
be
here
and
stand
here
be
the
privilege
of
my
professional
career
.
it
be
so
enjoyable
.
it
be
such
a
privilege
to
be
able
to
participate
,
to
vote
,
to
be
part
of
the
parliamentary
structure
and
to
serve
constituent
.
at
the

time
,
I
recognise
that
for
the
institution
to
evolve
and
become
strong
and
good
and
for
more
people
to
come
easily
into
that
structure
they
must
be
question
,
challenge

help
to
evolve
as

go
on
.
as
the
Minister
of
State
,
Deputy
Bacik
,
Ó
Snodaigh
and
other
have
say
,
this
thing
must
happen
together
.
there
be
a
confluence
of
event
at
the
moment
that
require
,
as
Dr.
Catherine

say
at
the
citizen
's
assembly
,
real
seismic
change
around
some
of
this
issue
.
there
be
that
opportunity
but
only
if
we
take
that
point
and
run
with
they
.
I
note
what
deputy
Richmond
mention
about
the
poll
on
thejournal
.ie
,
which
be
interesting
.
of
course
,
it
be
easy
to
give
a
quick

to
something
like
that
,
such
as
a
quick
question
on
whether
you
be
in
favour
of
or
against
something
.
the
deputy
be
talk
about
some
of
the
comment
on
it
.
it
be
hard
to
see
some
of
that
and
think
people
might
believe
we
do
not
really
want
to
do
the
work
or
that
we
be
not
very
happy
to
be
here
.
of
course
we
be
.
it
be
not
about
make
life
easy
for
politician
.
it
be
about
open
up
the
Parliament
to
more
people
and
make
it
easy
for
they
to
be
here
.
it
be
about
open
up
rather
than
try
to
protect
or
serve
ourselves
.
we
have
have
separate
conversation
about
the
need
for
more
female
representation
and
very
strong
debate
on
that
to
the
effect
that
there
must
be
more
woman
in
politics
and
that
woman
in
politics
must
be
facilitate
,
and
there
be
the
debate
around
the
minister
,
deputy
McEntee
,
and
the
particular
challenge
she
face
as
a
cabinet
minister
.
that
be
all
very
well
but
when
one
bring
this
measure
to
try
to
realise
some
of
that
ambition
,
and
indeed
when
they
be
bring
forward
by
woman
such
as
myself
or
deputy
Bacik
as
part
of
the
committee
or
Dr.
Day
as
part
of
the
assembly
,
rationally
,
it
be
important
that
be
support
or
at
least
discuss
in
a
serious
way
as
step
.
that
be
the
debate
we
have
have
here
.
I
greatly
welcome
it
.
it
be
a
genuinely
positive
debate
about
a
effort
to
be
constructive
.
we
will
see
how
we
can
take
it
forward
through
committee
stage
.
there
be
more
debate
to
be
have
about
the
wording
.
I
understand
the
complexity
of
that
,
include
the
concern
around
the
Attorney
General
and
the
read
-
across
about
other
issue
.
that
be
debate
we
can
have
and
be
open
to
have
.
I
thank

facilitate
the

,
for
participate

for
be

encouraging

they

I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
indeed
all
Deputy
who
come
and
participate
in
this
debate
.
I
greatly
appreciate
they
interest
,
support
and
contribution
.
I
especially
thank
they
for
the
personal
reflection
they
bring
to
the
House
.
to
reflect
on
one
's
own
experience
be
not
always
a
easy
thing
to
do
,
particularly
in
a
forum
like
this
,
but
it
do
help
tell
that
story
about
why
it
be
important
.
we
tell
the
story
of
we
constituent
,
but
to
advance
and
evolve
we
democracy
it
be
important
to
sometimes
reflect
on
the
personal
experience
we
have
have
.
there
be
absolutely
no
point
in
come
in
,
pull
up
the
ladder
and
pretend
it
be
easy
to
be
here
when
it
be
not
.
we
need
to
be
honest
with
people
and
say
we
do
it
,
we
see
this
issue
,
we
face
the
challenge
,
we
get
on
and
we
try
to
fix
they
but
we
do
it
anyway
and
they
can
too
.
this
be
all
about
try
to
bring
more
people
into
this
chamber
,
try
to
be
more
inclusive
and
reach
out
further
and
further
.
we
have
have
a
very
good
parliamentary
structure
that
have
serve
we
extremely
well
but
we
democracy
be
essentially
always
incomplete
.
there
be
always
more
to
do
and
more
that
can
be
improve
upon
.
it
be
naturally
incomplete
if
half
the
population
be
not
represent
here
in
a
reasonable
way
over
time
.
that
have
never
be
the
case
and
we
need
to
take
the
step
we
can
to
get
to
that
point
.
democracy
,
and
we
institution
of
democracy
,
must
keep
pace
with
we
need
to
reflect
the
will
of
we
people
and
the
thing
that
be
important
to
they
.
where
we
find
barrier
we
must
take
step
to
try
to
address
they
.
this
be
simply
a
effort
to
do
that
.
I
recognise
how
complex
it
be
.
I
recognise
the
read
-
across
constitutionally
.
I
recognise
the
academic
debate
around
it
,
that
be
,
whether
it
be
necessary
,
the
read
-
across
on
the
question
of
parliamentary
privilege
and
how
that
be
link
.
deputy
Howlin
also
mention
that
to
I
.
it
be
,
of
course
,
part
of
the
same
conversation
.
my
effort
be
to
try
to
begin
to
tackle
that
initial
barrier
and
ask
what
be
it
,
at
its
core
,
that
we
must
be
here
for
that
be
perhaps
a
barrier
to
maternity
,
paternity
and
sick
leave
.
the
answer
be
,
of
course
,
voting
.
I
hope
nobody
would
take
from
this
that
I
do
not
see
it
as

agree
with

whom
I
know
have
serve
time
in
the
Middle
East
,
and
have
be
in
either
UNIFIL

perhaps
both

one
of
the
reason
Irish
people
be
so
knowledgeable

interested
in
this
part

be
because
close
to
50
%
of
we
Defence

have
serve

at
some
point
in

career

that
drive
more
knowledge

a

across
society
in

of
what
continue
to

across
the

in

towards

do
I
believe
a
two

solution
be

possible

yes
,
I
do
.
do
I
believe
that
people
be
actively
look
to
undermine
it
as
week
and
month
go
by
?
yes
,
I
do
.
be
I
worried
about
the
possible
illegality
of
the
recent
announcement
by
the
Israeli
government
on
the
strategic
nature
of
the
late
settlement
expansion
that
be
be
announce
to
essentially
cut
off
Palestinian
community
from
each
other
in
the
context
of
a
future
Palestinian
state
?
yes
,
I
be
worried
about
that
.
yes
,
it
be
illegal
,
and
,
yes
,
I
call
it
out
.
do
I
want
to
engage
with
a
Israeli
government
?
yes
,
I
do
as
well
.
do
I
want
to
work
with
the
Palestinian
Authority
to
create
a
more
credible
political
leadership
across
Palestine
?
yes
,
I
want
to
do
that
too
.
I
have
be
work
with
other
country
to
try
to
help
do
that
,
both
in
the
region
and
in
the
EU
and
elsewhere
.
I
will
continue
to
do
that
.
it
be
my
judgment
that
if
we
isolate
ourselves
by
the
strength
of
language
that
we
use
at
this
stage
,
even
though
we
may
passionately
believe
in
that
,
then
my
job
become
more
difficult
in
try
to
create
that
consensus
.
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
be
correct
that
the
EU
have
respond
in
a
extraordinary
way
to
the
shocking
violence
that
we
be
see
as
war
be
wage
on
Ukraine
from
Russia
.
it
have
be
a
extraordinary
response
.
I
have
never
see
anything
like
it
in
my
23
year
of
politics
link
to
the
Union
.
if
we
could
respond
like
that
to
other
conflict
around
the
world
,
whether
in
Yemen
,
Ethiopia
over
the
past
year
,
Afghanistan
or
Syria
,
that
would
be
a
powerful
thing
.
if
we
could
create
that
kind
of
consensus
,
drive
and
influence
in
the
context
of
encourage
and
push
for
peace
in
the
Middle
East
,
that
would
be
a
powerful
thing
too
,
but
to
achieve
that
,
consensus
have
to
be
achieve
,
or
at
least
partial
consensus
by
build
a
alliance
of
country
that
be
willing
to
push
in
that
direction
.
Ireland
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
impose
sanction
on
its
own
.
Ireland
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
impose
a
arm
embargo
on
its
own
,
not
that
we
sell
arm
anyway
,
but
we
can
create
momentum
around
that
kind
of
activity
by
create
a
narrative
that
be
agree
by
other
country
in
the
EU
.
that
build
momentum
-
the
kind
of
momentum
that
we
have
create
in
the
context
of
the
horror
of
the
war
in
Ukraine
right
now
.
the
approach
that
I
defend
and
take
be
one
of
engagement
with
a
Israeli
government
that
be
highly
diverse
and
that
have
multiple
partner
to
it
,
include
Arab
partner
.
I
have
invest
in
try
to
build
a
relationship
with
the
Israeli
foreign
Minister
,
and
I
make
no
apology
for
that
.
that
be
what
Ireland
should
be
do
as
a
member
of
the
international
community
and
as
a
country
that
want
to
change
Israeli
policy
towards
Palestinian
.
I
will
also
work
with
other
in
a
effort
to
try
to
build
momentum
in
that
space
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
a
country
that
continue
to
support
Palestinian
from
a
humanitarian
perspective
.
I
remain
a
strong
advocate
for
UNRWA
,
as
other
try
to
undermine
its
credibility
as
a
organisation
.
so
far
this
year
,
we
have
commit
€
6
million
to
UNRWA
and
we
may
commit
more
.
I
think
it
be
€9
million
last
year
.
I
see
the
extraordinary
benefit
of
UNRWA
through
education
,
healthcare
,
income
distribution
and
so
on
that
UNRWA
continue
to
provide
.
I
accept
the
strength
of
feeling
and
also
much
of
what
be
outline
in
this
Amnesty
report
.
we
will
study
it
.
we
will
study
the
recommendation
and
conclusion
of
that
report
and
I
expect
we
will
use
it
to
influence
the
approach
that
we
take
towards
try
to
protect
and
encourage
a
peace
process
that
can
deliver
a
two
-
state
solution
,
which
be
absolutely
the
government
's
priority
in
this
debate

deputy
Boyd
Barrett
be
correct
that
the
EU
have
respond
in
a
extraordinary
way
to
the
shocking
violence
that
we
be
see
as
war
be
wage
on
Ukraine
from
Russia
.
it
have
be
a
extraordinary
response
.
I
have
never
see
anything
like
it
in
my
23
year
of
politics
link
to
the
Union
.
if
we
could
respond
like
that
to
other
conflict
around
the
world
,
whether
in
Yemen
,
Ethiopia
over
the
past
year
,
Afghanistan
or
Syria
,
that
would
be
a
powerful
thing
.
if
we
could
create
that
kind
of
consensus
,
drive
and
influence
in
the
context
of
encourage
and
push
for
peace
in
the
Middle
East
,
that
would
be
a
powerful
thing
too
,
but
to
achieve
that
,
consensus
have
to
be
achieve
,
or
at
least
partial
consensus
by
build
a
alliance
of
country
that
be
willing
to
push
in
that
direction
.
Ireland
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
impose
sanction
on
its
own
.
Ireland
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
impose
a
arm
embargo
on
its
own
,
not
that
we
sell
arm
anyway
,
but
we
can
create
momentum
around
that
kind
of
activity
by
create
a
narrative
that
be
agree
by
other
country
in
the
EU
.
that
build
momentum
-
the
kind
of
momentum
that
we
have
create
in
the
context
of
the
horror
of
the
war
in
Ukraine
right
now
.
the
approach
that
I
defend
and
take
be
one
of
engagement
with
a
Israeli
government
that
be
highly
diverse
and
that
have
multiple
partner
to
it
,
include
Arab
partner
.
I
have
invest
in
try
to
build
a
relationship
with
the
Israeli
foreign
Minister
,
and
I
make
no
apology
for
that
.
that
be
what
Ireland
should
be
do
as
a
member
of
the
international
community
and
as
a
country
that
want
to
change
Israeli
policy
towards
Palestinian
.
I
will
also
work
with
other
in
a
effort
to
try
to
build
momentum
in
that
space
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
a
country
that
continue
to
support
Palestinian
from
a
humanitarian
perspective
.
I
remain
a
strong
advocate
for
UNRWA
,
as
other
try
to
undermine
its
credibility
as
a
organisation
.
so
far
this
year
,
we
have
commit
€
6
million
to
UNRWA
and
we
may
commit
more
.
I
think
it
be
€9
million
last
year
.
I
see
the
extraordinary
benefit
of
UNRWA
through
education
,
healthcare
,
income
distribution
and
so
on
that
UNRWA
continue
to
provide
.
I
accept
the
strength
of
feeling
and
also
much
of
what
be
outline
in
this
Amnesty
report
.
we
will
study
it
.
we
will
study
the
recommendation
and
conclusion
of
that
report
and
I
expect
we
will
use
it
to
influence
the
approach
that
we
take
towards
try
to
protect
and
encourage
a
peace
process
that
can
deliver
a
two
-
state
solution
,
which
be
absolutely
the
government
's
priority
in
this
debate
.
we
do
not
do
that
by
speak
in
a
entirely
different
way
from
everybody
else
and
create
a
impression
that
Ireland
be
out
on
its
own
.
that
be
the
difference
in
the
approach
between
I
and
many
of
the
Member
opposite
.
it
be
a
judgment
call
politically
in
how
we
should
approach
that
.
I
agree
with
deputy
Berry
,
whom
I
know
have
serve
time
in
the
Middle
East
,
and
have
be
in
either
UNIFIL
or
UNDOF
,
or
perhaps
both
.
one
of
the
reason
Irish
people
be
so
knowledgeable
and
interested
in
this
part
of
the
world
be
because
close
to
50
%
of
we
Defence
force
have
serve
in
UNIFIL
or
UNDOF
at
some
point
in
they
career
.
that
drive
more
knowledge
and
concern
and
a
sense
of
injustice
across
society
in
term
of
what
continue
to
happen
across
the
Middle
East
,
in
particular
towards
the
Palestinian
.
do
I
believe
a
two
-
state
solution
be
still
possible
?
yes
,
I
do
.
do
I
believe
that
people
be
actively
look
to
undermine
it
as
week
and
month
go
by
?
yes
,
I
do
.
be
I
worried
about
the
possible
illegality
of
the
recent
announcement
by
the
Israeli
government
on
the
strategic
nature
of
the
late
settlement
expansion
that
be
be
announce
to
essentially
cut
off
Palestinian
community
from
each
other
in
the
context
of
a
future
Palestinian
state
?
yes
,
I
be
worried
about
that
.
yes
,
it
be
illegal
,
and
,
yes
,
I
call
it
out
.
do
I
want
to
engage
with
a
Israeli
government
?
yes
,
I
do
as
well
.
do
I
want
to
work
with
the
Palestinian
Authority
to
create
a
more
credible
political
leadership
across
Palestine
?
yes
,
I
want
to
do
that
too
.
I
have
be
work
with
other
country
to
try
to
help
do
that
,
both
in
the
region
and
in
the
EU
and
elsewhere
.
I
will
continue
to
do
that
.
it
be
my
judgment
that
if
we
isolate
ourselves
by
the
strength
of
language
that
we
use
at
this
stage
,
even
though
we
may
passionately
believe
in
that
,
then
my
job
become
more

I
be
share
time
with
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
.
I
welcome
and
will
support
the
motion
.
if
the
government
be
to
read
the
wording
properly
,
it
would
see
it
"
reject
as
inadequate
the
government
proposal
in
the
general
scheme
of
the
right
to
request
remote
work
Bill
,
on
the
grounds
that
they
:
fail
to
provide
that
access
to
flexible
work
should
be
the
default
entitlement
and
not
the
exception
;
[
and
]
fail
to
include
a
presumption
that
if
work
have
be
do
remotely
during
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
it
be
reasonably
practicable
for
it
to
continue
to
be
do
remotely
"
.
what
we
be
argue
for
,
and
what
be
the
unanimous
approach
of
the
Opposition
,
be
to
reflect
the
fact
there
have
be
a
paradigm
shift
in
society
,
which
have
have
a
major
benefit
,
not
least
for
woman
.
I
might
give
the
practical
example
of
a
woman
who
work
in
the
pharmaceutical
sector
.
she
be
a
lone
parent
,
highly
skilled
and
educate
.
early
in
the
Covid
pandemic
,
she
obtain
a
promotion
.
her
employer
now
say
she
be
expect
to
work
overnight
shift
in
other
part
of
the
country
.
give
she
receive
a
promotion
during
the
pandemic
when
she
be
able
to
take
care
of
she
childcare
responsibility
,
surely
she
should
have
a
right
to
continue
to
work
as
she
have
be
do
and
not
to
have
to
work
that
overnight
shift
.
there
be
a
risk
she
will
now
have
to
leave
that
job
because
she
will
not
be
able
to
make
alternative
childcare
arrangement
.
all
we
be
try
to
do
be
to
instil
a
presumption
in
favour
of
the
right
to
have
a
flexible
arrangement
.
if
nothing
else
,
it
be
to
ensure
lone
parent
,
in
particular
,
who
want
to
work
but
who
cannot
do
so
at
present
because
of
they
childcare
arrangement
will
be
give
that
opportunity
to
be
able
to
do
so
,
such
as
in
the
case
of
the
person
I
mention
.
the
government
's
legislation
,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
will
yank
that
out
of
the
equation
.
it
be
too
weak
.
the
paradigm
shift
have
occur
,
as
he
will
have
see
on
he
commute
to
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
from
wherever
he
reside
,
as
will
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Troy
,
when
he
travel
along
the
m4
.
they
will
see
that
people
be
back
on
the
road
,
go
to
work
.
the
whole
place
be
snarl
up
and
many
of
that
people
would
be
just
as
productive
if
work
from
home
or
have
that
flexibility
,
but
the
government
's
legislative
proposal
be
too
weak
.
we
argue
that
the
Bill
fail
to
live
up
to
the
ambition
of
the
remote
work
strategy
publish
last
year
.
the
government
have
water
it
down
.
let
we
give
woman
,
in
particular
,
and
man
a
chance
.
I
refer
to
woman
who
have
attain
some
autonomy
,
be
able
to
come
back
into
the
workplace
and
achieve
promotion
,
and
who
otherwise
would
not
have
be
promote
because
of
that
pull
towards
the
need
to
provide
childcare
and
the
domestic
arrangement
they
may
have
.
let
we
give
they
a
chance
and
emb
it
as
a
right
.
female
full

time
employment
increase
by
a
impressive
7.5
%
in
the
two
-
year
period
between
the
end
of
2019
and
the
end
of
2021
.
that
be
as
a
result
of
the
pandemic
because
people
be
able
to
make
more
flexible
arrangement
.
all
we
be
ask
for
be
a
bit
of
common
sense
.
there
be
a
significant
opportunity
to
reflect
the
Zeitgeist
.
person
want
flexible
working
time
,
instil
as
a
right
,
and
we
motion
speak
to
that
.
it
be
withdraw
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
speak
on
this
motion
.
just
today
,
I
speak
to
a
94
-
year
-
old
man
who
,
with
he
wife
,
be
in
receipt
of
a
occupational
pension
.
they
do
not
pass
the
means
test
for
the
fuel
allowance
.
last
week
,
I
speak
with
a
couple
of
retirement
age
who
have
a
combine
working
life
of
84
year
between
they
,
and
they
do
not
fulfil
the
criterion
for
the
fuel
allowance
.
the
common
denominator
there
be
that
both
couple
work
hard
all
of
they
life
,
raise
family
and
pay
they
contribution
to
the
State
.
they
feel
marginalised
and
hard
do
by
in
the
midst
of
this
crisis
because
the
fuel
allowance
will
not
cover
they
.
I
will
not
advise
they
to
go
to
a
community
welfare
officer
for
a
exceptional
need
payment
because
they
be
not
that
type
of
people
.
they
be
proud
people
and
they
feel
that
the
contribution
they
have
make
through
they
taxation
should
be
enough
to
allow
for
access
,
albeit
it
might
be
on
a
temporary
basis
while
this
crisis
be
ongoing
,
to
some
recognition
by
the
state
of
they
need
and
the
cost
they
be
incur
,
particularly
on
fuel
.
I
mention
the
94
-
year
-
old
gentleman
.
he
be
most
lucid
and
he
mind
be
as
sharp
as
it
ever
be
but
he
body
be
not
where
he
would
like
it
to
be
.
he
say
to
I
today
that
he
have
to
keep
the
heating
on
because
of
the
type
of
medication
he
be
on
.
the
money
be
flow
out
of
the
door
,
so
much
so
that
the
couple
be
incur
personal
debt
.
he
say
to
I
that
if
the
fuel
allowance
be
expand
,
albeit
on
a
temporary
basis
,
to
allow
for
he
circumstance
and
that
of
he
wife
,
it
would
allow
he
to
maintain
he
dignity
and
pride
with
a
temporary
payment
to
get
he
over
this
challenge
.
we
all
recognise
that
there
be
external
force
at
play
and
nobody
would
deny
that
but
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
people
who
be
not
fulfil
the
criterion
for
fuel
allowance
and
who
be
live
in
fuel
impoverished
household
.
they
should
not
have
to
wait
for
the
national
retrofit
scheme
,
which
Age
Action
Ireland
tell
we
we
will
take
at
least
eight
year
to
meet
its
full
target
.
God
only
know
where
my
94
-
year
-
old
man
will
be
at
that
stage
of
he
life
.
we
should
at
least
put
something
in
place
now
by
way
of
a
expansion
or
extension
beyond
the
372
household
that
the
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
announce
on
14
March
.
I
note
that
the
Minister
of
State
mention
390
household
in
he
speech
so
there
be
a
contradiction
of
18000
house
there
and
there
have
be
a
inflation
of
figure
between
Department
since
14
March
.
notwithstanding
that
,
there
be
a
simple
ask
here
.
this
be
work
people
who
pay
massive
tax
to
the
State
in
the
1970
and
1980
and
make
massive
sacrifice
to
put
they
child
through
college
.
many
of
this
people
they
child
be
the
first
generation
of
child
in
they
family
to
go
to
university
or
third
level
institution
.
we
must
recognise
the
predicament
they
be
in
and
we
should
not
force
they
to
have
to
go
to
a
community
welfare
officer
.
the
State
,
through
its
Department
,
should
recognise
that
predicament
and
extend
the
fuel
allowance
,
albeit
as
a
temporary
measure
,
to
get
they
over
the
challenge
they
face
because
along
with
the
increase
in
cost
as
have
be
articulate
by
many
member
,
there
be
also
the
increase
in
the
price
of
food
.
all
of
this
people
be
on
fix
income
and
they
do
not
want
to
eat
into
they
credit
union
savings
because
by
and
large
,
this
savings
be
what
this
people
have
leave
to
bury
themselves
in
some
instance
.
the
savings
will
be
use
to
meet
emergency
family
crisis
need
or
to
bury
themselves
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
they
in
a
situation
where
they
have
to
dip
into
that
savings
.
there
be
scope
for
the
government
to
introduce
a
scheme
of
this
nature
and
I
ask
that
the
Minister
of
State
would
take
that
on
board
.
Seanad
Éireann
have
pass
the
redundancy
payment
(
amendment
)
Bill
2022
,
without
amendment
.
have
the
minister
be
inform
of
call
from
UNICEF
for
safeguard
and
child
protection
measure
to
be
put
in
place
for
child
flee
Ukraine
?
be
Ireland
and
State
agency
such
as
Tusla
in
a
position
to
safeguard
unaccompanied
minor
travel
to
the
State
from
Ukraine
and
other
conflict
zone
?
will
the
minister
detail
what
step
he
Department
be
take
to
ensure
child
protection
reporting
mechanism
be
in
place
and
accessible
to
non-native
English
or
Irish
speaker
?
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
I
be
concerned
that
there
have
be
22
referral
,
but
I
be
reassure
that
a
designate
social
worker
team
have
be
assign
.
can
the
minister
indicate
if
such
team
be
assign
at
all
point
of
entry
?
there
have
be
much
talk
about
Dublin
and
Rosslare
,
but
Ukrainian
people
be
,
to
a
less
extent
,
come
in
through
Shannon
and
Cork
airport
.
I
wish
to
seek
assurance
that
similar
team
be
be
put
in
place
at
that
point
of
entry
as
well
.
the
important
thing
for
all
of
we
be
that
child
be
be
pick
up
by
the
system
.
that
be
the
most
important
thing
because
it
would
reassure
we
.
I
pay
tribute
to
the
people
of
Buttevant
in
my
native
Cork
,
who
wrap
they
arm
around
approximately
50
Ukrainian
who
have
come
into
the
community
there
in
recent
day
.
community
be
rallying
to
support
family
and
the
effort
there
have
be
tremendous
.
if
we
be
look
for
a
model
of
community
response
,
the
Buttevant
experience
would
be
a
excellent
exemplar
for
such
a
model
.
the
Department
of
social
Protection
and
other
statutory
agency
be
begin
to
respond
to
the
need
of
people
in
Buttevant
.
I
take
that
town
as
a
example
of
other
similar
community
throughout
the
country
.
I
ask
that
Tusla
would
make
itself
know
to
that
type
of
effort
to
ensure
that
where
child
need
psychological
service
,
for
example
,
that
such
need
would
be
pick
up
,
even
where
that
child
be
accompany
by
parent
or
family
.
in

I
welcome
the
motion
,
which
we
will
absolutely
support
.
I
note
that
the
government
be
not
go
to
oppose
it
.
if
I
may
,
I
will
quote
directly
from
my
copy
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
.
when
talk
about
make
the
service
more
effective
and
the
cDNT
,
he
refer
to
what
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
have
say
,
which
be
that
:
...
the
HSE
's
messaging
around
this
have
not
be
clear
and
it
have
be
perceive
as
shift
more
responsibility
on
to
parent
.
while
all
family
be
willing
to
do
they
very
good
for
they
child
,
parent
or
guardian
be
not
therapist
.
the
family
-
cent
approach
must
be
underpin
,
support
and
facilitate
by
specialist
therapy
personnel
.
nobody
be
try
to
remove
clinical
support
from
child
.
we
need
to
bolster
they
,
not
reduce
they
.
the
family
-
cent
model
be
a
complementary
approach
to
provide
therapeutic
support
,
rather
than
a
alternative
approach
,
which
have
be
suggest
in
some
quarter
.
I
be
glad
that
the
minister
have
at
least
clarify
that
,
but
it
leave
a
question
over
the
constitution
of
the
child
's
disability
network
team
.
I
note
the
presence
of
the
senior
minister
and
I
be
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
address
he
directly
.
where
the
team
have
be
create
,
there
be
acknowledgement
that
this
be
not
a
perfect
model
.
some
work
be
ongoing
internally
on
how
that
team
will
be
roll
out
.
I
can
understand
a
proposal
to
bring
family
into
the
therapeutic
process
.
however
,
the
evidence
show
that
there
be
still
a
massive
waiting
list
not
only
for
assessment
of
need
but
also
for
psychological
service
.
I
be
not
talk
about
CAMHS
;
I
make
a
distinction
between
access
to
child
and
adult
mental
health
service
.
there
be
9554
child
wait
for
psychological
service
at
the
moment
;
14619
wait
for
occupational
therapy
;
8,666
wait
for
physiotherapy
;
33106
wait
for
some
form
of
speech
and
language
intervention
or
assessment
;
5590
wait
for
access
to
dietetic
sister
;
16,838
wait
for
ophthalmology
service
;
and
8,457
wait
for
audiology
service
.
I
do
not
want
to
become
excessively
rhetorical
about
this
because
we
be
talk
about
child
here
.
I
be
try
to
understand
how
the
cDNT
will
evolve
.
the
challenge
therein
have
be
well
articulate
.
Parent
and
public
representative
have
push
back
on
the
HSE
on
that
issue
.
the
government
or
the
HSE
do
not
buttress
that
team
with
the
resource
to
allow
for
the
follow
-
on
service
such
as
I
have
mention
.
it
be
not
just
about
the
AON
.
the
assessment
be
a
vital
element
to
get
the
child
in
the
door
but
they
then
need
the
follow
-
on
service
.
I
have
be
around
this
house
for
a
reasonably
long
period
.
I
be
confused
over
how
the
supply
of
professional
who
will
deliver
this
service
will
match
the
demand
.
I
still
cannot
see
how
the
government
will
do
that
.
we
have
not
see
a
articulation
of
that
yet
through
what
be
suppose
to
be
the
child
disability
network
team
.
I
take
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
in
good
faith
,
as
we
all
do
.
we
all
welcome
when
she
push
back
on
the
HSE
in
the
recent
past
in
respect
of
the
cDNT
.
however
,
once
a
child
get
through
the
AON
,
how
do
the
follow
-
up
service
such
as
psychology
,
occupational
therapy
,
physiotherapy
and
all
have
the
other
service
wrap
themselves
around
the
same
child
with
that
need
?
that
be
the
missing
piece
of
the
jigsaw
.
I
could
give
the
minister
chapter
and
verse
about
the
HSE
's
apparent
lack
of
internalisation
as
a
institution
culturally
of
its
need
to
be
transparent
about
how
it
spend
resource
.
the
HSE
do
not
seem
to
have
internalise
that
obligation
it
have
.
we
see
evidence
of
that
at
the
Committee
of
Public
Account
in
recent
week
where
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
highlight
the
lack
of
transparency
-
my
word
-
in
respect
of
how
budget
line
be
spend
right
down
to
provision
of
the
service
we
be
discuss
.
I
do
not
want
to
make
political
hay
out
of
this
issue
.
all
I
want
be
for
the
child
in
my
constituency
who
require
the
service
to
be
able
to
get
the
service
,
as
we
all
want
in
all
we
constituency
.
somebody
need
to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
bridge
that
gap
without
trot
out
the
same
line
,
day
in
day
out
about
recruitment
issue
.
for
people
live
in
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
region
,
CHO
2
cover
Galway
,
Mayo
and
Roscommon
,
only
two
child
be
wait
more
than
two
month
or
three
month
.
however
,
in
my
area
,
CHO
4
,
cover
County
Kerry
,
Cork
north
,
Cork
north
Lee
,
Cork
south
Lee
and
Cork
west
,
it
be
500
child
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
be
aware
of
this
.
in
some
place
,
the
system
can
be
make
to
work
to
deploy
the
resource
across
geographical
location
and
county
boundary
if
need
be
or
across
the
CHO
area
so
that
they
follow
the
child
where
there
be
spare
capacity
in
one
part
of
the
system
.
that
be
what
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
call
for
;
that
be
what
we
have
all
be
call
for
,
include
Fianna
Fáil
Deputy
.
if
that
can
be
make
to
work
,
that
would
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
I
do
not
doubt
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
in
seek
to
push
the
HSE
along
.
have
be
in
government
,
I
know
what
it
be
like
to
sit
at
that
side
of
the
table
and
I
know
what
it
be
like
to
be
hold
accountable
for
my
action
.
the
same
apply
to
we
all
if
we
be
line
minister
.
Sinn
Féin
Member
will
also
be
accountable
when
they
be
in
government
.
I
look
forward
to
that
time
.
we
all
be
accountable
ultimately
as
the
maker
of
policy
.
we
cannot
keep
hive
it
off
to
the
HSE
.
at
some
point
there
must
be
political
accountability
for
this
decision
as
they
affect
we
fellow
citizen
and
child
.
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
to
redouble
he
effort
to
bridge
the
gap
so
that
we
as
a
nation
do
not
have
16,838
child
wait
for
follow
on
ophthalmology
service
and
14619
wait
for
occupational
therapy
.
all
of
this
figure
come
from
the
HSE
's
reply
to
parliamentary
question
.
in
fairness
to
the
HSE
,
it
be
extremely
good
at
answer
parliamentary
question
.
it
will
provide
chapter
and
verse
,
line
by
line
of
all
the
detail
.
the
additional
layer
that
I
would
see
be
put
on
top
of
that
and
I
think
we
will
all
start
ask
this
question
fairly
quickly
be
:
where
be
the
expenditure
to
match
the
need
?
ultimately
,
that
be
what
this
motion
be
about
.
I
support
the
motion
and
I
be
glad
it
have
be
bring
before
we
.
collectively
,
we
have
all
be
talk
about
this
issue
.
I
would
like
to
take
the
heat
out
of
it
and
let
in
some
light
if
we
can
.
I
know
the
minister
will
want
to
achieve
much
along
with
he
ministerial
colleague
to
address
this
issue
because
the
law
now
demand
it
.
there
be
a
corpus
of
law
and
the
high
court
have
adjudicate
on
it
.
I
be
glad
to
see
the
shift
in
respect
of
what
be
a
extremely
flawed
model
relate
to
the
cDNT
.
how
will
the
minister
underpin
and
buttress
that
team
across
the
country
so
that
we
can
have
that
kind
of
complementarity
between
family
and
therapist
to
deliver
for
the
child
?
I
thank
the
Deputy
.
I
accept
that
clarity
as
quickly
as
possible
be
important
.
farmer
be
make
decision
about
the
situation
in
which
they
find
themselves
.
every
pig
that
leave
a
farm
at
the
moment
be
lose
the
farmer
a
significant
amount
of
money
,
and
that
be
increase
by
the
day
.
I
be
very
much
aware
of
the
situation
and
have
be
liais
very
closely
with
the
sector
for
a
significant
period
of
time
.
the
€
7
billion
scheme
announce
three
or
four
week
ago
just
before
the
war
in
Ukraine
equate
to
€
20000
per
farmer
.
the
ongoing
travesty
in
Ukraine
have
have
significant
implication
for
all
sector
,
in
particular
the
agrifood
sector
,
of
which
the
pig
sector
be
undoubtedly
the
part
most
affect
.
I
will
meet
the
IFA
and
farmer
late
today
let
we
be
clear
.
the
ask
from
the
IFA
of
the
government
be
massive
,
namely
€
100
million
up
front
.
in
term
of
the
€
7
million
scheme
I
launch
,
the
350
commercial
pig
unit
concerned
would
seem
to
translate
into
240
individual
undertaking
,
and
€
100
million
would
equate
to
€
420000
per
undertaking
.
if
€50
million
be
cover
by
the
State
and
€
50
million
by
levy
,
that
would
amount
to
€
210000
in
state
contribution
,
with
€
210000
to
be
pay
back
under
the
proposal
in
a
levy
over
ten
year
or
so
.
that
be
the
nature
of
the
ask
,
and
it
be
massive
.
I
be
very
much
aware
of
the
pressure
on
the
sector
.
the
deputy
be
correct
.
it
be
a
sustainable
and
valuable
industry
,
the
third
large
within
we
agrifood
sector
.
we
want
to
ensure
it
be
there
for
the
future
.
I
be
very
much
aware
of
how
acute
the
bottom
of
the
hole
sector
find
itself
in
be
at
the
moment
.
I
will
work
and
engage
with
farmer
on
how
I
can
work
with
they
to
support
the
sector
through
this
.
I
again
thank
Deputy
O'
Sullivan
and
Carthy
and
the
many
other
Deputy
who
raise
this
issue
with
I
in
recent
day
.
be
the
minister
of
State
aware
of
the
issue
that
be
affect
the
quality
of
ash
for
maker
of
hurley
?
be
she
aware
the
game
of
hurl
have
UNESCO
intangible
heritage
status
?
I
want
to
ensure
a
process
be
put
in
place
to
support
the
game
of
hurl
on
the
basis
that
Canning
Hurleys
have
announce
it
be
close
today
.
it
be
a
major
hammer
blow
to
the
game
of
hurl
in
this
country
and
I
seek
the
government
's
response
to
that
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
as
I
state
at
the
outset
,
the
game
of
hurl
be
embed
in
the
Irish
psyche
and
it
have
UNESCO
intangible
heritage
status
.
when
a
family
company
like
Canning
Hurleys
announce
last
week
it
be
close
today
,
that
be
a
hammer
blow
to
everybody
who
love
the
game
of
hurl
,
no
matter
what
part
of
the
country
they
be
in
,
because
the
Canning
family
be
synonymous
with
the
game
.
will
the
Minister
of
State
convene
a
meeting
with
Croke
Park
,
Teagasc
,
Coillte
and
the
Irish
Guild
of
Ash
Hurley
Makers
as
soon
as
possible
?
I
note
that
meeting
have
take
place
several
time
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
say
.
however
,
would
she
consider
reconvenen
a
meeting
at
the
early
possible
opportunity
as
a
matter
of
urgency
to
deal
with
supply
issue
?
one
of
the
supply
line
come
from
Ukraine
and
that
make
the
issue
particularly
urgent
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
willingness
to
do
that
.
will
she
inform
the
House
when
she
propose
to
write
to
they
and
set
up
that
meeting
because
we
cannot
afford
to
lose
hurley
-
maker
?
they
be
the
supply
line
,
bloodline
and
bloodstock
of
that
sport
.
will
the
Minister
of
State
place
a
degree
of
urgency
on
this
issue
?
it
would
be
wonderful
if
we
be
to
hear
from
she
that
she
be
conven
,
as
a
matter
of
urgency
,
a
meeting
of
all
the
stakeholder
as
early
as
next
week
or
the
week
after
,
for

I
have
just
receive
notification
this
very
minute
that
a
company
,
Positive
Care
,
which
provide
residential
service
for
young
people
,
be
to
be

the

provide

service
for
vulnerable
young
people
in
up

25
facility
,
as
I
understand
it
.
I
appreciate
that
I
be
inquire
with
the
Taoiseach
about
this
matter
at
very
short
notice
,
but
I
ask
he
to
make
himself
aware
of
what
be
happen
.
it
be
very
serious
for
the
provision
of
service
for
young
,
vulnerable
people
,
especially
that
who
be
in
residential

.
the
loss
of
this
service
provider
represent
a
massive
blow
to
the
capability
of
this
country
to
provide
for
the
most
vulnerable
of

we

some
of

there
be
no

for

the
Ukrainian

have
fight

defeat
the
Russian

in

they
face

method
to

must
also
be
part
of
that
future
.
in
conclusion
,
since
last
November
the
Labour
Party
have
advocate
a
reduction
in
the
vat
rate
on
electricity
and
gas
supplies
,
which
be
currently
13.5
%
.
in
January
we
tab
a
motion
in
the
House
explicitly
call
on
the
government
to
seek
a
derogation
from
the
EU
that
would
allow
we
to
reduce
this
vat
rate
and
restore
it
back
to
that
pre-crisis
level
.
we
again
call
on
the
government
to
secure
that
derogation
to
help
tackle
the
cost
of
living
crisis
.
I
support
the
motion
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
question
no.
688
,
which
I
tab
on
5
April
to
the
Minister
for
Health
,
in
which
I
ask
he
if
he
would
report
on
the
housing
for
all
plan
for
a
amend
fair
deal
scheme
to
remove
disincentive
for
sale
and
rental
of
vacant
property
.
the
question
be
answer
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Butler
.
it
state
:
my
Department
be
actively
collaborate
with
the
Department
of
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
and
other
Department
in
the
development
of
a
mechanism
in
relation
to
the
rental
of
vacant
property
"
in
a
way
that
be
target
,
equitable
,
evidence
-
base
and
provide
appropriate
safeguard
for
vulnerable
old
people
"
,
as
commit
to
in
housing
for
all
action
19.8
.
complex
policy
question
be
currently
be
resolve
in
order
to
meet
this
criterion
and
mitigate
the
high
risk
and
cost
associate
with
unintended
consequence
,
with
a
view
to
introduce
legislation
as
soon
as
possible
once
this
be
complete
.
I
expect
to
be
in
a
position
to
bring
legislation
forward
in
the
come
month
.
when
we
receive
this
reply
,
we
try
to
dig
into
the
language
of
what
they
mean
.
I
take
some
solace
that
where
the
minister
state
,
"
I
expect
to
be
in
a
position
to
bring
legislation
forward
in
the
come
month
"
,
she
mean
what
she
say
in
that
regard
.
there
be
a
legitimate
expectation
on
the
part
of
member
and
the
public
that
this
legislation
would
be
promulgate
as
soon
as
possible
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
be
so
many
house
out
there
that
be
vacant
as
a
result
of
people
be
in
nursing
home
or
participant
on
a
elder
care
scheme
or
the
nursing
home
support
scheme
.
I
ask
that
some
urgency
be
give
to
that
legislation
.
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Noonan
,
in
respond
to
the
motion
might
give
we
some
sense
of
a
timeline
for
when
that
legislation
might
be
bring
before
we
.
the
language
use
in
reply
to
parliamentary
question
be
sometimes
quite
dense
.
as
outline
above
,
the
reply
state
,
"
complex
policy
question
be
currently
be
resolve
in
order
to
meet
this
criterion
and
mitigate
the
high
risk
and
cost
associate
with
unintended
consequence
...
"
.
I
have
a
sense
of
what
that
might
mean
,
but
I
would
prefer
clarity
on
what
exactly
it
mean
and
on
the
stumbling
block
to
that
happen
.
if
that
hurdle
be
jump
and
the
legislation
be
bring
before
we
,
it
would
create
a
supply
line
of
house
for
many
people
.
that
seem
to
be
low
-
hang
fruit
.
within
we
constituency
,
we
all
see
the
evidence
of
vacant
home
as
a
result
of
people
be
in
nursing
home
through
the
nursing
home
support
scheme
.
if
government
could
do
that
one
thing
as
a
early
win
,
perhaps
before
the
end
of
this
year
,
it
would
release
a
lot
of
house
for
people
to
live
in
.
ultimately
,
the
motion
be
about
get
people
into
house
.
I
agree
with
the
spirit
of
the
motion
and
the
request
for
urgency
.
if
the
sense
of
urgency
that
we
apply
to
the
Covid
response
,
where
we
act
collaboratively
,
be
apply
to
the
get
the
supply
of
housing
in
this
country
sort
,
the
government
would
find
itself
push
a
open
door
.
it
would
take
a
lot
of
the
political
heat
and
rhetoric
out
of
the
issue
.
it
would
also
take
a
lot
of
the
personality
and
the
ego
out
of
it
.
in
term
of
some
of
the
ego
that
have
inform
this
debate
,
it
be
a
little
bit
unedifying
,
especially
when
we
be
try
to
provide
housing
for
people
who
genuinely
need
it
.
if
that
same
sense
of
urgency
be
apply
to
this
issue
,
the
government
would
be
push
a
open
door
with
many
deputy
across
the
House
.
if
appropriate
,
I
would
like
a
specific
response
to
the
query
that
I
have
raise
in
respect
of
the
nursing
home
scenario
because
that
have
come
up
time
and
again
in
this
motion
.
if
be
a
overarching
theme
of
this
motion
.
if
we
could
get
a
real
response
to
that
,
we
would
be
very
grateful
.
as
of
November
2020
,
there
be
61880
household
on
the
social
housing
waiting
list
.
that
be
the
late
figure
we
have
,
but
there
may
be
update
figure
.
the
Minister
of
State
and
I
know
that
much
of
we
work
in
constituency
be
around
advocate
for
people
to
access
local
authority
housing
.
there
be
unintended
consequence
of
be
on
a
list
for
that
in
private
rent
accommodation
.
more
people
be
come
to
we
state
that
they
rental
agreement
be
come
to
a
end
or
that
they
landlord
be
sell
the
property
.
many
accidental
landlord
be
get
out
of
the
market
and
that
be
have
a
untold
knock
-
on
effect
.
it
be
not
just
about
a
lack
of
housing
supply
;
it
be
the
other
stressor
that
create
within
family
as
a
result
of
not
have
the
security
or
fixity
of
tenure
that
be
so
often
a
staple
of
political
discourse
in
this
country
long
before
even
this
House
be
establish
.
the
idea
of
fixity
of
rent
and
fixity
of
tenure
,
security
and
a
roof
over
one
's
head
be
fundamental
principle
embed
in
the
Irish
psyche
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
negative
.
I
be
try
to
be
proactive
and
progressive
in
seek
to
support
the
government
when
the
government
be
worthy
of
support
.
I
sense
from
the
answer
I
receive
to
my
question
on
the
nursing
home
support
scheme
and
the
already
state
policy
of
seek
to
let
into
the
market
that
house
or
to
provide
a
supply
of
house
,
be
that
urgency
be
not
there
and
there
be
too
many
technocratic
and
bureaucratic
impediment
in
the
way
of
do
that
.
I
hope
that
hurdle
can
be
jump
so
that
we
can
release
this
supply
of
house
.
there
need
to
be
great
urgency
.
every
deputy
and
senator
across
the
political
divide
be
solution
-
drive
and
want
to
see
that
supply
.
we
will
do
everything
we
can
within
we
constituency
to
facilitate
that
supply
.
however
,
there
need
to
be
a
top
-
down
approach
.
arguably
,
the
policy
be
move
too
slowly
.
I
say
that
respectfully
.
Fine
Gael
have
be
in
government
for
quite
a
long
time
.
the
government
of
which
the
Labour
Party
be
a
part
between
2011
and
2016
do
not
have
money
to
build
house
.
we
have
to
make
stark
choice
.
at
the
latter
end
of
2015
and
in
2016
,
we
make
money
available
for
house
building
but
we
have
not
see
the
throughput
of
supply
since
2016
.
it
be
high
time
we
build
more
house
in
this
country
and
sort
out
this
problem
.
the
money
be
there
,
as
be
the
willingness
and
impetus
to
do
the
work
.
we
need
to
see
great
government
action
.

do
the
Minister
for
Finance
intend
to
introduce
a
windfall
tax
on
the
extraordinary
profit
of
energy
company
to
fund
measure
to
combat
the
rise
cost
of
energy
for
household
and
enterprise
?
early
this
month
the
minister
indicate
that
he
be
finally
,
as
it
be
put
,
evaluate
the
potential
of
slap
energy
supplier
with
windfall
tax
bill
.
I
want
to
know
if
that
will
come
to
fruition
.
I
welcome
the
fact
the
government
have
finally
come
around
at
least
to
evaluate
,
to
use
the
minister
's
word
,
a
windfall
tax
on
extraordinary
profit
.
this
be
a
proposal
the
government
vote
against
in
January
when
the
Labour
Party
include
it
as
part
of
we
cost
-
of
-
living
motion
.
we
know
energy
company
like
the
ESB
,
which
be
not
immediately
tie
into
rise
price
,
make
€679
million
in
profit
last
year
,
as
thousand
of
homeowner
struggle
to
pay
soar
energy
bill
.
next
week
,
ESB
's
electric
Ireland
will
go
ahead
with
a
near
25
%
increase
in
electricity
and
gas
price
.
we
know
that
a
conservative
estimate
,
base
on
2020
figure
,
suggest
this
could
raise
to
the
tune
of
€
60
million
to
help
pay
for
cost
-
of
-
living
support
for
household
.
will
the
minister
of
State
give
we
a
clear
indication
as
to
the
timeline
for
the
completion
of
the
evaluation
?
that
will
not
cut
the
mustard
with
the
business
and
household
I
deal
with
in
my
constituency
.
the
Spanish
government
be
able
to
do
this
.
it
introduce
a
windfall
tax
on
energy
company
last
September
,
therefore
,
there
be
a
precedent
set
in
the
European
Union
on
this
.
I
want
to
give
some
solace
to
the
small
business
and
householder
in
my
constituency
.
the
Spanish
case
be
a
clear
example
of
how
fund
generate
through
the
windfall
tax
be
pay
for
the
country
's
vat
energy
tax
cut
introduce
in
the
same
month
last
year
.
there
be
proof
of
concept
and
this
tax
be
work
in
another
EU
member
state
.
I
ask
that
great
urgency
be
give
to
this
concept
,
thereby
bring
to
fruition
a
windfall
tax
on
profit
.

thank
you
very
much
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
.
we
welcome
the
motion
.
to
be
fair
,
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
minister
be
do
he
good
.
it
would
be
good
if
we
could
take
some
of
the
heat
out
of
this
debate
because
it
have
become
quite
personalised
of
late
.
I
know
we
all
have
to
robustly
defend
we
position
in
this
House
.
that
be
right
and
proper
.
however
,
the
personalised
nature
of
the
debate
do
not
give
comfort
to
the
people
who
be
on
the
housing
list
in
my
constituency
.
if
I
be
to
characterise
they
experience
at
present
,
it
be
such
that
,
historically
,
if
you
be
on
a
housing
list
you
be
apply
for
a
house
from
a
rent
house
or
a
family
home
and
you
have
a
guarantee
of
a
roof
over
you
head
.
increasingly
,
however
,
we
,
as
public
representative
,
be
see
more
and
more
people
come
to
we
in
desperation
because
they
be
be
force
out
of
accommodation
through
a
notice
to
quit
and
they
have
absolutely
no
place
to
go
due
to
the
lack
of
supply
.
that
be
acknowledge
.
I
do
not
want
to
politicise
this
debate
.
I
acknowledge
the
fact
that
the
government
be
seek
to
do
what
it
can
through
the
housing
for
all
policy
.
one
of
my
worry
be
as
follow
.
let
we
take
a
town
like
Mitchelstown
in
County
Cork
.
it
be
a
typical
rural
town
that
have
a
agricultural
hinterland
.
there
be
a
phenomenal
demand
for
housing
in
Mitchelstown
and
there
be
also
a
capacity
to
build
house
.
in
spite
of
the
pent
-
up
demand
that
exist
,
however
,
there
be
a
major
issue
in
term
of
the
ability
to
provide
essential
service
such
as
water
and
waste
water
treatment
facility
.
for
a
couple
of
year
,
my
constituency
colleague
and
I
have
all
advocate
for
a
increase
in
capacity
for
water
and
waste
water
service
because
,
as
we
speak
,
we
cannot
build
house
in
the
town
of
Mitchelstown
because
Irish
Water
will
tell
the
local
authority
that
the
capacity
be
not
there
.
it
be
all
well
and
good
for
we
to
talk
about
the
supply
that
be
come
on
stream
now
.
land
be
be
zone
in
county
development
plan
and
we
be
see
,
theoretically
,
wonderful
opportunity
emerge
on
the
horizon
,
but
the
pinch
point
be
the
fact
that
if
we
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
deliver
basic
infrastructure
,
such
as
be
the
case
in
Mitchelstown
,
then
the
policy
fail
.
until
such
time
as
the
nettle
be
grasp
on
that
issue
,
I
suspect
that
town
like
Mitchelstown
and
my
native
town
of
Mallow
,
where
there
be
a
strategic
housing
development
application
for
299
residential
unit
before
a
Bord
Pleanála
with
a
decision
date
due
for
23
May
,
will
fail
to
provide
sufficient
housing
.
in
the
event
that
the
planning
permission
be
grant
,
I
guarantee
that
Irish
Water
and
the
local
authority
will
turn
around
and
say
that
the
planning
may
have
be
receive
but
the
commencement
will
not
be
give
until
such
time
as
there
be
capacity
to
deal
with
water
and
infrastructure
.
if
that
issue
be
deal
with
as
a
top
priority
the
minister
could
pick
off
a
lot
of
low
-
hang
fruit
.
he
know
that
anyway
.
I
know
for
a
fact
that
he
be
very
much
aware
of
the
infrastructural
issue
relate
to
Mitchelstown
in
particular
.
I
understand
that
he
might
visit
the
town
in
the
not
-
too
-
distant
future
.
I
ask
he
to
use
he
good
office
to
lean
in
to
Irish
Water
.
if
some
capacity
be
deliver
in
Mitchelstown
,
it
would
have
a
tremendous
effect
,
as
it
would
throughout
the
country
.
we
support
the
motion
put
forward
by
Sinn
Féin
.
in
the
few
short
minute
remain
,
I
would
like
to
speak
about
the
tenant
in
situ
scheme
advocate
by
the
Labour
Party
.
I
urge
that
we
lift
the
cap
on
the
ability
of
local
authority
to
purchase
when
there
be
a
hap
or
ras
-
some
people
be
still
on
the
latter
scheme
-
support
tenant
in
situ
.
the
limit
on
local
authority
's
buy
second
-
hand
home
and
compete
with
first
-
time
buyer
be
have
consequence
whereby
people
who
be
get
social
housing
support
through
hap
be
then
be
evict
by
small
landlord
who
be
leave
the
housing
market
.
that
have
be
well
signal
to
the
minister
.
because
of
this
limit
,
there
be
a
unintended
consequence
of
force
people
who
require
social
housing
support
into
homelessness
.
that
be
what
I
speak
about
at
the
top
of
my
intervention
here
tonight
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
look
at
great
flexibility
around
a
tenant
in
situ
scheme
and
to
allow
local
authority
to
purchase
housing
where
there
be
a
tenant
in
situ
get
social
housing
support
.
I
be
sure
the
minister
will
have
a
answer
to
that
.
I
would
welcome
a
reply
.
if
he
be
favourable
to
that
,
it
would
be
good
.
the
other
point
I
wish
to
raise
relate
to
the
Croí
Cónaithe
scheme
.
if
the
minister
be
respond
to
the
debate
-----
I
thank
the
minister
.
I
want
to
put
it
on
the
record
that
I
ask
he
about
this
scheme
on
5
April
and
I
receive
a
reply
from
he
today
.
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
if
he
will
report
on
a
new
Croí
Cónaithe
fund
under
Housing
for
all
to
increase
owner
-
occupier
apartment
development
in
city
centre
.
I
know
it
be
a
city
-
focus
scheme
.
in
he
reply
,
the
minister
state
he
Department
be
currently
work
with
the
Housing
Agency
on
finalise
the
operational
basis
for
the
new
fund
and
it
expect
to
engage
with
prospective
proposer
in
the
call
for
proposal
in
the
second
quarter
of
2022
.
if
the
minister
or
he
official
be
listen
,
I
would
be
pleased
if
I
could
get
great
clarity
as
to
when
that
be
happen
because
it
would
facilitate
a
lot
of
accommodation
opportunity
over
the
shop
or
commercial
premise
to
turn
they
into
residential
space
.
what
be
not
know
out
there
be
the
number
of
scheme
that
be
available
for
town
.
the
big
impediment
to
somebody
in
a
town
or
city
convert
what
be
a
commercial
premise
into
a
residential
premise
,
where
there
be
perhaps
intergenerational
owner
,
be
that
they
be
not
go
to
make
the
leap
towards
convert
to
residential
with
all
of
the
attendant
grant
that
be
available
because
the
capital
cost
of
do
so
be
still
too
high
.
they
may
be
asset
rich
but
cash
poor
and
they
be
at
pain
to
take
the
risk
of
borrowing
.
there
be
hundred
of
town
throughout
the
country
where
we
have
lose
capacity
on
the
main
street
,
where
shop
and
commercial
premise
have
close
.
there
be
many
people
who
would
like
to
live
in
town
,
people
who
be
downsizing
and
want
to
be
close
to
service
on
the
main
street
,
which
would
free
up
many
house
.
yet
,
people
do
not
perceive
that
there
be
anything
in
place
for
they
to
be
able
to
do
that
.
we
need
more
scheme
that
be
fasttrack
.
there
should
be
a
treatment
in
planning
that
could
facilitate
that
and
that
could
allow
for
good
funding
of
it
.
on
the
Labour
Party
's
residential
Tenancy
(
Tenant
's
rights
)
Bill
2021
,
there
remain
a
huge
imbalance
in
power
between
renter
and
landlord
.
we
Bill
focus
on
issue
relate
to
quality
of
rental
accommodation
.
we
need
to
get
solid
commitment
when
it
come
to
security
of
tenure
.
that
be
ultimately
the
bedrock
upon
which
renter
's
rights
be
base
.
I
will
return
to
the
issue
on
which
I
speak
in
relation
to
Mitchelstown
and
Mallow
,
for
instance
.
this
be
two
example
of
two
typical
town
.
the
capacity
constraint
and
the
infrastructural
constraint
will
require
that
more
people
will
be
in
rent
accommodation
for
long
.
that
market
trend
for
rent
be
go
upwards
.
the
housing
assistance
payment
,
HAP
,
be
not
meet
pace
with
demand
.
there
need
to
be
a
rights
-
base
approach
for
tenant
for
the
duration
of
this
housing
crisis
.
that
be
what
we
advocate
for
in
that
Bill
.
I
ask
that
that
Bill
would
be
look
at
again
.
I
thank
deputy
Buckley
for
again
raise
this
issue
on
behalf
of
the
community
.
it
be
a
very
frustrating
thing
,
especially
on
Christmas
Day
,
when
you
run
into
trouble
or
you
be
be
advise
of
a
boil
water
notice
.
I
think
of
the
four
topical
issue
matter
tonight
,
deputy
Buckley
be
definitely
in
front
because
he
have
a
interim
solution
,
which
hopefully
will
be
ready
by
late
at
June
,
as
I
have
in
my
briefing
document
.
second
,
the
deputy
have
a
permanent
solution
,
which
be
in
the
Irish
Water
capital
budget
.
upon
review
my
four
topical
issue
matter
tonight
,
to
be
tell
that
work
could
start
in
2024
with
a

I
welcome
the
publication
of
this
Bill
in
the
name
of
deputy
Bacik
.
I
congratulate
my
colleague
for
bring
forward
this
Bill
and
that
who
work
on
it
within
we
team
on
the
Labour
bench
.
it
be
worth
reiterate
what
the
Bill
set
out
to
do
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
Minister
of
State
say
the
government
be
not
oppose
it
at
second
Stage
.
in
Ireland
,
approximately
380000
worker
earn
less
than
the
officially
accept
threshold
of
low
pay
,
which
be
two
third
of
median
income
.
this
be
one
of
the
high
proportion
of
worker
on
low
pay
,
approximately
one
fifth
,
in
the
European
Union
or
OECD
.
woman
be
more
likely
than
man
to
be
in
a
low
pay
job
.
in
June
2000
,
when
the
first
national
minimum
wage
rate
be
declare
,
it
be
set
at
a
level
slightly
high
than
two
third
of
the
median
average
income
.
follow
the
recommendation
of
the
national
minimum
wage
commission
publish
in
April
1998
,
the
initial
rate
be
€
4.40
,
which
be
approximately
73
%
of
the
median
hourly
earnings
of
€
6
.
follow
the
initial
rate
,
however
,
the
national
minimum
wage
,
or
NMW
as
we
call
it
,
have
fail
to
keep
up
with
rise
in
median
average
income
,
fall
to
close
to
40
%
of
median
earnings
.
as
the
Minister
of
State
say
,
the
programme
for
government
have
commit
to
progress
from
the
current
national
minimum
wage
to
a
living
wage
.
it
be
important
for
we
to
explain
for
people
who
be
listen
to
and
watch
this
debate
that
there
be
a
significant
difference
between
the
minimum
wage
and
a
living
wage
.
that
have
be
well
articulate
by
we
colleague
.
we
want
progress
on
this
.
we
be
now
two
year
into
this
government
.
the
low
pay
Commission
have
furnish
its
report
to
the
minister
and
we
would
like
great
urgency
with
regard
to
its
publication
.
whatever
recommendation
be
in
that
report
would
give
life
to
that
living
wage
that
we
be
all
advocate
for
.
unlike
the
national
minimum
wage
,
which
be
not
base
on
the
cost
of
living
,
a
living
wage
can
be
define
as
the
rate
of
pay
that
would
enable
full
-
time
employ
adult
across
the
State
to
afford
a
minimum
socially
acceptable
standard
of
living
.
it
provide
for
need
,
not
want
.
it
be
evidence
-
base
and
ground
in
social
consensus
.
that
be
the
purpose
of
this
Bill
.
it
be
worth
articulate
the
view
of
that
who
be
under
severe
pressure
at
the
moment
,
that
be
,
low
-
pay
worker
throughout
Irish
society
,
people
like
Linda
,
a
young
work
parent
in
Cork
,
who
contact
we
to
say
:
a
pay
increase
would
mean
that
I
would
be
able
to
afford
the
necessary
maintenance
my
house
be
in
desperate
need
of
.
at
the
moment
with
childcare
be
so
expensive
I
do
not
know
if
I
can
keep
my
job
.
my
husband
's
job
be
a
low
pay
job
and
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
it
feel
like
I
be
damned
if
I
do
and
damned
if
I
do
not
.
it
be
precisely
people
like
Linda
we
be
speak
for
here
.
they
be
now
in
a
position
where
they
do
not
even
know
if
they
can
maintain
themselves
in
full
-
time
employment
.
there
be
a
cost
to
they
in
keep
they
job
.
that
be
the
irony
and
tragedy
of
the
situation
.
it
may
,
ironically
,
be
more
beneficial
for
somebody
like
Linda
to
move
to
a
situation
where
the
family
be
entirely
dependent
on
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
it
be
for
that
people
that
we
speak
.
I
think
the
Minister
of
State
be
sympathetic
to
that
,
to
be
fair
to
he
.
he
have
say
he
be
not
go
to
oppose
the
Bill
.
this
be
a
issue
on
which
all
of
we
in
this
House
can
unite
.
if
we
can
all
work
together
to
bring
about
this
living
wage
and
have
a
meaningful
impact
for
people
like
Linda
and
thousand
of
other
like
she
,
we
will
have
do
a
good
day
's
work
.
I
welcome
this
legislation
.
it
be
no
easy
task
to
transpose
EU
directive
.
I
applaud
the
effort
of
the
Minister
of
State
and
he
official
in
this
regard
and
in
present
this
Bill
.
starting
with
the
issue
of
domain
name
,
specifically
.ie
domain
name
,
there
be
309953
such
.ie
domain
.
only
278042
of
that
be
base
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
,
while
4532
be
base
in
Northern
Ireland
.
the
kernel
of
my
point
be
that
this
leave
31,911
of
that
.ie
website
operate
from
outside
the
island
of
Ireland
.
where
do
consumer
stand
when
they
procure
a
product
or
service
from
a
domain
register
in
Ireland
but
whose
activity
be
offshore
,
perhaps
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
or
elsewhere
globally
,
whether
in
the
EU
or
in
a
third
country
?
if
such
a
company
be
base
in
the
UK
,
where
do
consumer
stand
regard
they
rights
in
the
context
of
the
transposition
of
this
directive
into
Irish
law
?
if
consumer
purchase
goods
and
service
from
company
in
the
UK
,
via
a
.ie
domain
or
another
such
domain
,
where
stand
they
rights
?
despite
Brexit
,
people
in
Ireland
be
still
consume
a
significant
number
of
goods
purchase
online
from
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
we
do
not
know
if
this
legislation
be
silent
or
active
on
the
dynamic
of
protect
the
rights
of
consumer
in
this
context
.
Consumer
be
protect
in
a
EU
context
because
this
be
a
EU
directive
be
transpose
.
if
some
clarity
could
be
provide
on
this
point
by
the
Minister
of
State
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
.
I
raise
this
matter
because
we
be
increasingly
come
across
instance
of
fraud
where
people
who
have
log
onto
a
.ie
domain
to
procure
goods
or
service
find
they
money
have
go
into
the
ether
,
the
service
or
goods
do
not
arrive
and
there
be
no
recourse
whatsoever
for
that
consumer
.
this
trend
be
on
a
upward
trajectory
.
that
be
the
first
issue
I
wish
to
raise
regard
this
legislation
.
I
turn
to
the
issue
of
internet
service
provider
,
isp
,
specifically
section
2
of
the
Bill
,
where
there
be
a
interpretation
of
a
"
electronic
communication
service
"
.
this
be
define
as
"
a
service
normally
provide
for
remuneration
via
electronic
communication
network
,
which
encompass
,
with
the
exception
of
a
service
provide
,
or
exercising
editorial
control
over
,
content
transmit
use
electronic
communication
network
and
service
,
the
follow
type
of
service
"
.
this
service
be
then
set
out
in
section
2
(
a
)
.
they
include
"
a
publicly
available
electronic
communication
service
that
provide
a
internet
access
service
"
.
I
take
that
to
mean
that
if
a
company
be
a
internet
service
provider
,
and
offer
a
broadband
service
encompass
several
platform
,
such
as
wi-fi
,
television
service
and
other
similar
service
,
then
the
legislation
cover
such
a
service
,
as
I
understand
it
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
the
position
be
unclear
to
I
,
notwithstand
the
Minister
of
State
's
point
that
the
Competition
and
consumer
Protection
Commission
,
the
Central
Bank
and
ComReg
will
all
have
a
role
in
enforce
the
legislation
.
as
I
understand
it
,
under
the
Bill
a
consumer
be
give
a
general
right
to
withhold
any
outstanding
part
of
payment
to
the
trader
until
the
trader
's
obligation
be
fulfil
.
in
that
circumstance
,
the
price
withheld
by
the
consumer
should
be
proportionate
to
the
decrease
in
value
of
the
digital
content
or
supply
that
do
not
conform
with
the
contract
and
the
consumer
's
decision
to
withhold
payment
must
be
express
in
a
statement
to
the
trader
.
I
will
use
a
concrete
example
to
illustrate
the
outworking
of
that
.
let
we
say
I
sign
a
contract
with
a
isp
for
the
provision
of
my
broadband
on
a
residential
or
commercial
basis
and
that
service
be
subject
to
regular
outage
or
broadband
speed
be
less
than
adequate
,
for
instance
,
where
one
isp
be
offer
service
of
up
to
1
gb
but
the
service
provide
be
far
less
than
1
gb
and
no
good
than
4G
such
that
,
at
time
,
people
have
to
switch
over
to
4G
or
even
3g
because
the
service
be
so
bad
.
in
the
context
I
have
just
outline
,
what
recourse
do
the
consumer
have
?
if
the
consumer
advise
the
broadband
provider
that
he
or
she
have
call
its
helpline
on
numerous
occasion
and
be
not
get
the
service
for
which
,
for
example
,
he
or
she
be
pay
€
80
a
month
,
be
not
satisfied
with
the
service
and
be
now
withhold
the
follow
month
's
bill
until
such
time
as
the
isp
provide
he
or
she
with
the
service
it
have
contract
to
provide
,
what
mechanism
be
open
to
the
consumer
in
that
instance
?
as
it
stand
,
I
do
not
see
where
the
legislation
speak
to
that
very
dynamic
.
I
be
open
to
correction
on
this
,
but
from
my
perspective
and
in
term
of
a
consumer
protection
etho
,
there
do
not
seem
to
be
some
mechanism
build
into
the
legislation
that
allow
the
consumer
to
push
back
against
the
isp
without
the
isp
say
it
will
just
switch
off
the
service
.
there
need
to
be
some
mechanism
build
in
,
a
protection
for
the
consumer
,
to
allow
he
or
she
to
make
a
complaint
and
withhold
,
per
the
legislation
,
part
-
payment
or
a
proportionate
decrease
in
the
value
of
the
digital
content
that
be
be
provide
in
a
way
that
give
he
or
she
some
sort
of
assurance
and
confidence
that
he
or
she
can
do
so
without
be
penalise
or
the
service
cut
off
by
the
isp
.
if
the
legislation
can
speak
to
that
dynamic
in
very
explicit
term
,
it
will
send
a
clear
message
to
the
isp
that
there
be
redress
when
the
consumer
have
a
issue
.
the
reason
I
be
raise
this
issue
specifically
be
that
every
week
thousand
of
household
that
have
contract
with
isp
have
to
go
through
outage
and
blackout
or
be
switch
over
to
3g
and
4G
because
they
be
not
get
the
service
they
have
enter
into
a
contract
to
receive
and
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
recourse
for
they
.
will
this
legislation
protect
the
person
who
procure
the
service
of
a
isp
?
that
be
one
element
.
my
understanding
of
the
legislation
be
that
Irish
consumer
be
be
afford
a
robust
network
of
redress
option
as
part
of
they
newly
-
find
digital
rights
,
include
a
right
to
a
full
refund
,
exchange
or
repair
,
when
the
digital
content
or
digital
service
contract
be
not
as
describe
or
not
fit
for
the
purpose
intend
.
where
the
trader
be
liable
to
the
consumer
due
to
any
failure
to
supply
or
lack
of
conformity
of
the
digital
content
or
digital
service
with
the
digital
content
or
digital
service
contract
,
the
Bill
provide
that
a
consumer
may
pursue
remedy
against
the
person
liable
for
the
failure
or
lack
of
conformity
.
this
be
probably
a
nice
way
of
say
what
I
have
be
try
to
say
for
the
past
five
minute
.
it
be
concise
legal
language
that
have
be
offer
to
I
by
the
law
firm
,
Matheson
,
and
I
acknowledge
its
role
in
that
.
however
,
it
all
boil
down
to
the
kernel
of
the
point
that
I
be
make
,
namely
,
what
mechanism
do
the
consumer
have
,
without
place
a
undue
burden
where
the
proof
be
absolute
in
respect
of
the
lack
of
the
service
be
provide
?
we
cannot
have
a
situation
where
we
be
put
consumer
through
hoop
to
have
they
rights
vindicate
.
if
we
be
talk
about
consumer
have
to
go
to
the
CCPC
or
ComReg
on
a
issue
such
as
this
,
they
would
be
forgive
for
think
that
ComReg
might
not
have
the
capacity
to
deal
with
the
individual
case
if
there
be
hundred
,
or
possibly
thousand
,
of
that
come
in
its
door
every
week
.
can
some
mechanism
be
find
to
ensure
the
legislation
be
so
robust
that
there
be
no
way
that
the
isp
can
slip
off
the
hook
so
easily
?
what
I
be
advocate
be
that
if
a
consumer
decide
to
take
a
case
,
make
a
complaint
or
seek
redress
or
compensation
for
the
loss
of
service
,
they
should
not
face
a
onerous
burden
in
do
so
.
I
reiterate
the
point
in
regard
to
Brexit
.
where
stand
the
consumer
in
this
new
paradigm
in
which
,
post
Brexit
,
we
be
still
try
to
negotiate
we
relationship
with
the
Unite
Kingdom
in
regard
to
the
procurement
of
goods
and
service
?
where
goods
or
service
be
procure
from
the
UK
,
that
be
another
jurisdiction
and
obviously
not
subject
to
EU
law
.
be
there
a
mechanism
within
this
legislation
that
protect
the
rights
of
Irish
consumer
?
there
be
probably
hundred
of
thousand
of
online
transaction
at
a
residential
and
commercial
level
every
week
for
which
there
be
no
recourse
that
I
can
see
at
present
.
that
be
not
anybody
's
fault
.
it
be
a
matter
for
politics
and
beg
the
question
as
to
whether
there
be
something
in
the
Bill
that
can
speak
to
that
dynamic
.
I
welcome
the
legislation
.
I
seek
some
clarity
from
the
Minister
of
State
in
regard
to
the
registration
of
.ie
domain
name
which
be
not
hold
by
Irish
business
.
they
be
provide
service
into
Ireland
on
a
pretext
that
people
be
buy
from
a
Irish
website
.
if
that
service
be
be
procure
from
third
country

what
rights
have
the
consumer
in
the
context
of
procure
from
a

that
domain
be
not
register
in
Ireland

I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
bring
the
legislation
before
we
.
he
will
be
very
much
aware
of
online
fraud
,
in

,
with

of

I
welcome
this
Bill
as
a
comprehensive
leap
forward
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
can
reassure
we
that
the
requisite
personnel
will
be
put
in
place
in
the
statutory
agency
that
will
regulate
this
space
,
such
as
ComReg
and
the
CCPC
,
that
will
give
consumer
great
confidence

I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division
on
amendment
no.
1
to
the
motion
on
affordable
housing
.
in
the
short
time
that
I
have
,
there
be
many
point
that
I
wish
to
cover
.
I
want
to
start
with
the
BRIDE
project
,
which
will
be
familiar
to
many
people
who
be
concerned
with
biodiversity
and
partnership
with
the
agriculture
and
farming
sector
.
this
be
a
project
situate
in
north
County
Cork
.
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
visit
the
project
on
Monday
last
with
the
Labour
Party
leader
,
deputy
Ivana
Bacik
.
I
want
to
express
my
gratitude
to
Donal
Sheehan
,
Sinéad
Hickey
and
all
of
the
team
there
for
facilitate
we
in
what
be
a
great
learning
environment
and
a
wonderful
tutorial
.
the
model
be
a
very
simple
one
.
it
be
a
result
-
base
demonstration
project
that
be
design
to
increase
the
quantity
and
quality
of
habitat
on
intensely
manage
farmland
.
that
be
the
key
phrase
-
''
intensely
manage
farmland
''
.
the
project
be
locate
in
the
River
Bride
valley
of
north
County
Cork
and
it
will
explore
a
innovative
implementation
of
a
result
-
base
approach
for
wildlife
habitat
or
intensively
manage
farmland
.
it
aim
to
improve
biodiversity
and
environmental
awareness
on
intensive
Irish
farmland
,
reward
environmental
performance
and
highlight
this
nationally
.
it
be
also
there
to
facilitate
market
reward
for
sustainability
.
I
raise
this
because
it
be
part
of
a
European
innovation
project
which
be
fund
by
the
Department
.
it
have
key
partner
,
which
include
the
local
authority
,
Glanbia
,
Teagasc
,
Bord
Bia
,
the
National
Biodiversity
data
Centre
,
Kepak
and
Birdwatch
Ireland
.
I
hope
it
will
continue
to
be
fund
as
its
funding
line
run
out
at
the
end
of
this
year
,
as
I
understand
it
,
and
I
hope
the
minister
will
have
the
good
sense
to
continue
to
support
it
.
I
believe
the
42
farm
holding
that
be
involve
in
this
,
which
be
of
vary
size
and
have
different
offering
in
term
of
what
they
produce
,
form
a
key
model
.
when
the
new
CAP
come
in
,
particularly
in
regard
to
design
Pillar
ii
instrument
under
the
agri-environment
climate
measure
scheme
,
I
believe
this
be
a
key
project
that
would
plug
into
that
Pillar
ii
objective
.
if
we
can
get
farmer
to
devote
10
%
of
they
landholding
for
nature
without
lose
income
and
if
scheme
can
be
devise
,
such
as
the
bride
project
,
which
encourage
and
nudge
farmer
through
a
process
of
inspection
to
implement
more
environmental
goods
,
such
as
riparian
goods
,
grassland
margin
,
hedgerow
,
increase
biodiversity
and
so
forth
,
it
will
have
a
massive
impact
.
farmer
be
not
encourage
in
the
current
cap
to
give
more
to
that
margin
on
they
landholding
because
there
be
a
penalty
for
that
.
that
be
self
-
evident
,
as
we
all
know
.
if
the
minister
can
create
a
scheme
use
the
bride
project
as
a
model
,
by
which
he
would
design
a
agri-environmental
climate
measure
so
that
the
farmer
or
landholder
do
not
lose
income
but
,
in
fact
,
gain
income
through
a
process
as
devise
through
this
innovation
partnership
,
and
that
be
scale
up
,
scale
out
and
translate
throughout
the
country
,
the
minister
would
find
that
many
farmer
would
buy
into
it
.
we
be
increasingly
lose
biodiversity
.
that
be
self
-
evident
and
we
all
acknowledge
it
.
the
way
to
get
farmer
back
into
manage
the
countryside
be
to
ensure
there
be
a
financial
incentive
.
the
beautiful
thing
about
the
BRIDE
project
be
that
it
provide
financial
incentive
.
where
somebody
implement
sustainable
or
biodiversity
measure
,
there
be
a
mark
scheme
.
the
mark
scheme
determine
the
amount
of
money
the
person
will
gain
,
so
income
be
be
generate
for
the
farmer
.
I
will
leave
it
at
that
.
I
hope
the
project
will
continue
to
be
fund
and
I
would
love
the
BRIDE
project
to
be
plug
into
the
next
cap
under
the
Pillar
2
agri-environment
climate
measure
scheme
that
will
be
devise
.
that
would
be
a
good
thing
for
this
country
and
the
minister
would
find
many
farmer
would
participate
in
it
.
on
the
issue
of
forestry
,
there
have
be
many
repeat
promise
in
respect
of
forestry
growth
in
this
country
.
we
know
the
environmental
benefit
with
regard
to
sequestration
.
however
,
despite
the
repeat
promise
to
forest
owner
,
they
be
still
only
get
half
the
licence
require
to
meet
the
Department
's
target
.
it
be
just
not
enough
for
the
sector
.
be
we
get
any
close
to
have
licence
issue
within
a
acceptable
timeframe
of
120
day
?
the
answer
currently
be
"
no
"
.
second
,
be
we
go
to
meet
we
target
for
2022
?
we
plant
2000
ha
in
2021
,
but
it
appear
from
look
at
the
metric
that
we
will
end
up
with
few
than
2000
ha
for
2022
.
I
wish
there
be
a
great
sense
of
urgency
about
the
potential
of
the
forestry
sector
to
deliver
.
we
still
do
not
have
what
I
would
call
a
fit
-
for
-
purpose
ash
dieback
scheme
.
we
talk
about
the
great
game
of
hurl
but
,
and
I
have
raise
this
in
the
House
previously
,
there
have
be
no
progress
that
I
can
see
on
the
ash
dieback
scheme
.
forestry
be
one
of
the
sector
that
can
deliver
much
for
we
as
a
island
.
there
have
to
be
a
great
degree
of
political
imperative
put
behind
the
forestry
sector
to
make
sure
we
achieve
the
growth
target
that
be
necessary
to
sustain
the
sector
.
as
I
state
,
the
work
be
at
a
advanced
stage
.
I
know
that
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Noonan
,
be
recruiting
a
additional
120
ranger
,
which
be
double
what
be
there
in
2020
.
therefore
,
there
be
a
lot
of
good
work
ongoing
in
this
space
.
I
be
loath
to
interrupt
the
Taoiseach
but
we
must
maintain
the
speak
time
.
the
deputy
have
one
minute
leave
.
have
the
minister
's
Department
engage
in
research
in
respect
of
the
need
to
devise
a
disability
-
related
payment
to
deal
with
the
effect
of
long
Covid
?
I
acknowledge
the
existence
of
the
Covid
-
19
enhance
illness
benefit
payment
and
that
it
will
be
in
place
until
the
end
of
June
2022
.
my
reason
for
raise
this
be
that
we
seek
clarity
as
to
whether
there
will
be
continuity
of
that
payment
and
,
second
,
give
that
there
be
now
a
clinical
recognition
of
the
effect
of
long
Covid
,
whether
the
Department
be
respond
to
that
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
she
response
.
if
I
interpret
she
correctly
,
I
can
understand
she
retain
the
status
quo
because
the
nature
of
the
illness
benefit
be
clearly
define
in
term
of
what
a
person
must
do
to
meet
the
criterion
.
however
,
what
be
happen
now
in
this
country
,
and
there
be
robust
clinical
evidence
for
this
,
be
that
hospital
such
as
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
in
the
South
/
South
West
Hospital
Group
have
set
up
or
be
in
the
process
of
establish
long
Covid
clinic
.
that
will
be
replicate
throughout
the
country
.
if
somebody
move
from
the
enhance
illness
benefit
onto
the
illness
benefit
,
that
be
for
a
period
of
two
year
.
the
issue
be
the
period
thereafter
.
some
people
will
not
qualify
for
a
invalidity
pension
.
the
presentation
of
the
illness
they
present
with
,
even
though
it
have
be
determine
that
they
have
long
Covid
from
a
clinical
point
of
view
,
may
not
be
a
presentation
that
be
prescribe
under
the
term
of
the
Department
's
policy
.
that
be
why
I
be
raise
this
.
it
be
the
long
game
I
be
play
here
-----
-----
because
there
will
have
to
be
a
recognition
of
long
Covid
as
a
qualifying
condition
.
the
answer
to
my
question
be
"
no
"
;
that
be
the
short
answer
the
minister
be
give
.
I
acknowledge
that
but
I
will
continue
to
bang
the
drum
on
this
.
I
be
worried
that
there
be
a
statistically
significant
cohort
of
person
who
ordinarily
will
go
from
the
enhance
payment
to
illness
benefit
,
the
clock
will
tick
down
the
two
year
and
then
they
potentially
will
fall
off
the
cliff
if
they
be
not
eligible
to
move
onto
a
invalidity
or
long
-
term
payment
,
as
devise
by
the
Department
.
the
worry
I
have
for
that
people
be
that
the
department
might
be
too
stringent
in
how
it
apply
rule
and
the
criterion
that
they
must
meet
for
illness
benefit
payment
.
I
merely
ask
the
minister
to
carry
out
some
early
stage
research
,
perhaps
with
the
Department
of
Health
and
the
HSE
,
for
instance
,
to
see
how
long
Covid
be
affect
people
who
ordinarily
would
be
back
in
the
workplace
,
but
who
,
for
very
valid
clinically
indicate
reason
base
on
a
determination
that
it
be
due
to
long
Covid
,
will
not
be
back
in
the
workplace
any
time
soon
.
that
be
the
people
I
be
think
of
.
it
be
the
medical
certification
.
if
the
medical
certification
say
long
Covid
,
then
that
should
suffice
.
I
thank
the
minister
.
I
be
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
raise
this
issue
.
the
people
of
Youghal
be
very
exercise
about
the
decision
of
the
Court
Service
to
close
a
service
that
be
vital
to
people
and
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
Youghal
,
particularly
as
it
relate
to
the
victim
of
domestic
violence
.
as
my
colleague
,
deputy
Stanton
,
say
,
this
be
about
ensure
that
we
do
not
force
woman
who
be
subject
to
domestic
violence
and
who
be
seek
protection
order
to
go
from
Youghal
to
Cork
.
this
decision
take
a
service
further
away
from
the
people
who
be
most
vulnerable
and
most
in
need
of
it
.
I
ask
the
government
to
please
intervene
with
the
Court
Service
to
reverse
this
absolutely
disgraceful
decision
.
it
be
disgraceful
give
the
fact
that
the
Court
Service
invest
approximately
€
1.2
million
in
create
this
facility
in
the
first
instance
back
in
2008
.
we
have
testimonial
from
three
notable
solicitor
-
David
Keane
,
John
Brosnan
and
Karen
O'Shea
-
who
be
legal
representative
in
the
town
of
Youghal
.
they
be
on
the
public
record
as
say
that
this
be
a
Trojan
horse
for
get
rid
of
the
court
in
Youghal
itself
.
we
ask
the
government
to
please
reconsider
this
decision
and
to
use
its
good
office
to
intervene
with
the
Court
service
to
ensure
that
the
service
people
be
entitle
to
as
of
right
be
provide
.
person
must
have
good
administration
of
justice
without
impediment
.
you
cannot
create
a
situation
where
vulnerable
woman
who
be
subject
to
domestic
violence
will
have
to
get
on
bus
to
go
to
anglesea
Street
in
Cork
.
it
be
absolutely
disgraceful
.
I
respect
the
Minister
of
State
and
the
fact
she
do
not
have
policy
responsibility
for
this
area
.
the
response
by
the
government
be
not
adequate
for
the
purpose
of
ensure
the
administration
of
justice
,
as
articulate
by
the
concern
outline
by
the
law
officer
in
Youghal
,
by
the
user
of
the
service
and
by
the
citizen
.
we
be
in
a
situation
where
a
service
be
be
take
away
,
even
though
more
than
€
1
million
have
be
invest
.
to
throw
the
health
and
safety
argument
back
at
woman
who
have
suffer
the
indignity
and
hurt
of
domestic
violence
be
a
weak
response
.
I
do
not
personalise
that
comment
in
any
way
.
I
have
receive
the
same
email
as
my
colleague
,
deputy
Stanton
.
it
state
:
when
we
seek
this
protection
order
,
we
be
utterly
break
.
we
have
be
gaslighted
,
manipulate
,
intimidate
,
financially
abuse
,
sexually
abuse
,
physically
abuse
,
lie
to
,
cheat
on
,
isolate
from
we
friend
and
family
-
the
list
go
on
.
we
be
leave
question
we
sanity
,
ask
ourselves
,
"
what
be
wrong
with
I
?
"
we
have
to
protect
that
woman
and
that
service
.
I
agree
we
must
protect
that
woman
.

Stanton

as

say
,
the

already
adjudicate

I
see
no

there
should

in

reason
the

outline

the

should

there
should
be

give

scenario
that
might
arise
in

the
child
,
we
should
ensure
the
child
's
interest
be
serve
in

wide
possible
means
that
be
allowable
.
the
amendment
speak
to
that
need
specifically
and
I
thank
the

for
bring
it
forward
.
I
must
now
deal

a

no.
1
in
the
name
of
the
Minister
for
Health
to
the
motion
regard
strike
action
by
the
Medical
Laboratory

Association

today
,
on
the
question
,
"
that
the

"
,
a
division
be
claim
,
and
that
division
must
be
take
now
.
I
welcome
and
support
the
motion
.
I
will
start
by
respond
to
the
minister
's
response
to
the
point
that
be
raise
in
the
motion
about
the
establishment
of
a
discretionary
fund
.
it
be
true
to
say
that
the
community
welfare
service
make
discretionary
payment
and
nobody
would
argue
against
that
.
what
worry
I
,
however
,
be
the
fact
that
the
number
of
people
who
be
receive
payment
be
not
very
high
,
especially
with
regard
to
exceptional
need
payment
and
urgent
need
payment
.
in
a
response
I
receive
directly
from
the
minister
,
I
be
tell
that
in
2021
,
more
than
2300
exceptional
need
payment
amount
to
€
750000
be
make
to
assist
with
household
bill
and
heating
cost
.
to
the
end
of
March
of
this
year
,
some
780
exceptional
need
payment
amount
to
€
167000
have
be
make
across
the
entire
State
to
assist
with
household
bill
and
heating
cost
.
most
of
we
in
this
House
have
be
around
a
long
time
.
we
all
deal
with
CWOs
and
the
Department
of
social
Protection
but
something
be
not
computing
in
respect
of
the
volume
of
figure
I
have
share
.
I
have
notice
a
trend
in
the
past
five
or
six
year
,
while
also
note
the
excellent
work
that
individual
cwo
do
for
they
client
,
service
user
and
people
who
come
to
they
,
in
exercising
they
discretion
.
we
do
not
have
the
exact
evidence
for
my
assertion
yet
but
one
hope
one
's
political
gut
hopefully
serve
one
well
.
a
centralise
tendency
be
creep
into
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
which
be
try
to
reduce
the
number
of
payment
that
be
go
out
under
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
or
through
exceptional
need
payment
and
urgent
need
payment
.
person
's
access
to
that
payment
be
be
suppress
.
that
be
not
happen
at
CWO
level
,
but
when
deal
with
people
who
come
to
my
office
,
I
find
I
be
more
often
ring
the
0818
number
.
there
be
increasingly
a
suppression
of
that
human
interaction
between
the
person
who
be
apply
and
the
decide
officer
.
the
point
be
that
I
believe
strongly
that
the
Department
be
by
stealth
try
to
take
the
discretionary
element
out
of
that
key
payment
.
we
agree
they
exist
but
we
also
agree
,
now
we
be
all
interact
with
each
other
again
,
that
we
need
to
go
back
to
a
model
whereby
people
can
have
a
walk
-
in
service
.
that
be
what
we
be
talk
about
.
we
want
the
walk
-
in
service
to
be
resume
.
we
need
the
element
of
discretion
to
be
embed
into
the
structure
again
.
I
do
not
understand
why
application
be
more
often
go
up
the
line
to
somebody
who
have
no
relationship
whatsoever
with
the
applicant
or
have
not
have
a
human
interaction
with
the
applicant
.
it
run
contrary
to
the
foundation
of
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
as
it
be
establish
by
former
deputy
Frank
Cluskey
all
that
year
ago
.
we
need
to
go
back
to
that
.
there
be
unmet
demand
out
there
.
person
find
it
difficult
to
engage
directly
and
increasingly
we
,
as
deputy
,
be
interface
to
try
to
contextualise
people
's
individual
story
.
we
all
know
what
the
story
be
.
we
know
exactly
where
people
be
struggle
.
it
be
well
evidence
at
this
stage
and
be
plain
for
everybody
to
see
.
it
be
not
just
people
who
depend
on
the
Department
of
social
Protection
for
they
income
who
be
struggle
.
the
working
poor
be
also
struggle
.
we
need
to
find
some
mechanism
,
through
scheme
such
as
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
,
for
example
,
to
provide
for
a
great
number
of
urgent
need
payment
.
I
be
pore
over
number
.
in
October
2021
,
24
urgent
need
payment
be
make
,
if
the
figure
I
receive
in
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
be
to
be
believe
and
we
take
the
figure
provide
by
the
Department
absolutely
at
face
value
.
in
November
,
36
such
payment
be
make
.
in
December
,
38
be
make
.
in
January
,
26
be
make
.
in
February
,
25
be
make
.
in
March
,
there
be
a
upward
spike
to
45
.
that
be
the
figure
for
urgent
need
payment
,
which
be
a
specific
category
.
that
number
worry
I
.
I
can
conclude
there
be
a
deliberate
suppression
in
the
number
of
people
who
be
apply
and
refuse
payment
.
we
do
not
have
that
figure
but
they
will
come
out
in
due
course
,
I
be
sure
,
when
the
right
question
be
ask
.
the
alternative
conclusion
be
that
the
level
of
discretion
have
be
take
away
.
neither
God
nor
man
could
convince
I
that
in
March
only
45
people
throughout
the
country
apply
specifically
for
urgent
need
payment
.
that
be
base
on
a
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
receive
lately
.
if
I
be
misquote
figure
,
somebody
will
correct
I
.
I
be
happy
to
be
correct
,
but
I
have
the
information
here
in
black
and
white
.
we
keep
raise
the
issue
of
the
fuel
allowance
and
access
to
it
.
I
know
it
be
not
the
most
important
topic
during
this
summer
month
.
however
,
it
will
not
be
long
until
we
be
into
the
autumn
and
winter
month
again
and
the
issue
will
be
high
on
the
political
agenda
.
I
have
call
previously
in
this
house
for
some
sort
of
scheme
to
be
put
in
place
for
certain
people
.
while
it
be
acknowledge
that
there
have
be
a
increase
in
the
fuel
allowance
for
that
in
receipt
of
it
,
there
be
a
whole
category
of
people
who
have
work
all
they
life
,
put
child
through
college
and
be
live
in
C-
,
d-
and
E
-
rate
house
.
they
do
not
have
access
to
grant
and
do
not
have
the
means
to
upgrade
they
house
,
but
they
could
very
well
do
with
a
additional
supplementary
payment
for
fuel
.
if
the
government
be
to
create
a
second
category
to
encapsulate
that
people
who
have
a
modest
occupational
pension
or
a
contributory
pension
and
who
do
not
meet
the
criterion
for
access
to
the
fuel
allowance
,
it
would
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
very
many
of
the
people
to
whom
I
refer
,
because
they
be
of
a
certain
age
,
would
have
vote
Fianna
Fáil
historically
.
it
would
be
a
fair
assessment
to
extrapolate
that
they
have
probably
turn
away
from
Fianna
Fáil
but
maybe
Fianna
Fáil
could
go
back
and
look
at
that
category
of
people
,
if
at
all
possible
.
I
urge
the
Green
Party
and
Fine
Gael
to
do
the
same
because
this
be
all
come
into
sharp
relief
at
a
time
when
there
be
a
fuel
crisis
.
that
be
a
very
obvious
thing
to
say
but
if
it
be
possible
to
create
a
second
category
for
the
fuel
allowance
that
would
encapsulate
far
more
people
,
that
would
give
they
just
a
little
bit
of
headroom
and
see
they
through
the
next
winter
.
the
same
minister
of
State
be
in
the
House
the
last
time
I
raise
this
during
the
debate
on
a
previous
motion
.
I
hope
to
address
the
line
minister
with
policy
responsibility
for
this
in
due
course
as
well
.
we
have
to
look
after
that
people
.
they
make
the
big
sacrifice
in
this
country
in
the
1970
and
1980
when
they
pay
big
money
in
taxation
and
still
they
be
able
to
educate
child
and
put
they
through
college
.
I
be
probably
a
product
of
that
system
,
dare
I
say
it
.
I
support
the
motion
.
it
be
a
worthwhile
motion
but
we
must
look
again
at
the
role
of
the
community
welfare
officer
.
we
need
to
buttress
that
facility
.
the
community
welfare
officer
that
I
deal
with
know
the
people
they
be
deal
with
well
.
they
know
the
personality
and
they
be
embed
within
they
community
.
the
level
of
discretion
they
have
be
paramount
and
be
key
to
protect
people
and
we
need
to
go
back
to
that
,
back
to
the
well
.
I
want
to
get
the
perspective
of
the
minister
on
she
late
interaction
with
the
mobile
phone
and
broadband
task
force
.
do
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
O'Brien
,
attend
the
meeting
as
well
?
the
minister
,
deputy
Humphrey
,
be
here
and
she
attend
the
meeting
,
so
I
be
not
sure
why
she
be
not
answer
the
question
.
I
understand
.
the
minister
be
share
the
load
.
I
accept
that
.
I
apologise
.
two
key
point
arise
from
that
deliberation
.
one
be
the
point
about
improve
outdoor
mobile
phone
coverage
.
I
acknowledge
that
a
lot
have
be
achieve
in
the
key
output
of
the
previous
task
force
of
improve
mobile
phone
coverage
in
rural
area
and
in
urban
blackspot
.
as
more
and
more
people
be
take
the
modal
shift
in
transport
from
private
car
travel
into
train
and
bus
travel
,
we
must
ensure
blackspot
be
address
,
in
particular
on
the
railway
line
,
for
instance
,
between
Cork
and
Dublin
,
which
be
a
service
people
use
.
be
such
service
be
consider
in
term
of
ensure
we
have
complete
100
%
coverage
?
I
think
we
all
acknowledge
the
work
.
we
also
acknowledge
that
the
coverage
of
mobile
telephony
could
be
improve
.
there
be
still
some
well
-
note
blackspot
.
we
all
know
of
they
within
we
constituency
.
if
we
could
find
some
mechanism
where
we
as
public
representative
could
notify
somebody
who
be
involved
in
the
task
force
of
this
specific
blackspot
,
we
would
be
serve
we
constituent
well
in
that
regard
.
I
refer
specifically
to
the
Cork
to
Dublin
railway
line
,
where
there
be
significant
blackspot
,
and
I
wonder
if
that
could
be
address
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
could
take
that
message
back
,
I
would
be
most
grateful
.
I
take
that
point
on
board
.
there
be
very
important
issue
raise
by
the
deputy
that
we
have
to
address
.
the
processing
time
of
individual
loan
can
legitimately
vary
.
there
may
be
specific
information
require
to
confirm
eligibility
or
creditworthiness
,
depend
on
the
fact
of
the
case
.
there
may
be
delay
in
the
transaction
that
be
not
under
the
control
of
the
local
authority
,
but
I
accept
that
there
may
be
some
variation
in
processing
time
across
local
authority
.
I
agree
with
you
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
,
that
this
need
to
be
address
.
I
will
ask
my
department
to
look
into
the
concern
deputy
Colm
Burke
have
raise
this
evening
.
it
be
really

we
do
so
.
the
last
thing
we
want
be
to
inhibit
family
from
take
up
the
important

to
be
able
to
purchase
a
home

there
be
a

conflict
go
on
in
my
mind
in

of
this
Bill
because
while
one
be
minded
to
support
it
,
the
fact
be
that
so
much
appear
to
be
leave
out
or
have
not
come
under
great
scrutiny
prior
to
its
publication
and
promulgation
here
within
the
House
.
member
feel
they
be
be
rush
into
support
legislation
they
believe
may
not
adequately
address
the
entirety
of
the
issue
,
as
articulate
by
previous
speaker
.
we
feel
as
if
we
be
be
rush
into
a
process
.
while
recognise
the
importance
of
the
legislation
,
we
believe
it
be
be
rush
for
reason
of
political
expediency
at
this
stage
.
we
be
ask
ourselves
,
why
the
rush
now
?
why
not
take
a
little
more
time
to
consider
the
issue
therein
so
we
can
be
sure
we
can
all
support
the
Bill
and
have
a
very
clear
and
clean
conscience
when
do
so
?
there
be
a
paper
that
be
a
very
useful
and
objective
critique
of
the
Bill
before
we
.
it
be
from
the
Centre
for
Disability
Law
and
Policy
at
the
National
University
of
Ireland
,
NUI
,
Galway
.
I
will
quote
directly
from
it
because
it

the
concern
I
have
.
I
will
openly
admit
to
not
have
the
ability

properly
,
and
not
fully
have
the
skill
set
require
of
I
as
a
member
to
be
able
to
interrogate
every
dot
and
every
line
of
this
legislation
.
I
wish
for
more
time
to
learn
more
about
what
it
be
we
be
expect
to
pass
.
I
openly
admit
I
be
no
specialist
in
this
area
of

I
would
have
like
more

I

of

down
through

whose
perspective
we
all
inherently
appreciate
and
understand

we
have
all
try
to
advocate
on
she

and
that
of

Ms

have
also
express
serious
concern
about
this

.
I
will
read
into
the

some
correspondence
I
have
receive
from

:
dear
Sean
we
meet
on
27th
April
last
when
Justice
for
Wards
hold
a
meeting
outside

Dáil
to
highlight
we
concern
related
to

matter
.
I
have
since
write
to
you
concern
we
request
to
meet
with
the
Minister
for
Justice
[
I
know
the
Minister
of
State
will
tell
we
this
do
not
come
under
the
Department
of
Justice
but
the
Department
of
Health
,
which
we
accept
]
to
discuss
that
concern
with
a
view
to
have
they
resolve
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
decision
support
service
and
discharge
of
ward
.
there
be
people
from
all
part
of
the
country
involve
,
include
you
own
area
and
because
of
they
unique
circumstance
many
cannot
go
public
with
this
so
as
not
to
identify
ward
.
we
would
be
grateful
for
a
response
.
this
be
the
other
side
of
the
coin
,
so
to
speak
.
we
be
engage
on
two
front
-
ensure
that
the
legislation
underpin
the
dss
and
related
area
be
appropriate
and
ensure
that
the
dss
be
fit
for
purpose
.
there
have
be
no
engagement
with
Justice
for
Wards
,
Wards
of
Court
or
they
family
by
either
the
Office
of
Wards
of
Court
or
the
decision
support
Service
.
many
family
have
no
idea
what
be
happen
and
if
the
online
joint
presentation
direct
at
Wards
and
they
family
yesterday
be
any
indication
of
the
type
of
communication
,
engagement
and
information
we
be
go
to
get
,
it
demonstrate
how
out
of
touch
they
be
with
this
people
and
they
concern
,
need
and
understanding
of
this
change
.
many
do
not
have
internet
or
resource
to
engage
.
that
be
also
a
point
worth
bear
in
mind
and
be
a
genuine
perspective
.
Ms
Mary
Farrell
further
correspond
with
I
on
25
May
,
when
she
send
I
a

again
,
it
be
a
outline
of
she
concern
that
I
will
read
into
the
record
:
dear
minister
O'Gorman
I
be
write
to
you
as

for
Justice

to

we
concern
...
[
that

the
draft

act
2015

have
be
present
for
you
approval
by
the
decision
support
service
.
in
short
,
we
believe
the
draft
code
be
not
fit
for
purpose
and
should
not
be
publish
in
they
current
form
,
and
we
urge
you
not
to
approve
this
draft
for
publication
until
significant
change
have
be
make
.
member
of
Justice
for
Wards
have
be
campaign
for
change
to
the
archaic
Wardship
system
for
many
year
-
since
the
State
sign
the
UNCRPD
in
2007
to
the
eventual
signing
of
the
assisted
decision
-
make
(
Capacity
)
Act
2015
.
we
now
know
that
the
finish
line
be
to
be
a
long
way
off
for
that
who
be
lock
into
the
Wardship
system
for
they
lifetime
with
no
route
out
.
this
matter
have
rumble
on
for
...
too
long
,
with
delay
at
every
turn
,
and
now
,
after
7
year
,
the
decision
support
service
's
code
of
practice
be
of
concern
.
[
I
be
merely
read
into
the
record
the
perspective
of
somebody
who
be
directly
involved
with
this
.
I
will
appreciate
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
]
the
consultation
process
for
the
Draft
code
be
not
fully
accessible
to
,
or
meaningfully
inclusive
of
,
people
directly
affect
by
this
law
-
include
and
particularly
the
current
main
stakeholder
,
ward
of
Court
,
they
committee
and
family
;
disabled
people
;
people
with
intellectual
disability
;
people
with
experience
of
mental
health
service
;
neurodivergent
people
and
old
people
.
the
period
for
which
the
Draft
code
be
open
for
public
consultation
be
too
short
,
submission
be
only
permit
in
write
format
,
and
the
questionnaire
be
not
make
available
in
alternative
format
such
as
easy
to
read

this
inaccessible
consultation
have
be
criticise
by
the
Oireachtas
committee
on

,
Equality
,
disability
,
integration
and
youth
in
its
pre-legislative
scrutiny
report
on

have
be
no
engagement
by
the
Office
of
Wards
of
Court
or
the
decision
support
Service
with
Wards
,
they
family
or
committee
.
this
be
very
concerning
.
it
do
not
bide
well
for
future
communication
.
the
content
of
the
draft
code
be
not
compatible
with
Ireland
's
obligation
under
human
rights
law
,
specifically
the
UN
Convention
on
the
Right
of
Person
with
Disability
.
in
we
view
,
the
draft
code
do
not
accurately
represent
the
spirit
and
letter
of
the
assist
decision
-
make
(
capacity
)
act
,
which
be
intend
to
give
people
more
choice
and
control
over
they
decision
-
making
,
not
less
.
in
a
number
of
place
the
draft
code
give
the
impression
that
a
wide
range
of
individual
(
include
legal
professional
,
financial
professional
and
healthcare
professional
)
can
assess
a
person
's
capacity
under
the
act
,
when
in
fact
the
act
make
clear
that
only
the
court
be
empower
to
declare
a
person
to
lack
capacity
.
the
core
human
rights
value
of
respect
for
the
will
and
preference
of
the
person
,
which
be
hard
-
fight
for
in
the
2015
Act
[
and
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
have
already
refer
]
,
be
not
sufficiently
prioritise
across
the
draft
code
,
and
there
be
little
to
no
guidance
to
that
act
in
role
under
the
act
on
how
to
discover
,
interpret
,
and
act
upon
,
the
person
's
will
and
preference
.
we
have
try
to
engage
with
the
decision
support
service
but
we
effort
have
not
be
well
receive
.
the
decision
support
Service
have
not
produce
any
document
as
a
result
of
the
public
consultation
outline
the
key
message
receive
and
propose
action
as
a
result

we
know
that
people
have
be
wait
a
long
time
for
reform
of
Ireland
's
capacity
law
,
especially
ward
and
they
family
but
to
press
ahead
with
the
publication
of
this
code
without
meaningful
engagement
with
people
directly
affect
by
this
law
,
will
ultimately
be
counterproductive
for
everyone

.
we
once
again
urge
you
not
to
approve
this
draft
code
when
present
to
you
,
and
to
request
the
decision
support

at
a
minimum
:
-
Publish
the
key

to
make

yours
sincerely
Mary
Farrell
spokesperson
Justice
for
Wards
of
Court
arise
from
the
intervention
I
have
just
make
,
could
some
form
of
communication
be
open
up
with
Justice
for
Wards
of
Court
?
if
only
to
intervene
or
engage
with
the
group
on
its
concern
,
that
would
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
that
be
my
only
request
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
be
grateful
for
she
intercession
in
that
regard
.
I
be
genuinely
delighted
that
she
have
undertake
to
do
that
.
she
know
the
group
-
its
member
be
reasonable
and
decent
people
.
if
they
could
just
get
some
qualitative
engagement
with
the
process
,
it
would
be
a
first
step
.
although
I
have
a
few
minute
leave
,
I
do
not
want
to
tarry
for
too
long
except
to
say
that
the
member
of
Justice
for
Wards
of
Court
feel
that
they
have
be
jettison
by
the
process
and
do
not
feel
a
part
of
it
.
if
we
ensure
that
they
be
include
,
it
would
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
I
anticipate
that
the
minister
will
reject
the
amendment
,
but
I
do
not
understand
why
.
when
the
minister
be
in
opposition
,
he
and
I
serve
on
the
joint
committee
arise
from
the
citizen
's
Assembly
in
respect
of
climate
action
.
the
minister
be
very
strong
in
he
rhetoric
on
the
whole
issue
of
just
transition
.
if
I
recall
correctly
,
the
Green
Party
produce
a
Bill
on
the
principle
of
the
just
transition
.
we
be
all
broadly
in
agreement
and
we
need
to
insert
the
principle
in
legislation
.
the
amendment
before
we
be
a
sound
amendment
in
what
it
seek
to
achieve
.
deputy
O'Rourke
already
refer
to
the
Scottish
example
which
have
be
well
signal
.
I
do
not
see
why
we
could
not
follow
suit
or
at
least
seek
to
have
this
principle
insert
across
a
plethora
of
legislation
which
be
go
through
this
House
.
it
should
be
embed
firmly
across
legislation
in
a
way
that
ensure
we
be
act
appropriately
in
respect
of
climate
action
.
I
see
no
reason
the
House
should
reject
a
amendment
of
this
nature
.
it
seem
to
be
eminently
sensible
.
forgive
I
if
I
misunderste
the
minister
.
I
would
have
think
that
this
be
the
most
appropriate
place
in
which
to
promulgate
idea
such
as
we
propose
amendment
.
all
too
often
we
do
not
give
ourselves
enough
credit
for
discuss
deeply
issue
such
as
this
.
many
of
we
,
include
the
minister
,
have
seek
to
emb
this
in
legislation
.
we
now
have
a
golden
opportunity
in
this
legislation
to
do
that
.
while
I
accept
it
be
important
to
coalesce
with
that
who
be
outside
this
House
,
it
be
also
important
to
take
the
view
of
people
within
this
House
seriously
.
I
welcome
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
in
bring
forward
this
amendment
as
a
genuine
attempt
to
deal
with
the
issue
therein
.
on
the
issue
of
person
who
be
seek
to
reduce
they
waste
,
especially
people
who
have
particular
need
,
for
instance
,
with
incontinence
,
in
2017
there
be
a
government
decision
on
the
need
to
introduce
a
waste
waiver
in
that
regard
.
we
have
not
see
this
yet
.
it
be
the
subject
of
a
amendment
here
.
if
we
be
serious
about
ensure
we
include
everybody
,
I
believe
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
Bill
to
deal
with
that
issue
also
.
in
bring
forward
further
legislation
,
which
the
minister
say
he
intend
to
do
as
thing
change
,
I
ask
that
we
would
give
due
recognition
to
people
who
require
waiver
and
who
have
no
way
of
reduce
they
waste
because
of
medical
issue
.
I
ask
that
we
recognise
that
people
and
that
consideration
be
give
to
the
introduction
of
the
waste
waiver
.
it
be
a
government
decision
of
2017
.
I
should
know
whether
government
decision
fall
when
the
mandate
fall
.
I
do
not
think
they
do
but
I
will
be
guide
by
the
Ceann
Comhairle
.
it
be
a
government
decision
regardless
of
who
be
in
government
.
I
hope
this
could
be
revisit
.
I
be
certainly
try
to
put
it
into
the
mind
of
the
minister
.
there
be
people
who
would
have
reasonably
expect
a
scheme
for
waive
fee
for
some
household
waste
collection
service
for
the
benefit
of
household
where
,
by
reason
of
medical
illness
or
disability
,
include
a
illness
or
disability
that
give
rise
to
the
need
for
incontinence
wear
,
a
disproportionate
amount
of
household
waste
be
present
for
collection
.
the
purpose
of
such
a
waiver
would
be
to
give
recognition
to
that
people
and
transpose
the
government
decision
into
legislation
.
I
too
welcome
this
amendment
.
it
set
out
a
very
clear
strategy
.
I
will
speak
very
briefly
about
electronic
equipment
.
the
minister
will
be
aware
of
the
"
right
to
repair
"
movement
,
which
be
gather
a
head
of
steam
globally
.
this
apply
to
all
of
we
and
we
personal
consumption
,
particularly
of
electronic
goods
and
white
goods
such
as
smartphone
.
the
concept
of
build
-
in
obsolescence
be
become
quite
painful
for
consumer
.
it
be
annoying
that
we
cannot
have
recourse
to
repair
for
a
product
we
have
purchase
.
the
minister
will
say
we
do
not
want
to
move
ahead
of
EU
law
in
relation
to
harmonisation
rule
.
I
anticipate
he
reply
and
I
appreciate
that
dynamic
but
we
should
take
due
cognisance
of
this
movement
around
the
right
to
repair
.
on
this
small
little
island
,
we
be
sit
on
mountain
of
electronic
detritus
.
it
be
the
same
detritus
that
20
year
ago
we
would
have
seek
to
repair
,
for
example
,
a
toaster
,
dishwasher
or
phone
.
person
be
sick
to
the
back
tooth
of
this
build
-
in
obsolescence
and
have
to
replace
goods
annually
or
biannually
.
it
be
just
not
good
enough
.
if
we
can
be
the
first
country
in
the
world
to
move
head
of
the
European
Union
,
we
should
be
that
radical
and
ambitious
.
if
we
can
instil
within
circular
economy
legislation
this
concept
of
the
right
to
repair
,
allow
independent
business
to
repair
product
make
by
the
likes
of
Apple
,
Samsung
and
so
on
,
we
should
seek
to
embrace
that
.
I
hope
that
concept
will
be
instil
within
the
subsection
that
deal
specifically
with
electronic
equipment
.
I
move
amendment
no.

to

amendment

what
be
the
status

no.

?
be
it
not
in
good
order

I
welcome
this
debate
and
I
welcome
the
engagement
of
the
minister
.
although
I
be
come
to
the
Bill
at
a
late
stage

I
appreciate
that
the
minister
have
seek
to
engage
seriously
with
the
deliberation
that
take
place
on
Committee
stage
and
reflect
they
on
this
stage
.
the
issue
I
wish
to
repeat
be
build
-
in
obsolescence
,
particularly
in
electronic
goods
.
if
the
minister
take
away
one
thing
tonight
to
bring
to
the
Council
of
Minister
meeting
he
attend
,
it
be
that
we
must
have
some
form
of
critique
of
the
capitalist
model
that
take
away
from
the
consumer
the
right
to
repair
something
such
as
a
iPhone
.
equally
,
consumer
must
not
be
bind
into
contract
in
a
way
that
give
the
whip
hand
to
Apple
,
Samsung
or
any
of
this
big
global
conglomerate
.
arguably
,
give
the
current
model
we
have
in
Europe
,
they
have
great
traction
with
the
European
Commission
than
perhaps
a
Council
of
Minister
might
have
.
if
strong
minister
at
the
Council
push
back
against
this
big
conglomerate
in
a
way
that
protect
the
citizen
and
consumer
of
Europe
,
so
that
citizen
have
that
right
to
repair
build
in
as
a
principle
,
they
would
be
do
a
very
good
day

raise

bar

fund

as
it
relate

will
tell

be
work

open

this

be
set

flow

this
be
money
that
could

ensure

can
be
bring

allow

to
at

tooth

storm
that

Brexit

have

IFPEA

it
tell
I
six
large

be
now
exclude

capital
investment
scheme
result
from

this
be
completely
wrong

contrary

principle
of
the
Brexit

,
where
no
one
be
leave
behind

the
six
project
earmark

would
have
a
massive
positive
impact
in
they
respective
community
and
would
also
be
real
driver
for
change
within
the
fishing
industry
,
create
new

great
value

would

as
a
member
state
,
Ireland
should
be
highlight
and
push
forward
project
such
as
this
as

to
the
current
approach
where
the
fund
be

.
the
Minister
of
State
may
refer
to
the
issue
of
state
aid
rule
in
she
reply
.
when
he
visit
Killybegs
in
September
2021
,
the
commissioner
for
fishery
say
that
there
be
no
state
aid
rule
and
we
have
absolute
flexibility
to
prioritise
we
funding
.
we
could
open
that
up
to
large
producer
and
bring
they
under
the
scheme
as
well
.
that
flexibility
be
key
to
ensure
there
be
a
successful
scheme
.
the
large
company
themselves
can
grow
the
number
of
employee
they
have
.
there
be
the
issue
of
sub
-supply
of
plant
and
machinery
into
the
sector
under
the
capital
expenditure
element
.
contractor
be
ready
,
willing
and
able
to
provide
service
.
they
be
all
wait
for
news
of
this
scheme
.
increasingly
they
be
become
frustrate
by
the
fact
that
the
scheme
be
not
up
and
run
and
that
the
manner
in
which
the
scheme
be
devise
exclude
large
processor
.
I
be
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
take
that
on
board
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
when
the
scheme
be
be
set
up
,
there
be
a
interaction
with
the
task
force
and
discussion
on
this
issue
.
my
understanding
be
that
the
recommendation
of
the
seafood
task
force
be
to
support
all
sector
of
the
industry
equally
because
no
sector
of
the
Irish
fishing
industry
escape
the
negative
impact
of
the
Brexit
deal
.
Enterprise
Ireland
interven
at
the
task
force
to
outline
where
flexibility
exist
and
how
state
aid
would
permit
support
to
the
non-SME
sector
,
similar
to
what
occur
during
Covid
.
it
be
self
evident
at
the
task
force
meeting
that
some
people
within
the
Department
have
a
ideological
difficulty
with
the
State
support
certain
sector
of
the
fishing
industry
even
though
the
European
Commission
clearly
permit
it
and
actively
encourage
it
.
the
evidence
of
that
be
the
statement
of
the
fishery
commissioner
to
which
I
refer
.
in
addition
,
we
have
the
remark
of
Elisa
Ferreira
,
the
Commissioner
for
Cohesion
and
Reforms
,
who
state
:
in
move
forward
,
we
do
not
want
to
leave
anyone
behind
.
the
funding
that
Ireland
will
receive
will
contribute
to
improve
living
standard
,
support
economic
growth
in
the
country
and
mitigate
the
negative
impact
in
local
community
.
that
be
fishing
and
coastal
community
.
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
we
want
to
see
the
money
flow
.
money
need
to
start
flow
into
that
community
and
into
processing
,
along
with
provide
real
-
time
support
for
a
sector
that
all
present
will
agree
have
take
a
hammering
as
a
result
of
Brexit
.
we
do
not
want
to
be
create
bureaucratic
entanglement
that
prevent
money
from
flow
into
the
community
that
so
badly
need
it
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
time
for
a
reply
.
before
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Butler
,
leave
,
I
wish
to
acknowledge
that
both
she
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Rabbitte
,
to
be
fair
to
they
,
have
go
out
and
meet
the
people
involve
and
tackle
this
issue
head
on
and
they
be
not
sit
behind
they
desk
in
they
Department
.
on
that
basis
,
before
she
leave
,
I
want
to
acknowledge
the
work
she
be
do
.
I
also
raise
the
issue
of
the
St.
Francis
welfare
home
in
Fermoy
,
which
be
redesignate
during
the
pandemic
as
a
transitional
care
facility
.
my
understanding
be
that
it
be
to
close
temporarily
.
I
just
want
to
raise
that
with
the
Minister
of
State
and
acknowledge
she
work
before
she
leave
.
I
be
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
to
support
the
motion
put
forward
by
the
independent
Group
.
it
be
a
vital
motion
and
I
be
glad
the
government
be
not
oppose
it
.
it
have
come
to
my
attention
that
recruitment
seem
to
be
at
the
heart
of
this
issue
.
we
keep
be
tell
by
the
HSE
and
the
government
that
the
lack
of
personnel
to
meet
the
demand
be
one
of
the
basic
issue
.
I
have
receive
response
to
parliamentary
question
about
this
.
I
ask
the
government
how
much
it
be
spend
on
recruitment
via
the
HSE
,
that
be
,
money
be
give
to
recruitment
company
to
recruit
the
talent
that
be
require
to
meet
demand
,
particularly
in
respect
of
respite
,
which
be
the
subject
of
this
motion
.
for
2020
and
2021
,
€
12
million
be
hand
over
to
recruitment
company
to
sort
this
issue
.
what
be
we
spend
the
money
on
?
where
be
the
value
for
money
?
why
be
it
that
they
have
not
succeed
in
recruiting
the
staff
we
need
to
meet
the
demand
of
people
in
this
sector
who
so
badly
need
the
service
?
we
need
to
start
audit
and
question
the
amount
of
money
be
spend
by
the
HSE
.
it
have
spend
€
12
million
in
the
last
two
year
on
recruitment
company
to
recruit
staff
.
I
be
be
objective
here
but
no
one
could
argue
that
we
be
get
value
for
money
with
that
kind
of
spend
.
if
we
be
,
we
would
have
the
staff
in
place
to
meet
the
need
.
the
one
issue
I
be
constantly
raise
be
that
of
Cooleens
House
,
which
be
under
the
ambit
of
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
.
I
be
be
tell
month
in
,
month
out
and
week
in
,
week
out
,
that
recruitment
be
at
the
heart
of
the
issue
and
that
the
centre
cannot
be
reopen
to
allow
people
to
avail
of
the
service
because
it
cannot
recruit
the
require
staff
.
one
can
only
accept
that
answer
for
so
long
.
if
we
be
spend
€
12
million
,
surely
to
goodness
that
money
,
wherever
it
be
be
deploy
,
could
find
somebody
to
be
able
to
reopen
that
facility
.
a
person
in
charge
be
require
.
on
top
of
that
,
there
be
a
Darwinian
competition
go
on
whereby
the
HSE
be
take
staff
away
from
section
38
and
39
organisation
.
the
HSE
be
compete
with
voluntary
organisation
for
staff
,
which
the
HSE
be
responsible
for
provide
in
the
first
instance
.
Cooleens
house
be
like
every
other
respite
facility
throughout
the
country
.
I
only
use
that
example
because
it
be
one
I
be
familiar
with
.
we
need
to
grasp
the
nettle
in
respect
of
the
recruitment
issue
.
for
two
year
now
we
be
be
tell
the
issue
be
recruitment
and
that
we
cannot
recruit
the
staff
.
I
do
not
think
we
be
buy
that
anymore
.
we
have
be
quite
patient
and
people
have
understand
that
there
be
a
recruitment
issue
but
it
be
time
for
we
to
start
drill
down
and
get
into
the
weed
of
why
we
cannot
recruit
staff
in
a
way
that
meet
the
demand
and
the
need
of
people
who
be
affect
.
speaker
after
speaker
have
say
that
family
be
come
to
we
as
deputy
and
Senator
say
they
cannot
get
respite
care
for
they
love
one
.
when
we
question
why
that
be
,
we
be
tell
it
be
because
we
do
not
have
enough
staff
in
the
system
.
we
need
to
start
drill
down
into
why
that
be
and
how
we
can
justify
spend
€
12
million
.
the
government
,
through
the
HSE
,
have
spend
€
12
million
in
the
last
two
year
give
money
to
recruitment
agency
.
what
be
they
do
for
that
money
?
that
be
the
question
.
I
welcome
this
motion
.
as
I
say
,
I
be
glad
the
minister
be
not
oppose
it
.
there
be
also
the
issue
of
pay
parity
between
section
39
organisation
and
the
HSE
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
have
have
meeting
with
the
National
Federation
of
voluntary
Bodie
,
FEDVOL
,
in
respect
of
that
and
I
understand
that
around
€
20
million
be
need
.
the
reason
I
be
raise
that
issue
be
that
there
be
two
cohort
of
people
who
be
effectively
do
the
same
job
but
because
of
a
different
governance
structure
,
one
set
of
worker
be
pay
less
than
the
other
.
tackle
that
issue
would
go
some
way
towards
solve
the
problem
of
recruitment
.
we
need
a
bit
of
energy
around
this
piece
of
it
.
it
be
not
fair
at
a
time
like
this
.
I
will
go
back
to
Cooleens
House
.
when
I
question
the
Minister
of
State
about
Cooleens
House
,
she
note
that
it
have
six
room
and
provide
enormous
capacity
for
respite
in
north
Cork
.
she
acknowledge
that
the
challenge
of
recruiting
a
person
in
charge
be
what
be
prevent
it
from
be
reopen
.
I
support
the
motion
.
I
be
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
but
we
need
to
start
look
at
the
recruitment
issue
.
it
have
be
throw
back
at
we
as
the
reason
for
the
delay
or
the
inability
to
provide
service
.
we
be
not
accept
it
anymore
as
a
reason
.
it
can
be
solve
.
the
HSE
must
be
question
and
interrogate
more
on
how
it
can
justify
that
kind
of
spend
at
a
time
when
people
be
cry
out
for
service
.
you
party
will
be
boss
soon
enough
.
I
thank
deputy
Nash
for
share
he
time
.
I
wish
to
refer
to
flood
alleviation
work
and
the
challenge
people
face
when
they
seek
to
purchase
insurance
in
area
where
Office
of
Public
Works
,
OPW
,
flood
mitigation
project
have
already
be
complete
.
I
specifically
refer
to
the
Munster
Blackwater
in
town
like
Fermoy
and
Mallow
,
as
well
as
place
in
Cork
city
where
we
do
not
yet
have
full
opw
scheme
under
way
,
where
there
be
a
massive
difficulty
on
the
part
of
business
and
resident
to
acquire
insurance
.
when
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
be
in
opposition
,
he
put
forward
the
Flood
Insurance
Bill
2016
.
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
be
to
ensure
that
people
who
work
,
reside
or
have
business
in
area
where
flood
relief
scheme
be
implement
would
be
able
to
get
insurance
cover
.
I
understand
that
Bill
die
when
the
last
mandate
end
.
I
make
no
apology
in
say
I
will
now
bring
that
Bill
forward
,
line
for
line
,
in
my
name
.
we
will
put
it
to
the
test
and
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
if
a
member
of
Fianna
Fáil
do
not
put
forward
the
same
Bill
in
the
intervene
period
,
in
which
case
I
would
be
very
happy
to
yield
,
I
will
put
forward
that
Bill
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
to
test
the
theory
that
Fianna
Fáil
will
be
serious
about
ensure
that
people
who
live
in
area
where
flood
alleviation
work
have
be
carry
out
will
be
able
to
get
that
cover
.
while
I
be
speak
about
flood
alleviation
work
and
the
OPW
,
that
scheme
in
Fermoy
cost
€
30
million
.
it
be
a
fine
scheme
.
a
incident
take
place
there
on
21
February
last
year
,
when
a
small
number
of
premise
be
adversely
affect
and
be
flood
.
the
owner
of
that
premise
have
yet
to
receive
any
kind
of
compensation
or
report
in
respect
of
what
take
place
there
.
this
be
relevant
to
the
insurance
issue
because
when
incident
like
this
occur
,
where
relief
work
do
not
work
completely
and
there
be
a
breakdown
somewhere
,
and
where
we
do
not
have
sight
of
the
report
in
respect
of
Fermoy
,
it
feed
into
the
narrative
from
the
insurance
company
that
they
do
not
have
to
cover
this
town
where
work
have
be
carry
out
.
it
strengthen
they
hand
.
I
be
hopeful
,
in
put
forward
the
Flood
Insurance
Bill
that
,
as
I
say
,
a
member
of
Fianna
Fáil
or
the
government
will
come
forward
and
now
promulgate
this
Bill
,
which
be
initiate
by
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Michael
McGrath
.
if
they
do
so
,
I
will
happily
withdraw
my
Bill
.
we
will
test
the
government
on
that
to
see
if
it
be
serious
about
provide
flood
insurance
cover
in
that
area
.

by
mother
and
baby
home
survivor
have
now
be
abandon
by
the
government
.
"
I
understand
that
the
minister
be
speak
directly
to
a
motion
in
respect
of
the
creation
of
the
office
of
director
of
authorise
intervention
in
respect
of
Tuam
.
however
,
this
would
have
be
the
first
opportunity
since
this
news
break
in
August
for
the
minister
to
make
some
utterance
to
the
House
in
respect
of
why
the
promise
independent
review
of
testimony
have
now
be
abandon
.
for
many
people
,
whether
in
Tuam
,
Bessborough
,
or
wherever
,
that
be
the
kernel
of
the
issue
right
now
.
they
feel
deeply
traumatise
by
the
fact
that
the
independent
review
be
not
now
go
to
take
place
.
it
be
for
we
to
speak
for
that
people
.
it
be
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
ask
that
people
who
have
give
testimony
already
to
now
create
a
new
initiative
.
I
will
quote
from
the
minister
's
adviser
,
who
I
assume
issue
the
statement
.
it
read
:
have
consider
the
matter
,
the
minister
believe
that
a
new
initiative
to
support
survivor
to
tell
they
personal
story
,
so
that
it
can
be
formally
record
and
accept
as
part
of
the
official
record
,
provide
the
good
opportunity
for
respond
to
the
concern
of
survivor
in
a
meaningful
way
.
to
expect
a
person
who
have
already
give
evidence
to
now
submit
evidence
again
be
a
insult
to
that
people
.
I
cannot
for
the
life
of
I
see
how
the
creation
of
a
museum
or
a
national
centre
for
research
and
remembrance
will
have
the
confidence
of
that
very
people
who
have
give
evidence
and
who
feel
they
effort
and
the
sheer
trauma
they
have
to
go
through
to
tell
they
story
have
be
abandon
and
disregard
.
I
be
very
hopeful
that
we
be
on
a
pathway
with
this
process
and
that
by
at
least
put
in
place
a
independent
review
of
the
testimony
,
the
minister
would
have
repair
the
damage
do
and
people
would
have
move
in
the
same
direction
go
forward
.
until
such
time
as
that
issue
be
deal
with
and
confront
,
and
until
a
independent
review
be
carry
out
of
testimony
,
nobody
be
go
to
have
any
confidence
whatsoever
in
the
process
.
the
entirety
of
the
process
be
now
taint
.
I
be
hopeful
that
we
generation
of
politician
would
have
deal
with
this
head
-
on
.
when
we
be
in
the
national
convention
centre
I
say
I
hope
this
would
not
come
down
to
a
issue
of
money
and
resource
.
I
fear
now
that
that
be
where
this
be
at
.
I
be
fearful
that
the
minister
be
afraid
to
reopen
this
process
again
on
the
basis
of
resource
and
what
type
of
potential
litigation
might
take
place
as
a
result
of
the
reopening
of
such
a
process
.
I
do
not
think
we
should
be
so
cautious
.
we
should
be
the
generation
of
politician
that
deal
with
this
head
-
on
.
we
owe
a
duty
of
care
to
everybody
who
be
involved
in
this
issue
to
at
least
,
as
a
mark
of
respect
,
carry
out
the
independent
review
of
testimony
.
there
be
a
question
for
the
minister
in
respect
of
the
propose
memorandum
to
go
to
cabinet
.
as
a
institution
,
whether
on
the
floor
of
this
House
or
in
committee
,
we
need
to
provide
some
forum
where
the
minister
can
come
before
we
to
answer
question
about
why
a
process
to
create
that
independent
review
of
testimony
be
abandon
.
what
be
the
modality
of
that
?
this
be
unfinished
business
.
this
be
the
correct
chamber
to
raise
such
a
situation
.
it
be
important
for
the
deputy
's
constituent
to
be
aware
of
that
.
there
be
a
broad
issue
about
make
this
information
clear
to
family
in
that
situation
.
the
information
should
be
make
clear
on
the
form
and
at
point
of
contact
,
such
as
website
,
etc
.
perhaps
the
deputy
's
constituent
be
not
aware
of
it
.
I
hope
he
can
bring
it
to
she
attention
.
many
people
find
themselves
in
a
situation
of
marriage
breakdown
or
whatever
and
because
of
that
circumstance
be
deny
benefit
to
which
they
should
be
entitle
.
I
hope
the
response
will
provide
a
avenue
for
the
lady
in
question
and
she
family
.
I
again
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
the
matter
this
evening

hear
,
hear
.
the
minister
speak
early
about
the
merit
of
not
use
one
-
off
funding
for
day
-
to
-
day
measure
.
I
find
it
difficult
to
disagree
with
that
.
once
-
off
funding
can
be
use
for
capital
project
.
there
be
a
dire
need
for
transport
capital
project
in
particular
.
person
look
back
at
the
Celtic
tiger
and
say
that
at
least
we
get
road
out
it
.
if
this
be
a
boom
,
what
will
we
look
back
on
and
be
able
to
say
we
get
out
of
it
?
there
be
a
necessity
for
electricity
generation
capacity
in
this
country
.
we
can
import
as
much
French
nuclear
energy
as
we
want
but
we
will
import
it
at
whatever
cost
they
want
to
sell
it
.
there
be
simply
no
alternative
to
use
car
in
Ireland
.
the
idea
that
we
will
have
1
million
car
and
the
electricity
to
provide
for
they
by
2030
be
laughable
.
while
I
do
not
have
any
problem
with
put
money
aside
,
I
just
wonder
whether
some
of
it
should
be
spend
on
once
-
off
capital
funding
now
.
I
always
read
the
minister
's
speech
at
this
point
in
this
proceedings
because
I
believe
it
be
important
.
in
most
case
,
one
come
in
here
with
a
pre-prepared
speech
but
it
be
important
to
parse
the
word
of
the
minister
and
to
seek
to
interpret
they
.
his
speech
state
:
government
be
acutely
aware
that
while
public
servant
have
FEMPI
reverse
and
be
due
to
receive
further
pay
rise
under
the
extension
to
the
current
Public
service
agreement
,
Building
Momentum
,
that
work
in
community
and
voluntary
organisation
be
not
cover
by
this
arrangement
.
nor
be
they
cover
under
any
Public
service
agreement
negotiate
between
public
service
union
and
the
government
.
that
work
in
the
Community
and
voluntary
sector
be
not
public
servant
and
so
,
the
government
do
not
...
there
be
a
lot
of
not
and
nos
there
.
however
,
one
seek
to
be
positive
in
interpret
the
minister
's
word
.
the
speech
go
on
to
say
"
I
believe
a
process
along
this
line
could
play
a
useful
role
in
provide
solution
to
the
current
pay
related
issue
that
have
be
raise
,
and
which
be
reference
in
today
's
[
Labour
]
motion
.
"
this
statement
relate
to
further
engagement
by
the
WRC
.
I
hope
that
the
minister
be
today
send
a
signal
that
there
be
potentially
grounds
for
a
"
process
"
,
to
use
the
minister
's
word
,
to
be
devise
in
which
people
could
come
around
the
table
to
begin
to
deal
with
this
anomaly
that
exist
.
in
my
area
in
Cork
,
organisation
like
Enable
Ireland
and
the
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
operate
.
I
be
proud
to
join
they
in
Charleville
recently
where
speech
and
language
therapist
,
occupational
therapist
and
other
professional
be
roll
out
government
policy
.
the
government
establish
the
child
's
disability
network
team
and
expect
organisation
like
the
St.
Joseph
's
Foundation
and
enable
Ireland
to
deliver
on
that
policy
.
however
,
they
be
deliver
on
that
policy
with
one
hand
tie
behind
they
back
because
there
be
people
work
in
equivalent
grade
and
profession
,
that
be
,
speech
and
language
therapist
,
occupational
therapist
,
physiotherapist
and
so
on
,
who
be
work
in
the
HSE
and
have
good
term
and
condition
.
the
mandate
the
minister
talk
about
can
now
change
.
surely
government
policy
should
demand
that
,
if
we
be
to
roll
out
child
's
disability
network
team
and
if
that
be
a
function
of
government
policy
,
the
people
who
be
roll
they
out
should
have
equal
term
and
condition
of
employment
.
all
we
be
ask
for
today
be
for
government
to
devise
a
process
to
allow
trade
union
and
worker
's
representative
to
come
around
a
table
and
begin
the
change
we
all
acknowledge
be
need
.
the
mandate
need
to
change
and
it
be
time
for
it
to
change
so
that
there
will
be
equality
in
the
system
.
as
I
have
say
,
people
work
as
occupational
therapist
for
the
St.
Joseph's
Foundation
should
have
the
same
term
and
condition
as
people
work
in
the
HSE
.
it
be
as
simple
as
that
.
I
be
look
the
minister
straight
in
the
eye
now
and
I
hope
that
he
be
smile
because
he
government
will
come
up
with
a
process
.
that
be
all
we
be
ask
for
here
today
.
that
would
give
some
semblance
of
hope
to
the
many
people
we
be
seek
to
represent
.
we
welcome
the
Bill
and
the
clear
language
from
the
minister
in
respect
of
the
domestic
violence
provision
.
he
state
unequivocally
that
:
a
requirement
for
evidential
proof
that
a
person
have
be
victimise
could
serve
to
undermine
the
operation
of
the
legislation
.
consequently
,
for
the
initial
two
-
year
period
of
the
operation
of
the
leave
,
there
will
be
no
requirement
for
a
person
to
present
evidence
in
order
to
avail
of
the
leave
.
in
the
minister
's
response
,
he
may
tell
we
why
a
period
of
two
year
be
choose
.
it
seem
to
I
quite
a
arbitrary
period
of
time
.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
principle
apply
that
no
evidence
be
require
,
which
be
welcome
,
I
question
why
it
have
to
be
two
year
.
that
be
the
first
point
.
my
second
point
be
on
the
wait
period
of
26
week
and
the
flexibility
around
that
.
subsection
(
5
)
of
the
new
section
13b
state
:
for
the
purpose
of
this
section
,
where
a
employee
cease
to
be
the
employee
of
a
employer
and
,
not
more
than
26
week
after
the
date
of
cesser
,
the
employee
again
become
the
employee
of
the
employer
,
the
period
of
service
of
that
employee
with
that
employer
before
the
date
of
cesser
shall
be
deem
to
be
continuous
with
the
period
of
service
of
that
employee
with
that
employer
after
again
become
such
employee
.
I
be
try
to
fully
understand
what
that
mean
but
we
will
parse
it
in
the
come
week
and
certainly
before
committee
stage
.
the
minister
may
further
elucidate
that
point
.
read
the
language
of
the
Bill
,
what
come
across
to
I
be
that
there
be
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
say
"
no
"
versus
what
we
contend
be
the
requirement
to
ensure
the
employee
's
right
to
access
such
leave
be
embed
in
the
legislation
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
of
what
be
in
the
minister
's
head
and
where
he
stand
.
be
I
look
at
the
constituent
part
of
the
government
,
I
imagine
the
Green
Party
might
be
more
in
favour
of
the
rights
of
the
employee
,
whereas
Fine
Gael
and
probably
some
element
of
Fianna
Fáil
would
probably
say
there
need
to
be
great
flexibility
as
regards
the
ability
of
the
employer
to
say
"
no
"
.
I
just
want
to
get
a
sense
of
where
the
government
be
come
from
.
I
say
that
because
the
grounds
for
refusal
outline
in
section
13D
seem
very
loose
.
we
will
seek
to
amend
this
grounds
if
we
perceive
that
the
arrangement
be
too
loose
and
the
Bill
,
in
attempt
to
transpose
the
EU
legislation
,
do
not
fully
vindicate
the
rights
of
the
employee
.
why
have
a
cut
-
off
age
of
12
year
,
as
provide
for
in
section
13b
(
3
)
?
where
a
child
be
in
receipt
of
a
long
-
term
illness
payment
,
for
instance
,
he
or
she
qualify
up
to
the
age
of
16
year
.
I
respectfully
contend
that
the
age
of
12
and
16
year
be
unrealistic
and
premature
cut
-
off
point
.
we
will
seek
to
amend
that
provision
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
outline
he
perspective
on
they
.
there
be
so
many
family
in
Ireland
where
fertility
and
miscarriage
arise
.
the
silence
surround
that
be
one
of
the
hard
thing
for
family
when
they
go
through
fertility
treatment
or
where
miscarriage
arise
.
this
be
open
to
further
examination
but
I
understand
that
around
14000
woman
experience
miscarriage
each
year
and
approximately
one
in
six
couple
experience
fertility
issue
.
not
all
require
or
want
treatment
but
for
the
many
who
do
,
we
must
ensure
that
the
appropriate
workplace
leave
be
available
.
we
will
propose
some
amendment
to
meet
that
requirement
because
it
be
high
time
we
as
a
society
acknowledge
that
miscarriage
exist
.
there
be
the
beginning
of
a
great
openness
around
the
conversation
about
miscarriage
but
it
would
be
good
if
we
legislate
for
a
requirement
in
society
that
people
could
have
leave
in
that
circumstance
.
where
a
employer
be
compassionate
,
there
be
never
a
issue
around
this
matter
but
not
every
employer
be
compassionate
.
the
Bill
the
Labour
Party
publish
in
March
last
year
,
which
would
provide
20
day
'
leave
for
woman
who
experience
early
miscarriage
,
with
a
additional
ten
day
pay
time
off
for
worker
who
wish
to
access
reproductive
healthcare
treatment
such
as
ivf
,
be
a
sensible
solution
.
if
the
minister
would
respond
to
that
shortly
,
I
would
welcome
that
.
we
will
certainly
seek
to
amend
this
legislation
to
recognise
the
fact
that
people
require
leave
for
miscarriage
and
fertility
treatment
.
that
would
be
the
hallmark
of
a
progressive
society
be
we
to
do
that
.
the
minister
mention
New
Zealand
,
which
receive
global
praise
for
introduce
pay
time
off
for
people
in
the
workplace
who
experience
a
miscarriage
.
it
would
be
a
great
victory
for
woman
and
family
if
we
be
to
follow
suit
.
I
also
note
the
specific
provision
on
breast
-
feeding
which
we
fully
welcome
.
I
stand
here
as
a
man
about
to
hit
the
age
of
50
but
I
have
a
very
young
family
.
I
have
a
five
-
year
-
old
,
a
three
-
year
-
old
and
a
little
girl
who
be
bear
in
July
,
so
I
know
something
of
this
matter
.
I
note
the
minister
make
specific
reference
to
the
Green
Party
motion
tab
by
Senator
Pauline
O'Reilly
in
the
Seanad
today
propose
to
introduce
lesson
in
school
on
breast
-
feeding
.
I
would
be
far
more
satisfied
,
as
I
think
we
all
would
,
if
there

throughout

State

some
€
1.58
million
be
provide
to
hire
24
lactation
consultant
.
it
be
all
well
and
good
tabling
motion
in
the
Seanad
,
and
they
be
laudable
in
they
own
right
,
but
there
be
a
responsibility
on
the
Green
Party
in
this
regard
.
while
it
do
not
control
the
health
portfolio
,
there
be
a
collective
responsibility
on
the
government
to
ensure
that
lactation
consultant
be
hire
.
that
would
have
a
massive
impact
on
family
who
need
that
advice
.
it
cost
over
€
100
for
a
private
consultant
's
advice
and
not
many
can
afford
that
.
where
there
be
issue
around
breast
-
feeding
,
it
be
very
easy
for
people
to
become
discourage
if
they
do
not
have
access
to
a
public
healthcare
service
which
do
not
have
the
require
24
consultant
.
it
be
government
policy
to
roll
out
that
24
lactation
consultant
position
at
a
cost
of
€
1.58
million
.
it
be
incumbent
on
the
Green
Party
,
Fine
Gael
and
Fianna
Fáil
to
make
sure
they
do
everything
to
recruit
that
consultant
into
the
system
.
that
issue
be
pertinent
to
this
Bill
.
I
will
leave
it
there
.
I
have
raise
specific
issue
around
the
rights
of
the
employee
versus
the
flexibility
that
I
read
across
this
legislation
in
the
tone
of
its
language
,
which
seem
to
I
to
tilt
the
balance
of
power
towards
the
employer
.
that
need
to
be
address

the
Taoiseach
might
address
the
deputy
's
question
.
I
again
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
the
matter
.
I
will
bring
he
concern
and
view
back
to
the
minister
.
as
I
outline
,
it
be
important
any
decision
make
with
regard
to
seasonal
clock
change
take
account
of
the
wide
impact
this
change
would
make
.
the
Department
of
Justice
's
engagement
with
the
public
have
show
the
people
be
keenly
aware
of
this
impact
.
the
government
have
introduce
a
number
of
target
measure
in
budget
2023
to
increase
energy
efficiency
,
such
as
increase
the
funding
to
the
good
energy
,
warm
home
scheme
.
this
will
allow
homeowner
on
low
income
to
upgrade
the
energy
efficiency
of
they
home
.
the
small
firm
investment
in
energy
efficiency
scheme
will
provide
a
grant
to
company
to
encourage
capital
investment
in
project
to
reduce
carbon
emission
.
the
€600
energy
credit
for
household
and
the
temporary
business
energy
support
scheme
will
also
assist
in
reduce
the
impact
of
the
increase
cost
of
energy
.
the
Department
of
Justice
will
continue
to
engage
at
EU
level
on
the
issue
of
seasonal
clock
change
and
ensure
Ireland
's
interest
be
take
into
account
throughout
the
decision
-
making
process
.
the
deputy
be
right
to
say
we
need
to
conserve
energy
.
his
proposal
sound
very
reasonable
to
I
.
if
all
the
country
in
Europe
,
the
UK
and
the
island
of
Ireland
be
to
jump
together
,
we
would
have
a
good
chance
.
the
war
in
Ukraine
have
bring
huge
challenge
.
I
will
not
say
huge
opportunity
but
there
be
area
where
we
can
try
to
conserve
energy
.
it
be
vital
.
I
be
watch
the
EirGrid
dashboard
every
day
.
as
a
politician
,
one
hope
the
wind
blow
as
much
as
possible
and
that
it
remain
relatively
mild
,
but
there
be
challenging
time
ahead
.
I
commend
the
Acting
chairman
on
she
running
of
proceedings
and
keep
we
all
on
time
.
I
support
the
motion
and
be
glad
it
have
be
tab
by
the
social
Democrat
.
I
note
the
motion
put
forward
by
that
party
on
24
February
2021
,
to
which
the
Labour
Party
tab
a
amendment
relate
to
medical
card
.
the
amendment
be
accept
and
the
motion
,
as
amend
,
agree
to
by
the
House
.
the
amendment
call
on
the
government
to
issue
a
enhance
medical
card
to
all
survivor
who
present
to
mother
and
baby
home
for
any
length
of
time
,
include
while
pregnant
or
on
a
post-natal
basis
.
that
motion
have
be
pass
by
the
Dáil
.
with
the
announcement
of
the
scheme
,
there
now
seem
to
be
a
rowing
back
on
that
democratic
position
that
be
take
.
in
the
context
of
the
publication
of
the
question
and
answer
document
relate
to
the
mother
and
baby
institution
payment
scheme
,
it
be
important
that
we
convey
to
people
that
the
scheme
be
not
up
and
run
and
that
it
require
the
mother
and
Baby
Institution
payment
Scheme
Bill
2022
to
be
pass
before
it
come
into
operation
.
many
deputy
be
be
contact
by
people
who
think
the
scheme
be
up
and
run
and
it
be
important
that
a
message
go
out
to
clarify
that
it
be
not
yet
in
operation
.
the
publication
of
the
question
and
answer
paper
have
give
the
impression
that
the
scheme
be
in
place
.
there
be
a
need
to
clarify
for
the
public
,
especially
survivor
,
that
it
be
not
yet
in
existence
.
like
everybody
else
,
I
be
perplexed
as
to
why
there
be
such
a
arbitrary
cut
-
off
point
with
regard
to
baby
below
six
month
of
age
.
I
can
only
surmise
that
the
minister
and
the
Department
have
put
some
quantifiable
monetary
value
on
the
cost
of
compensation
or
redress
that
would
significantly
increase
the
overall
cost
beyond
€
800
million
that
be
allocate
.
I
can
think
of
no
other
reason
the
government
would
act
in
such
a
arbitrary
way
in
respect
of
baby
aged
less
than
six
month
.
the
minister
state
:
the
commission
recommend
a
scheme
in
which
6500
people
would
benefit
,
at
a
total
cost
of
€400
million
.
we
have
go
substantially
beyond
that
.
the
proposal
contain
in
the
State
scheme
will
benefit
34000
people
,
at
a
total
cost
of
€800
million
.
some
19000
former
resident
will
receive
enhance
medical
card
.
if
I
be
interpret
the
scheme
correctly
-
I
be
open
to
correction
in
that
regard
-
the
minister
be
say
that
for
mother
who
spend
less
than
three
month
in
a
mother
and
baby
home
or
a
county
home
institution
it
be
€
5000
,
for
mother
who
spend
between
three
and
six
month
it
be
€
10000
,
and
there
be
then
a
€
1500
work
payment
for
mother
who
qualify
in
that
regard
.
that
mean
the
total
amount
for
that
who
qualify
for
the
general
payment
and
the
work
payment
be
€
11500
.
what
I
be
try
to
convey
,
possibly
awkwardly
,
be
that
I
do
not
understand
the
quantum
for
baby
between
birth
and
six
month
and
whether
there
be
a
value
put
on
that
.
when
I
say
"
value
"
,
I
be
ask
whether
the
government
kick
the
tyre
from
a
financial
perspective
when
it
be
do
the
financial
calculation
and
come
up
with
a
figure
of
€
800
million
.
how
much
extra
would
it
have
cost
the
State
to
include
baby
between
birth
and
six
month
?
I
be
not
a
accountant
and
I
do
not
want
to
sound
like
one
.
ultimately
,
the
point
I
be
make
be
that
the
fact
that
a
person
spend
a
period
in
one
of
this
institution
should
,
morally
and
ethically
,
be
sufficient
for
the
person
to
,
at
least
,
be
give
some
recognition
by
way
of
redress
for
that
period
.
the
minister
will
present
he
Bill
in
the
week
of
26
October
.
there
be
still
a
sword
of
Damocles
hang
over
we
in
the
context
of
the
testimony
of
people
who
present
to
the
confidential
committee
.
respectfully
,
that
have
not
yet
be
fully
address
by
the
minister
.
he
have
state
previously
that
he
be
go
to
create
a
archive
but
it
add
insult
to
injury
if
people
who
have
present
to
the
confidential
committee
be
now
be
tell
that
testimony
will
be
archive
and
house
elsewhere
.
there
must
be
all
sort
of
difficulty
in
respect
of
the
general
datum
protection
regulation
,
gdpr
,
and
the
ethics
or
lack
of
ethics
when
it
come
to
take
all
of
that
information
and
put
it
into
a
archive
without
go
back
to
each
person
who
present
to
that
confidential
committee
.
they
rightly
feel
aggrieved
that
they
testimony
be
not
treat
with
the
respect
it
deserve
.
there
be
issue
in
that
regard
that
still
need
to
be
deal
with
in
the
context
of
the
Bill
that
will
be
bring
before
we
.
I
suspect
that
much
play
will
make
by
member
of
the
Opposition
in
respect
of
that
issue
because
we
cannot
hive
it
off
;
we
need
to
deal
with
it
face
on
.
we
in
opposition
have
consistently
say
that
we
generation
of
politician
need
to
deal
with
this
issue
as
comprehensively
as
possible
.
it
be
one
of
the
issue
that
must
be
address
.
the
issue
of
GSK
,
formerly
GlaxoSmithKline
,
have
not
yet
be
put
to
bed
either
.
Dare
I
deign
to
give
the
minister
advice
on
what
he
should
do
?
if
I
be
in
he
position
,
I
would
call
in
GSK
and
tell
the
company
that
it
need
to
do
more
than
apologise
.
I
refer
to
the
lack
of
ethics
show
.
this
company
still
exist
and
all
it
have
do
be
give
a
apology
.
there
would
be
a
moral
obligation
and
responsibility
on
any
pharmaceutical
company
to
deal
with
a
issue
such
as
this
.
in
the
context
of
the
vaccine
trial
alone
,
there
also
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
accountability
and
culpability
from
the
religious
institution
.
I
be
repeat
point
that
have
be
well
make
to
the
minister
.
he
will
be
acutely
aware
of
all
this
and
I
know
he
will
have
internalise
all
of
this
complexity
in
he
own
thinking
on
the
Bill
that
will
come
before
we
.
however
,
I
ask
he
not
to
forget
that
there
be
a
moral
obligation
on
company
such
as
GSK
,
particularly
where
they
be
IDA
Ireland
client
and
have
be
the
beneficiary
of
significant
support
from
the
State
through
the
year
.
they
have
a
moral
obligation
and
there
be
leverage
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
be
able
to
flex
its
muscle
in
that
regard
.
the
Labour
Party
support
the
motion
wholeheartedly
and
thanks
the
social
Democrat
-
I
nearly
say
"
the
Progressive
Democrat
"
-
for
bring
it
forward
.
there
be
ten
minute
leave
and
member
will
have
one
minute
each
.
I
call
deputy
Cathal
Crowe
.
my
sincere
apology
.
I
be
out
of
order
myself
.
there
be
very
little
time
leave
in
this
slot
.
please
,
forgive
I
.
I
apologise
.
if
I
may
,
as
acting
chair
,
intervene
at
this
point
in
time
.
there
be
a
long
-
standing
convention
in
the
House
as
I
understand
it
.
this
agenda
item
be
statement
on
the
European
Council
meeting
of
October
20
and
21
pursuant
to
standing
order
124
.
I
ask
all
member
present
to
confine
they
remark
to
this
particular
topic
.
it
do
not
help
the
House
if
member
be
barrack
each
other
.
it
serve
no
purpose
whatsoever
.
if
we
could
have
more
light
than
heat
in
the
debate
,
it
would
be
helpful
for
everybody
.
I
welcome
the

Mr.
Jonathan
Tobin
,
from
Youghal
,
County
Cork
,
be
currently
in
hospital
in
Greece
.
he
have
a
catastrophic
accident
on
29
July
last
.
his
family
now
want
to
bring
he
home
.
the
HSE
be
liais
with
he
family
,
and
both
Cork
University
Hospital
and
the
hospital
in
Greece
be
liais
with
each
other
.
we
be
now
try
to
get
the
HSE
to
use
its
discretion
under
the
treatment
abroad
scheme
to
get
a
air
ambulance
to
bring
he
home
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
please
intercede
with
the
HSE
to
bring
the
man
home
if
possible
.
I
welcome
that
the
government
will
not
oppose
this
Bill
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
minister
have
issue
with
some
of
the
way
the
legislation
be
lay
out
,
but
this
be
why
we
have
pre-legislative
scrutiny
;
it
be
there
to
iron
all
of
this
out
.
as
the
Opposition
,
we
do
not
have
the
service
of
the
Attorney
General
.
we
would
love
to
have
the
service
of
the
Attorney
General
when
draft
legislation
.
maybe
in
the
come
year
we
will
have
the
opportunity
ourselves
over
this
side
of
the
House
to
have
that
service
.
I
acknowledge
also
that
the
government
will
bring
forward
legislation
,
which
be
also
welcome
,
but
we
want
to
see
it
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
hope
the
commitment
to
publish
it
by
the
end
of
2022
be
meet
.
as
well
as
legislation
,
we
need
to
have
the
resource
in
we
community
so
we
can
combat
this
issue
to
begin
with
.
deputy
Paul
Donnelly
refer
to
small
classroom
in
DEIS
area
and
other
area
.
we
also
need
to
make
sure
that
we
fully
resource
we
drug
and
alcohol
task
force
.
I
be
a
director
of
the
Clondalkin
drug
and
alcohol
task
force
for
many
year
.
early
we
talk
about
crack
cocaine
.
there
be
so
many
time
we
have
chance
to
be
reactive
in
we
community
.
when
we
see
a
emerge
need
in
we
community
,
for
example
,
and
want
to
put
a
policy
or
measure
in
place
to
deal
with
that
,
we
could
not
because
we
do
not
have
the
resource
.
we
need
to
make
sure
that
we
have
the
resource
in
place
for
we
community
.
I
thank
all
deputy
for
a
lively
and
heartening
debate
.
powerful
contribution
be
make
on
this
side
of
the
House
.
this
be
honest
and
passionate
contribution
.
it
be
exactly
what
be
need
.
I
echo
the
call
for
a
citizen
's
assembly
on
drug
.
it
be
time
for
a
adult
conversation
.
we
talk
about
the
language
we
use
on
a
daily
basis
such
as
"
get
out
of
the
head
"
.
what
do
that
mean
?
it
mean
that
people
want
to
get
out
of
the
space
that
be
go
on
in
they
head
.
they
want
to
use
a
illicit
substance
.
they
want
to
do
something
that
will
take
they
away
from
themselves
.
that
be
what
drug
use
do
and
that
be
what
addiction
do
.
it
give
calm
to
that
anxious
inner
world
that
be
go
on
.
it
give
calm
to
the
underlying
reason
we
speak
about
of
trauma
poverty
.
that
be
what
it
do
.
we
need
to
tackle
the
underlying
reason
and
issue
.
I
have
work
in
many
drug
service
over
the
year
.
that
be
my
background
before
I
come
into
this
Chamber
.
one
of
the
place
that
stick
with
I
for
year
be
one
of
the
most
challenging
but
also
one
of
the
most
rewarding
.
it
be
a
role
I
have
when
I
be
work
with
under
18
-
year
-
old
in
a
area
of
Dublin
.
I
will
not
mention
the
specific
area
because
I
do
not
want
to
further
stigmatise
it
.
I
welcome
deputy
Ó
Ríordáin
into
the
project
when
he
be
a
minister
of
State
at
the
time
with
responsibility
for
the
national
drug
strategy
.
we
be
work
with
under
18s
.
if
I
have
say
to
that
young
lad
that
they
be
vulnerable
,
they
would
go
through
I
for
a
shortcut
.
that
be
the
last
thing
they
think
they
be
,
but
they
be
vulnerable
.
I
see
this
young
lad
and
work
with
they
.
I
helplessly
and
hopelessly
try
to
help
this
young
lad
.
I
could
see
in
front
of
my
eye
how
they
be
be
entice
into
criminality
by
old
and
more
experienced
drug
dealer
who
tell
they
,
"
hold
this
drug
for
we
and
whatever
drug
the
lad
be
use
you
will
get
you
touch
out
of
that
.
"
all
of
a
sudden
the
local
gardaí
would
get
a
call
and
this
young
kid
would
be
the
pawn
among
criminal
kingmaker
.
they
would
let
gardaí
know
that
this
kid
have
the
drug
,
maybe
just
to
get
themselves
off
the
hook
.
that
be
well
know
right
across
Dublin
.
this
young
kid
be
out
of
school
and
they
be
not
engage
in
employment
.
they
be
not
engage
in
anything
other
than
the
drug
they
be
use
and
the
drug
dealer
.
we
need
to
have
resource
in
place
so
we
can
tackle
that
.
I
be
a
individual
and
on
my
own
and
work
with
this
under
18s
.
that
be
my
role
.
I
be
on
my
own
try
to
deal
with
this
young
lad
.
we
see
some
good
outcome
but
we
also
see
some
not
so
good
outcome
.
unfortunately
,
we
lose
some
young
people
.
we
need
to
examine
the
underlying
issue
that
contribute
towards
make
this
lifestyle
look
attractive
.
again
,
it
be
a
escape
.
it
be
the
calm
in
a
anxious
world
.
get
out
of
the
head
be
a
escape
from
reality
that
this
young
people
be
in
.
Poverty
and
the
lack
of
opportunity
be
always
top
of
the
list
in
any
conversation
I
have
,
not
only
with
young
people
but
also
with
the
service
that
be
there
to
support
they
.
reference
be
always
make
to
intergenerational
drug
user
.
it
be
not
about
intergenerational
drug
use
;
it
be
about
intergenerational
poverty
and
trauma
that
we
deal
with
on
a
daily
basis
.
we
need
to
target
this
young
people
before
they
end
up
in
the
hand
of
drug
dealer
.
I
have
always
believe
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
lose
cause
.
I
have
work
with
people
right
across
the
spectrum
of
drug
use
over
the
year
.
some
of
they
have
have
chaotic
lifestyle
,
some
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
and
have
year
of
abstain
behind
they
,
and
everybody
in
between
.
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
lose
cause
.
we
use
to
have
to
work
on
logic
model
and
,
to
get
the
resource
for
the
drug
task
force
from
the
minister
,
we
have
to
do
tick
-
box
exercise
and
quantify
what
be
a
success
.
a
success
to
I
a
awful
lot
of
the
time
be
when
somebody
turn
up
the
next
morning
because
,
sometimes
when
they
be
leave
my
service
,
I
do
not
believe
they
would
get
through
the
night
.
it
be
hard
to
quantify
that
when
fill
out
hse
form
,
tick
box
,
work
on
logic
model
and
all
the
hoop
they
make
we
jump
through
.
the
child
be
vulnerable
in
this
,
as
be
the
drug
user
.
we
need
a
more
productive
way
of
deal
with
drug
user
.
direct
they
away
from
the
Judiciary
service
and
into
healthcare
and
recovery
service
have
to
be
the
way
forward
.
it
be
say
at
the
start
by
other
Deputy
,
probably
a
lot
good
than
I
be
say
it
,
that
the
citizen
's
assembly
on
drug
be
a
way
forward
on
that
.
I
thank
everybody
for
they
contribution
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
government
be
not
oppose
this
Bill
and
I
hope
it
get
to
the
stage
of
legislative
scrutiny
.
I
look
forward
to
see
what
the
government
have
propose
by
the
end
of
2022
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
please
finish
because
we
be
squeeze
for
time
.
I
thank
the
deputy
.
she
make
good
time
.
I
must
now
deal
with
a
postpone
division

last
night
,
as
I
be
sit
in
my
office
,
I
try
to
crystallise
my
thought
around
this
debate
.
there
be
so
much
information
for
we
to
analyse
that
it
be
hard
to
encapsulate
it
within
a
reasonably
short
debate
such
as
this
.
nonetheless
,
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
speak
in
the
debate
.
we
be
fortunate
as
deputy
that
there
be
many
people
outside
this
chamber
who
be
willing
to
provide
we
with
excellent
research
and
resource
.
as
I
sit
in
my
office
last
night
,
I
receive
a
email
contain
a
briefing
paper
on
the
Bill
from
the
Irish
Council
for
Civil
liberty
,
ICCL
.
with
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
permission
,
I
will
read
some
of
it
into
the
record
.
for
I
,
it
crystallise
all
the
issue
and
flaw
that
be
inherent
in
this
legislation
.
the
ICCL
paper
state
at
the
outset
:
1
.
survivor
challenge
the
final
report
of
the
mother
and
Baby
Home
Commission
of
investigation
in
the
high
Court
by
argue
that
the
commission
fail
to
adhere
to
the
legislation
that
establish
it
,
and
that
they
rights
under
the
constitution
and
the
European
Convention
on
human
Right
have
be
breach
.
a
settlement
be
reach
whereby
the
State
consent
to
a
declaration
that
the
commission
act
in
breach
of
statutory
duty
.
a
statement
be
also
agree
which
recognise
that
"
survivor
do
not
accept
the
account
give
in
the
final
report
...
as
a
true
and
full
reflection
of
the
oral
and
documentary
evidence
they
give
"
.
this
be
follow
by
a
list
of
64
paragraph
which
can
no
long
be
rely
on
.
the
State
have
express
that
the
Redress
Scheme
be
a
part
of
the
measure
be
use
in
"
respond
to
the
report
"
.
ICCL
be
concerned
that
the
Redress
Scheme
be
therefore
base
on
a
report
which
the
State
itself
agree
be
flawed
.
2
.
the
final
report
omit
survivor
's
testimony
and
draw
conclusion
that
do
not
align
with
survivor
's
testimony
.
for
example
:
a
)
there
be
"
no
evidence
"
that
the
woman
who
give
birth
be
deny
pain
relief
(
executive
summary
,
para
.
245
)
and
that
there
be
"
no
evidence
"
[
this
be
the
word
of
the
commission
report
]
that
at
the
time
of
adoption
woman
think
"
they
consent
be
not
full
,
free
and
inform
"
(
executive
summary
,
para
.
254
)
.
b)
mother
"
be
not
'
incarcerate
'
in
the
strict
meaning
of
the
word
"
c
)
certain
evidence
be
"
merely
the
product
of
a
creative
writing
class
"
.
this
be
the
atmosphere
in
which
we
be
seek
to
promulgate
this
legislation
.
the
ICCL
's
report
be
a
damning
one
.
on
the
propose
independent
review
,
it
state
:
on
2
June
2021
,
it
be
report
that
the
vast
majority
of
evidence
give
by
survivor
,
that
who
give
evidence
to
the
confidential
Committee
,
be
effectively
not
consider
for
the
final
report
.
this
lead
to
the
proposal
from
the
Department
of
Children
of
a
review
of
survivor
testimony
.
however
,
[
the
minister
]
recently
announce
[
and
this
be
quote
in
the
Irish
Examiner
,
thanks
to
the
work
of
Elaine
Loughlin
and
Conall
Ó
Fátharta
]
that
this
would
not
proceed
due
to
"
significant
legal
complexity
"
.
this
have
not
be
adequately
identify
.
problem
with
the
mother
and
Baby
Institution
payment
Scheme
Bill
2022
4
.
[
the
Bill
]
omit
over
40
%
of
survivor
,
include
child
who
spend
less
than
six
month
in
a
institution
and
that
who
be
board
out
.
the
six
-
month
requirement
be
arbitrary
and
permit
no
consideration
of
context
:
a
child
resident
for
180
day
receive
€
12500
.
a
child
resident
for
179
day
receive
...
[
nothing
at
all
]
.
5
.
the
Bill
make
it
more
difficult
for
survivor
who
reside
in
a
institution
at
a
young
age
to
claim
compensation
.
whereas
the
General
Scheme
of
the
Bill
[
which
the
committee
consider
]
allow
child
survivor
to
claim
a
payment
if
they
be
,
or
have
reasonable
grounds
for
suspect
they
be
,
resident
...
the
Bill
only
allow
a
child
to
claim
who
"
be
resident
"
[
very
specific
language
]
...
for
child
who
may
have
no
documentary
evidence
of
they
residence
,
this
set
the
standard
of
proof
too
high
.
6
.
the
Bill
provide
no
compensation
for
force
and
illegal
adoption
,
force
labour
,
unlawful
vaccine
trial
...
deputy
Funchion
have
refer
to
the
vaccine
trial
that
take
place
,
a
issue
that
have
be
raise
by
all
Opposition
Member
.
we
want
clarity
in
respect
of
GSK
.
we
have
be
very
adamant
about
that
.
it
look
to
I
like
GSK
have
be
let
off
the
hook
.
respectfully
,
the
Minister
and
the
State
have
not
adequately
address
the
issue
of
the
vaccine
trial
.
it
be
a
sword
of
Damocles
hang
over
we
and
it
need
to
be
address
.
6
.
the
Bill
provide
no
compensation
for
force
and
illegal
adoption
,
force
labour
,
unlawful
vaccine
trial
,
abuse
as
a
adopt
child
,
and
death
.
nor
do
the
Bill
provide
compensation
for
discrimination
whether
base
on
gender
,
disability
or
race
.
the
latter
issue
of
systemic
racism
in
institution
be
recently
highlight
as
a
serious
gap
in
this
Bill
by
UN
special
Rapporteurs
.
7
.
the
term
"
work
-
related
payment
"
use
by
the
Bill
...
do
not
adequately
describe
live
experience
.
it
should
properly
be
describe
as
"
force
labour
"
.
8
.
the
level
of
payment
provide
by
the
Bill
in
respect
of
the
"
work
-
related
payment
"
be
inadequate
.
they
must
correspond
to
the
wage
that
survivor
should
have
earn
at
the
time
and
be
link
to
the
average
industrial
wage
.
9
.
the
Bill
do
not
count
a
"
temporary
absence
"
of
180
day
or
more
...
there
be
no
room
for
context
.
a
survivor
may
have
excellent
reason
for
have
leave
the
institution
and
return
.
for
example
,
a
survivor
may
have
escape
for
181
day
before
be
catch
and
return
.
that
period
of
181
day
could
not
reasonably
be
separate
from
they
time
in
the
institution
.
this
be
the
language
we
be
deal
with
.
this
be
the
context
in
which
the
Bill
be
be
put
before
we
.
this
be
how
serious
it
be
.
10
.
the
enhance
medical
card
propose
in
the
General
Scheme
have
be
replace
by
health
service
without
charge
and
be
available
for
anyone
resident
for
180
day
...
this
residency
requirement
be
arbitrary
and
should
be
remove
.
we
be
all
ad
idem
in
the
Opposition
on
that
point
.
the
timeframe
of
zero
to
six
month
be
just
too
arbitrary
.
11
.
survivor
resident
outside
of
Ireland
be
entitle
to
a
payment
of
€3000
instead
of
health
service
without
charge
...
this
figure
be
far
too
low
and
be
not
reflective
of
the
value
of
the
service
available
to
that
receive
health
service
without
charge
.
12
.
survivor
have
call
specifically
for
trauma
-
inform
counselling
and
therapy
.
this
be
not
provide
for
in
the
Bill
.
13
.
there
be
no
requirement
in
the
Bill
that
that
charge
to
administer
the
Redress
scheme
must
be
qualify
for
the
position
and
be
subject
to
ongoing
training
in
international
human
rights
law
and
trauma
-
inform
response
to
gross
human
rights
violation
.
the
minister
say
this
legislation
be
ground
in
human
rights
law
.
that
be
open
to
interpretation
and
critique
.
the
idea
of
put
decide
officer
within
the
Department
itself
be
something
we
will
deal
with
on
committee
stage
because
it
require
further
interrogation
.
we
in
the
Labour
Party
be
not
convinced
it
be
the
right
way
to
go
.
17
.
additionally
,
the
Bill
state
that
a
survivor
will
be
entitle
to
no
compensation
where
they
have
"
receive
a
award
from
a
court
or
settlement
in
respect
of
a
action
arise
out
of
any
circumstance
relate
to
the
same
period
of
residence
in
the
institution
"
...
this
provision
do
not
take
into
account
the
possibility
of
a
court
awarding
a
survivor
a
low
amount
of
compensation
than
they
would
receive
under
the
Bill
.
moreover
,
court
proceedings
may
not
necessarily
be
direct
towards
the
State
,
yet
the
Bill
preclude
such
a
individual
from
late
claim
compensation
from
the
State
.
again
,
this
be
a
serious
flaw
in
the
Bill
and
we
will
seek
to
amend
it
.
I
anticipate
,
however
,
that
we
amendment
will
be
rule
out
of
order
because
of
the
rule
that
apply
in
regard
to
such
amendment
.
we
ask
the
minister
to
reconsider
that
very
provision
in
section
27
of
the
Bill
,
paragraph
3
.
I
contend
that
will
have
to
be
deal
with
.
payment
rate
under
head
11
should
be
amend
to
remedy
the
failure
to
offer
payment
to
all
survivor
and
to
compensate
adequately
that
who
receive
payment
in
line
with
,
inter
alia
,
the
current
personal
injury
guideline
and
other
comparable
scheme
.
this
include
ptsd
payment
.
under
the
guideline
moderate
ptsd
equate
to
compensation
of
between
€
10000
and
€
35000
whereas
serious
ptsd
equate
to
€
35000
to
€
80000
.
the
Bill
do
not
require
that
free
legal
aid
be
make
available
to
all
applicant
in
circumstance
where
legal
aid
be
likely
to
be
require
in
apply
for
compensation
,
review
or
appealing
a
determination
and
in
swear
a
affidavit
that
could
be
require
of
they
.
this
should
be
provide
for
.
that
be
the
position
of
the
Irish
Council
of
Civil
liberty
on
this
Bill
,
all
of
which
I
agree
with
.
it
be
a
perfect
crystallisation
of
the
issue
that
we
be
deal
with
here
.
in
regard
to
we
attempt
to
amend
the
Bill
to
reflect
the
thought
and
aspiration
of
the
many
people
who
have
be
in
contact
with
we
we
will
now
seek
to
put
forward
a
amendment
in
regard
to
seek
a
report
on
the
operation
of
the
scheme
.
in
put
forward
that
amendment
we
will
seek
to
highlight
the
flaw
in
this
Bill
on
the
basis
that
we
will
seek
the
report
ask
whether
and
to
what
extent
person
engage
in
the
management
,
administration
or
operation
of
relevant
institution
should
be
permit
or
require
to
contribute
to
the
cost
of
make
payment
under
this
act
because
that
highlight
the
flaw
in
regard
to
party
which
be
not
party
to
the
redress
scheme
,
and
again
GSK
loom
large
in
we
thinking
there
;
whether
the
180
day
's
residence
requirement
provide
for
in
section
13
(
1
)
and
section
13
(
4
)
should
be
amend
or
repeal
;
whether
the
scheme
should
be
extend
to
make
provision
for
recognise
person
who
be
board
out
as
child
,
as
relevant
person
;
whether
there
be
a
need
to
provide
for
additional
institution
in
schedule
1
of
the
Bill
,
because
we
feel
it
be
not
a
all
-
encompass
Bill
in
that
regard
;
and
whether
the
requirement
impose
on
applicant
by
section
27
(
3
)
should
be
remove
.
section
27(
3
)
say
:
"
a
applicant
who
receive
a
payment
under
subsection
1
(
a
)
or
the
personal
representative
of
a
person
in
respect
of
whom
a
payment
be
make
under
subsection
1
shall
not
institute
civil
proceedings
and
shall
discontinue
any
other
proceedings
institute
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
applicant
against
a
public
body
that
arise
out
of
the
same
or
substantially
the
same
circumstance
as
the
circumstance
to
which
the
application
concern
related
.
"
that
be
basically
say
that
if
you
get
money
under
this
scheme
you
have
no
recourse
to
any
other
;
that
in
order
to
sign
the
bottom
line
to
get
you
money
,
redress
and
compensation
you
be
disbarr
yourself
from
any
further
action
on
the
same
issue
.
that
be
essentially
what
,
as
I
understand
it
,
the
minister
be
say
and
have
prescribe
in
this
legislation
.
the
Irish
Council
of
Civil
liberty
,
as
I
have
already
say
,
be
speak
to
this
point
.
a
number
of
solicitor
have
be
in
touch
with
we
who
be
concerned
about
the
perception
that
this
Bill
create
,
that
people
will
not
have
access
to
the
legal
advice
to
which
every
citizen
be
entitle
on
any
matter
of
law
before
they
,
particularly
in
circumstance
such
as
this
where
people
will
need
advocate
.
as
deputy
we
will
act
as
advocate
for
people
.
however
,
I
be
not
a
lawyer
.
there
will
be
time
when
people
will
want
to
interface
and
may
seek
to
take
further
action
,
as
I
think
should
be
they
right
,
in
civil
proceedings
.
they
should
not
be
proscribe
from
do
that
.
I
will
speak
specifically
to
the
human
rights
element
of
this
in
regard
to
the
Irish
human
Right
and
Equality
Commission
,
IHREC
.
the
minister
speak
to
the
fact
that
he
take
on
board
,
if
I
be
interpret
he
correctly
,
the
paper
that
be
publish
by
the
IHREC
.
I
will
quote
again
from
the
IHREC
.
its
advisory
paper
state
:
"
the
Commission
of
investigation
report
be
limit
in
term
of
the
institution
"
that
it
cover
.
I
have
say
that
already
.
in
the
past
,
the
exclusion
of
certain
institution
in
Ireland
have
create
a
barrier
to
seek
recourse
to
any
meaningful
reparation
for
survivor
,
despite
have
be
subject
to
serious
harm
.
the
paper
continue
:
Recent
research
from
Queen
's
University
identify
the
difficulty
of
rely
on
previous
investigation
to
inform
the
scope
of
reparation
's
scheme
and
which
result
in
exclude
certain
institution
:
''
refuse
redress
for
this
victim
or
base
redress
on
the
same
assumption
and
availability
of
evidence
already
collect
through
investigation
,
create
a
hierarchy
of
victim
,
silence
that
at
other
institution
and
compromise
the
efficacy
…
of
the
redress
scheme
overall
.
''
that
be
a
glaring
point
that
have
not
be
address
in
this
Bill
.
we
cannot
have
that
hierarchy
.
for
too
long
on
this
island
there
have
be
a
hierarchy
of
victim
.
we
can
have
no
more
of
that
,
I
respectfully
contend
.
Mr.
Spicer
,
a
solicitor
who
correspond
with
we
,
state
that
the
minister
quite
worryingly
seem
to
indicate
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
have
the
staff
in
he
own
Department
handle
the
many
thousand
of
inquiry
.
this
be
not
only
impractical
in
term
of
the
logistical
capability
of
have
a
handful
of
staff
handle
ten
of
thousand
of
call
.
it
lack
basic
independence
and
it
would
be
entirely
inappropriate
for
the
minister
's
own
staff
to
be
advise
service
user
on
they
rights
,
comment
on
whether
they
should
apply
to
the
scheme
,
help
we
community
to
weigh
up
the
pro
and
con
of
the
scheme
or
anything
else
that
the
community
need
help
with
in
term
of
put
they
application
together
.
give
the
experience
of
survivor
in
regard
to
the
commission
's
report
,
that
people
,
who
we
represent
,
be
now
expect
to
interface
with
the
minister
's
Department
and
to
have
confidence
in
that
process
.
they
do
not
have
confidence
.
they
want
to
be
able
to
deal
with
somebody
who
be
verifiably
independent
.
Mr.
Spicer
continue
to
state
that
the
community
cannot
be
lead
with
they
hand
hold
by
the
State
to
accept
this
redress
without
independent
legal
advice
form
part
of
the
decision
-
making
process
should
the
applicant
so
wish
.
this
scheme
have
to
operate
with
complete
transparency
and
fairness
.
part
of
that
process
be
the
right
to
consult
with
a
choose
and
trust
legal
representative
not
only
on
the
scheme
itself
but
also
in
consideration
of
the
individual
's
own
live
experience
and
balancing
that
with
the
provision
in
the
scheme
.
applicant
therefore
must
feel
that
they
can
voice
they
concern
and
be
give
feedback
in
a
confidential
setting
with
they
trust
legal
representative
.
I
understand
the
minister
's
genuine
attempt
to
formulate
a
scheme
here
but
the
legislation
before
we
as
it
be
constitute
do
not
deal
adequately
with
a
whole
raft
of
issue
that
remain
outstanding
.
I
hope
the
minister
will
be
of
a
mind
to
introduce
amendment
to
he
own
legislation
on
committee
stage
which
would
deal
particularly
with
section
27
and
section
3
in
regard
to
the
right
to
further
civil
proceedings
if
a
applicant
so
wish
,
where
they
be
deem
to
have
already
receive
compensation
or
redress
.
I
also
believe
strongly
that
if
the
issue
of
the
zero
to
six
month
be
not
deal
with
then
the
legislation
disregard
so
many
people
.
previously
I
ask
of
the
minister
,
on
the
record
of
the
House
,
what
analysis
have
the
minister
and
he
Department
official
do
on
the
number
of
people
in
the
zero
and
six
month
group
who
could
potentially
form
part
of
this
scheme
and
whether
that
be
quantifiable
.
if
it
be
,
what
would
the
additional
cost
of
that
have
be
to
the
scheme
?
there
have
be
a
weight
of
evidence
give
to
we
on
this
already
,
which
the
minister
will
be
well
aware
of
.
it
be
too
arbitrary
to
exclude
from
the
scheme
people
who
be
resident
for
less
than
six
month
.
again
,
I
be
respectfully
ask
the
minister
to
please
reconsider
that
.
it
seem
that
the
reason
for
it
be
that
perhaps
some
analysis
have
be
do
on
the
cost
of
this
and
it
be
such
that
the
government
decide
it
would
be
too
costly
to
add
that
onto
the
€
800
million
budget
line
that
have
already
be
assign
to
this
.
therefore
,
it
have
take
a
arbitrary
decision
.
we
will
revisit
many
of
this
issue
on
committee
stage
.
in
accordance
with
standing
order
80
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
in
two
week
.
as
far
back
as
July
2016
we
former
colleague
,
Willie
Penrose
,
publish
a
Bill
to
amend
the
constitution
to
ensure
public
ownership
of
we
public
utility
.
this
would
have
cover
not
just
we
public
water
supply
and
wastewater
treatment
infrastructure
but
also
we
gas
and
electricity
transmission
network
.
seven
year
on
,
we
be
no
close
to
see
such
a
referendum
be
propose
.
it
have
always
be
we
position
that
we
water
infrastructure
should
remain
in
public
ownership
.
it
be
most
important
to
note
that
there
be
never
any
proposal
to
privatise
it
despite
a
lot
of
rhetoric
on
the
issue
.
water
be
a
public
good
that
ought
to
be
accessible
and
State
-
run
in
perpetuity
to
ensure
the
State
be
resilient
in
the
event
of
any
crisis
in
supply
or
distribution
.
with
respect
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
I
have
hear
nothing
about
a
referendum
.
the
wording
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
be
not
specific
as
to
when
the
referendum
would
take
place
.
we
need
a
specific
date
and
time
or
some
timeline
to
ensure
the
referendum
take
place
.
it
be
vitally
important
to
maintain
public
confidence
by
ensure
it
be
retain
in
State
ownership
.
I
will
address
the
quality
of
supply
in
the
Cork
region
.
I
will
name
place
such
as
Inchigeelagh
,
Ballycotton
,
Castletownshend
,
Whitegate
,
Aghada
,
Mitchelstown
,
Rathcormack
,
Kinsale
and
Clonakilty
from
where
raw
sewage
be
go
into
the
sea
.
there
be
continuous
boil
water
notice
in
place
such
as
Aghada
and
Whitegate
,
as
there
be
in
the
little
enclave
of
Killavullen
.
good
and
decent
people
live
in
Killavullen
who
,
up
to
a
few
year
ago
,
never
have
a
boil
water
notice
.
as
the
local
deputy
represent
that
area
,
I
still
cannot
get
a
answer
as
to
why
there
be
boil
water
notice
in
Killavullen
.
I
still
cannot
get
a
definitive
answer
from
Irish
Water
with
regard
to
Whitegate
or
Aghada
.
Cork
county
councillor
will
tell
the
Minister
of
State
the
same
.
it
be
report
by
Sean
O'Riordan
in
yesterday
's
Irish
Examiner
that
they
be
extremely
frustrate
by
the
lack
of
engagement
by
Irish
Water
on
matter
such
as
boil
water
notice
.
the
quality
of
communication
from
Irish
Water
have
diminish
substantially
in
the
past
12
month
.
it
be
very
hard
to
get
up
-
to
-
the
-
minute
information
.
if
we
be
try
to
serve
we
constituent
to
the
good
of
we
ability
,
they
deserve
answer
as
to
why
there
be
boil
water
notice
in
Killavullen
and
in
place
such
as
Whitegate
and
Aghada
.
we
have
not
be
able
to
define
or
pin
down
the
nature
of
the
problem
.
update
need
to
be
provide
and
proper
answer
give
to
public
representative
in
this
House
and
local
authority
.
the
quality
of
the
engagement
be
exceptionally
poor
.
dire
I
say
it
,
every
time
I
put
down
a
parliamentary
question
to
seek
information
from
the
Minister
's
Department
,
I
be
tell
it
be
not
a
matter
for
the
Department
.
in
the
most
recent
reply
,
date
yesterday
,
I
be
tell
that
it
be
not
a
matter
for
the
Department
,
that
all
operational
matter
be
a
matter
for
Irish
Water
,
and
that
the
Department
"
maintain
a
ongoing
engagement
with
Irish
Water
regard
strategic
,
financial
and
general
operational
matter
"
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
I
suggest
the
minister
's
Department
be
answerable
to
this
House
and
to
individual
deputy
when
we
put
down
parliamentary
question
as
to
why
there
be
boil
water
notice
or
when
we
seek
information
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
reverse
engine
on
the
policy
of
not
inform
we
,
as
member
,
because
we
need
to
be
able
to
inform
we
constituent
.
however
,
the
fundamental
question
be
why
Killavullen
,
as
one
example
,
have
boil
water
notice
.
what
be
the
reason
for
that
boil
water
notice
and
why
be
they
not
be
fix
?
why
be
the
problem
not
be
resolve
?
why
have
the
issue
in
Whitegate
and
Aghada
not
be
resolve
?
a
Cheann
Comhairle
,
thank
you
very
much
for
that
response
.
if
the
Department
maintain
a
relationship
on
operational
matter
,
I
respectfully
suggest
there
be
a
level
of
accountability
on
the
part
of
the
minister
to
this
House
with
regard
to
operational
matter
.
forty

you

I

I

do
not

to

that
.

I

I
acknowledge
the
work
of
Mallow
Development

excellent

Fair
that
take

on

the
Irish
American

and
Cork
County
Council
,
work
through
the
Mallow

to
bring
science
to

people
.
I
pay
tribute
to
everybody
who
be
involved
.
although
the
event
take
place
every
year
on
a
Sunday
,
if
the
minister
be
of
a
mind
and
be
still
in
the
Department
this
time
next
year
we
would
be
delighted
to
welcome
he
to
Mallow
.
he
could
see
for
himself
the
interplay
between
student
,
member
of
the
public
and
research
entity
like
Teagasc
and
all
the
citizen
science
engagement
that
take
place
.
it
be
a
perfect
model
and
I
acknowledge
the
successful
role
play
by
Mallow
Development
Partnership
in
bring
it
about
.
it
be
bring
science
to
the
people
and
a
excellent
example
of
science
in
action
.
a
entity
close
to
my
own
heart
be
the
Irish
Centre
for
Maternal
and
Child
Health
Research
,
INFANT
,
in
Cork
.
it
be
such
a
important
entity
in
term
of
perinatal
healthcare
,
make
pregnancy
safe
for
woman
,
ensure
the
health
and
future
well
-
being
of
child
and
improve
the
survival
and
long
-
term
health
outcome
for
newborn
baby
.
the
minister
must
forgive
I
for
be
parochial
again
,
but
if
he
ever
happen
to
find
himself
visit
University
College
Cork
and
if
he
visit
infant
,
he
will
see
for
himself
the
excellent
work
that
be
carry
.
it
be
really
impactful
research
meet
societal
challenge
,
which
be
so
important
to
all
of
we
.
it
be
incongruous
that
at
a
time
we
be
set
up
the
maritime
area
regulatory
authority
,
MARA
,
to
deal
with
consent
and
licence
around
offshore
wind
,
we
have
a
world
-
class
entity
call
MaREI
do
world
-
class
research
on
offshore
wind
.
the
science
have
move
ahead
of
implementation
on
the
ground
,
on
the
seabed
or
float
on
the
water
.
what
I
mean
be
that
while
we
be
do
excellent
research
here
,
we
need
MARA
to
issue
that
consent
when
it
be
create
in
order
that
the
excellent
research
on
wind
turbine
and
offshore
wind
can
lead
to
a
throughput
of
project
to
deal
with
we
future
energy
need
.
we
can
be
concentrate
on
the
excellence
of
science
in
Ireland
but
if
it
do
not
have
the
impact
on
the
island
of
Ireland
or
off
we
shore
and
if
there
be
not
expeditious
connectivity
with
industry
,
the
gap
will
need
to
be
plug
.
if
the
minister
visit
Cork
,
he
should
talk
to
the
people
in
MaREI
and
he
will
see
the
potential
.
we
in
Labour
support
the
call
of
retain
firefighter
for
a
more
sustainable
and
improve
working
model
include
decent
pay
,
fix
income
and
structure
,
limited
working
hour
that
be
consistent
with
the
European
working
time
directive
.
the
current
recruitment
and
retention
crisis
be
a
result
of
poor
term
and
condition
of
employment
and
the
constant
failure
to
resource
and
fund
adequately
the
retain
fire
service
.

that
many
be

to
work

or
avail
of

to

they

.
furthermore
,
the
lack
of
a
fix

make
it
difficult
for
retain
firefighter
to
get
a
mortgage
.
I
have
first
-
hand
experience
of
that
with
constituent
of
mine
.
retain
firefighter
be
effectively
lock
out
of
social
participation
.
when
they
be
call
to
duty
,
they
must
be
within
five
minute
of
the
fire
station
.
this
place
severe
restriction
on
they
ability
to
participate
in
everyday
activity
such
as
bring
they
child
to
school
,
play
a
football
match
,
visit
relative
,
attend
social
occasion
or
even
go
for
a
short
walk
.
they
be
essentially
under
a
form
of
house
arrest
while
on
call
.
it
be
unfathomable
that
we
would
expect
this
worker
to
put
up
with
such
condition
.
poor
pay
and
condition
have
result
in
this
crisis
of
retention
and
recruitment
.
some
source
indicate
that
as
many
as
60
%
of
worker
,
and
we
hear
this
already
tonight
,
be
consider
leave
the
service
in
the
very
near
future
.
staff
shortage
among
the
fire
service
pose
a
serious
threat
to
delivery
and
consequently
to
everyone
's
safety
.
if
a
crew
respond
to
a
emergency
do
not
have
sufficient
number
to
enter
a
fire
,
we
could
be
talk
about
a
potential
loss
of
life
.
the
last
collective
agreement
make
with
retain
firefighter
be
23
year
ago
and
the
model
have
not
keep
pace
with
the
change
to
the
socioeconomic
and
working
landscape
of
the
country
.
retain
firefighter
be
suffer
economically
,
socially
and
mentally
.
it
be
time
the
government
introduce
a
more
sustainable
model
that
will
address
the
recruitment
and
retention
crisis
and
show
this
vital
worker
that
it
recognise
they
value
and
contribution
to
we
safety
as
citizen
by
provide
they
with
good
pay
and
working
condition
.
they
deserve
nothing
less
.
they
be
we
friend
,
neighbour
and
family
member
.
we
know
they
;
they
live
within
we
community
.
they
be
always
around
and
always
on
call
.
we
must
value
they
.
I
echo
the
point
of
previous
deputy
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
we
have
not
be
issue
with
a
copy
of
the
Minister
's
speech
.
it
be
important
in
debate
like
this
for
we
to
have
a
copy
in
order
that
we
can
parse
the
word
of
the
minister
as
he
be
speak
so
we
can
respond
on
the
hoof
,
as
it
be
.
I
note
that
he
say
the
review
will
be
publish
shortly
.
he
talk
about
change
in
structure
,
culture
and
the
delivery
model
.
he
speak
about
a
sequence
of
step
for
a
new
model
of
delivery
.
to
be
fair
to
he
,
I
have
no
doubt
about
the
minister
's
bona
fide
in
seek
to
arrive
at
a
solution
whereby
everybody
can
be
deal
with
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
.
I
suggest
to
the
minister
that
this
be
not
just
about
statistic
regard
fire
.
we
know
it
be
important
to
have
a
assessment
of
the
other
service
that
be
deliver
by
retain
firefighter
in
term
of
call
-
out
.
there
need
to
be
a
quantitative
and
qualitative
analysis
of
the
type
of
call
-
out
that
take
place
in
community
such
as
that
I
serve
in
which
firefighter
be
call
out
for
any
manner
and
number
of
reason
.
that
must
also
be
factor
in
when
the
minister
talk
about
a
new
model
of
delivery
.
the
bottom
line
for
all
of
we
be
that
in
support
the
Sinn
Féin
motion
,
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
firefighter
within
we
community
.
we
have
all
do
that
collectively
tonight
but
we
must
now
move
beyond
the
phase
of
empathy
and
sympathy
for
they
position
into
a
phase
where
we
have
some
regard
to
concrete
timeline
for
delivery
.
if
I
understand
the
minister
correctly
,
he
be
say
he
be
move
or
seek
to
move
in
that
direction
and
that
he
will
work
with
the
interested
party
to
deliver
a
new
model
.
inherent
within
that
,
however
,
must
be
a
recognition
of
the
pay
and
condition
of
worker
.
there
need
to
be
a
significant
improvement
on
that
.
if
I
be
to
ask
the
minister
one
thing
tonight
,
it
would
be
to
give
we
some
concrete
timeline
in
respect
of
when
he
expect
this
process
to
be
complete
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
everything
he
speak
about
in
he
appreciation
of
the
work
retain
firefighter
do
will
be
recognise
and
in
that
appreciation
and
recognition
of
they
role
,
the
fruit
of
they
labour
will
be
recognise
and
we
will
see
real
and
concrete
delivery
of
good
pay
and
condition
as
the
primary
aim
of
all
of
this
.
will
he
please
give
we
the
timeline
as
to
when
that
will
be
deliver
?
the
minister
speak
of
the
implication
for
both
side
.
I
be
not
quite
sure
exactly
what
he
mean
when
he
say
that
.
I
suppose
he
be
talk
about
the
worker
and
the
employer
.
there
be
always
a
way
of
find
solution
,
however
.
ultimately
,
we
want
to
ensure
that
we
have
a
cohort
of
professional
people
and
that
it
be
a
attractive
profession
to
enter
.
the
minister
say
that
be
what
he
want
to
achieve
.
let
we
take
he
at
he
word
.
he
might
give
we
timeline
,
however
.
I
also
note
the
minister
make
reference
to
gender
equality
in
respect
of
recruitment
and
retention
.
we
absolutely
support
he
in
that
regard
.
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
I
be
hopeful
that
we
would
have
a
set
of
timeline
.
I
would
not
accuse
the
minister
of
this
,
to
be
fair
,
but
very
often
we
have
aspirational
and
empathetic
statement
by
minister
come
before
we
.
what
the
people
in
the
Gallery
and
that
watch
outside
really
want
be
a
clear
indication
of
the
timeline
for
delivery
.
that
be
the
bottom
line
.
when
will
this
new
model
be
roll
out
?
what
be
the
timeline
and
the
stage
-
gate
process
that
have
to
be
go
through
to
ensure
we
get
over
all
the
hurdle
and
challenge
?
we
must
ensure
that
in
the
community
that
we
all
serve
,
there
be
a
fit
-
for
-
purpose
retain
fire
service
in
which
morale
be
high
and
the
staff
be
happy
to
do
they
job
.
we
must
continue
to
recognise
the
work
they
be
do
and
ensure
the
term
and
condition
of
employment
be
fit
for
purpose
and
be
not
anachronistic
.
we
should
not
take
they
for
grant
.
if
I
dare
say
it
,
I
think
they
may
be
take
for
grant
within
we
community
.
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
seriously
.
the
process
the
minister
talk
about
seem
to
be
real
,
if
it
be
chair
by
Mr.
Begg
.
however
,
we
will
have
to
see
implementation
of
it
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
it
have
come
to
my
attention
in
recent
day
that
it
be
the
intention
of
the
Court
Service
to
move
sitting
of
District
Court
no.
20
in
Mallow
,
County
Cork
,
and
centralise
that
service
in
Cork
city
.
I
wish
to
express
my
grave
concern
at
such
a
move
,
give
that
the
District
Court
in
Mallow
serve
a
large
geographical
area
that
extend
as
far
as
the
County
Kerry
border
and
north
to
County
Limerick
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
Court
Service
's
intention
be
to
move
District
Court
sitting
to
Cork
city
,
it
will
have
a
massive
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
region
I
represent
.
I
say
that
because
Mallow
host
sitting
in
respect
of
criminal
and
civil
proceedings
on
the
first
,
second
,
third
and
fourth
Tuesday
of
each
month
.
it
also
host
juvenile
and
family
case
on
the
first
Wednesday
of
each
month
and
childcare
and
HSE
proceedings
on
the
second
Wednesday
of
each
month
.
I
be
give
to
understand
the
sitting
will
move
to
Washington
Street
in
Cork
city
.
I
be
also
give
to
understand
that
the
Court
Service
administration
will
be
retain
in
Mallow
.
I
be
deeply
worried
that
it
be
now
court
service
policy
to
centralise
more
and
more
District
Court
sitting
.
this
be
happen
without
any
proper
scrutiny
of
that
policy
.
we
be
very
limited
in
what
we
can
do
to
scrutinise
that
.
the
only
opportunity
deputy
have
to
do
so
be
to
raise
it
as
a
topical
issue
matter
because
we
be
tell
the
Court
service
be
independent
,
as
it
should
be
.
we
acknowledge
that
and
there
be
no
question
about
it
.
there
be
issue
,
however
,
relate
to
the
administration
of
justice
.
I
be
particularly
concerned
about
the
family
court
and
the
seek
of
specific
order
.
for
instance
,
if
a
woman
,
and
it
be
largely
woman
,
come
before
the
court
to
seek
protection
regard
a
domestic
or
gender
-
base
violence
issue
,
that
service
will
not
be
available
at
the
most
local
level
within
the
District
Court
.
that
person
will
now
be
force
to
go
to
Cork
city
and
may
not
be
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
I
be
genuinely
worried
-
this
happen
in
Youghal
and
be
now
happen
in
Mallow
-
that
there
be
no
scrutiny
of
what
the
Court
Service
be
do
.
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
use
he
good
office
to
intervene
with
the
minister
for
Justice
,
deputy
McEntee
,
if
at
all
possible
.
the
minister
have
put
particular
emphasis
on
combate
gender
-
base
violence
and
have
acknowledge
the
"
stark
"
,
to
use
she
word
,
domestic
violence
figure
that
exist
in
this
country
.
if
we
remove
the
ability
of
people
to
get
access
to
the
court
at
the
most
local
level
through
District
Court
sitting
and
force
they
to
travel
further
to
seek
justice
and
to
interface
with
the
administration
of
justice
,
that
be
a
poor
show
on
the
part
of
the
Court
Service
.
I
ask
the
government
at
least
to
intervene
to
ensure
the
District
Court
sitting
at
Mallow
will
continue
to
be
host
there
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
have
receive
some
comfort
from
he
response
in
regard
to
the
remedial
work
that
be
to
be
carry
out
.
however
,
it
be
my
firm
contention
,
and
perhaps
I
should
have
make
this
clear
,
that
it
be
about
the
loss
of
court
sitting
in
Mallow
.
I
contend
it
would
have
be
very
easy
to
provide
alternative
accommodation
within
the
town
of
Mallow
itself
and
not
to
have
to
send
people
further
to
Fermoy
and
Cork
in
respect
of
circuit
Court
sitting
.
for
instance
,
the
Court
Service
could
have
engage
with
the
local
GAA
club
,
which
have
ample
facility
to
be
able
to
make
provision
for
court
sitting
.
it
be
the
loss
of
a
service
to
a
town
.
although
I
acknowledge
it
be
on
a
temporary
basis
,
the
fear
be
that
once
service
get
consolidate
to
another
court
,
they
do
not
return
,
and
we
have
Youghal
as
a
example
.
the
Minister
of
State
have
give
we
some
assurance
but
,
whether
the
Court
Service
listen
to
this
debate
or
not
,
it
be
vital
there
be
some
sort
of
confirmation
directly
from
the
Court
Service
that
it
be
its
intention
,
absolutely
and
utterly
,
to
ensure
we
service
will
be
return
to
Mallow
post
the
completion
of
remedial
work
.
I
still
need
to
interpret
the
word
of
the
Minister
of
State
in
respect
of
the
domestic
violence
provision
.
I
reiterate
that
it
be
about
ensure
that
where
there
be
a
government
policy
specifically
spearhead
by
the
minister
,
deputy
McEntee
,
in
regard
to
combate
gender
-
base
violence
,
and
with
the
minister
herself
acknowledge
the
stark
figure
in
regard
to
domestic
violence
,
we
do

I
welcome
the
Bill
.
we
will
support
it
and
seek
to
amend
it
in
place
if
that
be
allowable
.
I
will
start
with
the
issue
raise
by
the
minister
regard
incentive
provide
for
uilleann
pipe
maker
and
the
exemption
that
be
propose
relate
to
income
tax
.
the
uilleann
pipe
,
as
I
understand
it
,
carry
UN
heritage
status
,
which
we
all
support
.
they
be
deem
to
have
UNESCO
intangible
heritage
status
similar
to
that
of
the
hurley
or
,
the
hurl
,
depend
on
which
part
of
the
country
one
be
from
.
in
my
part
of
the
world
,
in
Cork
,
they
be
call
hurley
.
we
know
there
be
a
crisis
with
regard
to
ash
and
a
considerable
challenge
in
provide
for
hurl
,
which
have
UNESCO
intangible
heritage
status
.
if
the
minister
could
see
fit
to
look
at
the
game
of
hurl
and
the
value
of
the
hurl
,
or
hurley
,
she
would
receive
the
broad
acclamation
of
this
House
in
devise
a
similar
scheme
for
hurley
maker
.
for
some
time
now
,
we
have
be
advocate
for
increase
in
the
threshold
for
the
fuel
allowance
.
all
of
we
on
the
Opposition
bench
be
carry
to
the
minister
story
of
we
constituent
whereby
they
have
become
marginally
over
the
threshold
,
in
some
instance
by
a
matter
of
cent
,
and
be
deem
ineligible
.
this
happen
in
the
over
-
70
category
in
particular
where
there
would
have
be
a
small
occupational
pension
and
,
for
the
most
part
,
people
who
be
live
in
old
housing
stock
with
d
and
E
ber
rating
or
exemption
in
some
case
.
I
welcome
the
move
by
the
minister
to
increase
the
threshold
on
the
fuel
allowance
because
it
will
bring
many
people
into
the
net
.
in
my
constituency
office
,
I
field
many
query
about
the
fuel
allowance
and
the
increase
in
the
threshold
.
we
be
tee
up
a
increase
in
the
number
of
people
who
anticipate
that
they
will
apply
.
we
be
face
into
Christmas
.
if
there
be
any
possibility
that
it
could
be
fast
-
track
to
before
Christmas
,
there
would
be
many
more
applicant
in
the
system
.
if
there
be
any
way
to
do
that
,
I
respectfully
ask
the
minister
to
consider
it
,
give
that
we
be
in
the
midst
of
a
fuel
crisis
.
I
realise
it
may
not
be
possible
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
minister
have
make
a
substantial
change
to
fuel
allowance
policy
to
ensure
that
more
people
be
bring
into
the
net
.
that
have
to
be
acknowledge
.
I
could
use
the
cliché
and
say
that
I
be
glad
the
minister
listen
to
the
Labour
Party
on
this
.
the
Zeitgeist
be
capture
and
,
know
the
minister
to
be
a
sound
constituency
worker
in
she
own
constituency
,
I
be
sure
she
be
listen
to
many
people
who
be
put
over
the
threshold
and
take
on
board
the
view
of
people
in
she
constituency
and
make
change
accordingly
.
I
would
like
to
think
we
influence
the
minister
in
some
respect
with
regard
to
this
policy
change
.
I
would
like
to
raise
a
broad
policy
issue
.
the
debate
on
this
Bill
be
the
appropriate
time
and
place
to
raise
it
.
my
colleague
and
I
be
increasingly
find
issue
when
people
be
make
application
for
scheme
where
medical
evidence
be
necessary
,
there
be
a
pro
forma
protocol
to
go
through
,
with
a
doctor
's
letter
or
medical
evidence
depend
on
whether
it
be
illness
benefit
,
disability
allowance
,
invalidity
pension
or
partial
capacity
payment
,
or
whatever
else
the
payment
be
which
require
medical
evidence
.
the
issue
I
be
pick
up
when
assist
people
in
we
office
to
make
application
involve
a
lag
in
get
medical
evidence
because
of
the
challenge
that
people
face
in
get
general
practitioner
,
gps
.
person
will
want
something
sign
by
the
gp
and
will
phone
the
gp
's
practice
,
then
will
speak
to
the
gatekeeper
,
which
I
do
not
say
in
a
pejorative
way
,
the
secretary
or
administrator
.
it
can
often
take
a
long
time
for
that
form
to
be
sign
.
that
create
a
follow
-
on
lag
time
before
people
can
benefit
from
a
payment
that
they
be
eligible
for
anyway
.
can
we
look
at
the
need
for
people
to
go
into
pharmacy
and
get
print
-
out
of
they
prescription
,
where
they
have
to
go
to
the
gp
surgery
to
get
access
to
a
sign
form
from
a
gp
?
be
there
a
way
to
streamline
the
process
by
make
it
more
efficient
,
to
facilitate
the
applicant
,
include
with
the
option
for
a
paper
-
base
system
in
accordance
with
citizen
's
rights
and
wish
,
and
also
to
make
it
more
streamlined
for
the
gp
,
pharmacist
,
and
person
who
be
deal
with
the
case
in
the
Department
of
social
Protection
?
I
make
that
observation
base
on
the
dramatic
increase
in
the
number
of
application
that
we
be
field
in
constituency
office
where
there
be
illness
-
related
payment
to
be
make
and
particularly
in
light
of
Covid
,
since
we
be
see
a
great
preponderance
of
respiratory
-
related
illness
.
one
can
call
it
long
Covid
.
I
perceive
a
significant
increase
in
the
number
of
people
look
to
claim
disability
allowance
,
invalidity
pension
,
illness
benefit
and
so
on
.
I
make
that
point
in
the
hope
that
the
minister
might
respond
to
say
that
some
internal
work
be
go
on
to
try
to
make
it
as
streamlined
as
possible
to
ensure
that
the
applicant
can
have
a
decision
with
a
short
lead
-
in
time
,
if
possible
.
while
I
be
on
the
issue
of
medical
assessment
,
some
application
have
to
go
to
a
department
-
appoint
medical
assessor
.
be
there
scope
to
appoint
more
medical
assessor
in
the
Department
?
what
be
the
minister
's
view
on
whether
there
be
a
sufficient
number
of
medical
assessor
to
decide
on
a
initial
application
or
on
appeal
?
I
perceive
that
it
be
take
long
now
than
it
use
to
for
caseload
to
work
through
the
system
.
I
have
great
sympathy
for
employee
in
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
where
it
seem
that
caseload
be
increase
.
I
be
not
sure
whether
that
be
because
of
a
lack
of
additional
staff
be
assign
to
appeal
.
the
minister
's
perspective
would
be
helpful
.
I
refer
to
people
who
be
carer
and
,
want
to
use
the
right
language
,
to
people
who
be
neurodivergent
or
who
have
a
intellectual
disability
.
when
they
be
over
16
,
they
be
not
eligible
for
a
domiciliary
care
allowance
but
a
carer
's
benefit
or
allowance
may
have
be
apply
.
deputy
Kerrane
refer
to
this
too
.
I
share
she
view
that
there
be
circumstance
where
if
somebody
be
care
for
a
adult
and
have
be
eligible
for
that
carer
's
allowance
or
benefit
heretofore
,
a
spouse
may
work
overtime
,
which
then
have
a
massive
consequence
for
the
carer
.
carer
lose
carer
's
benefit
because
they
household
income
have
go
over
a
certain
threshold
and
they
lose
medical
card
too
.
there
would
be
great
sympathy
and
support
if
the
minister
be
to
look
at
what
I
perceive
to
be
a
relatively
small
number
of
case
where
people
be
care
for
people
and
have
lose
benefit
.
they
may
have
forgo
career
opportunity
themselves
,
have
decide
that
they
want
to
care
for
the
people
who
they
be
care
for
.
they
want
to
ensure
that
people
be
care
for
and
,
heretofore
,
the
State
recognise
that
in
certain
circumstance
.
however
,
the
spouse
will
rightly
have
seek
and
benefit
from
overtime
,
and
so
the
carer
be
kick
out
of
the
system
and
lose
everything
.
the
minister
will
be
familiar
with
such
case
.
if
that
could
be
look
at
again
,
it
would
be
greatly
appreciate
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
clarify
the
national
minimum
wage
.
with
the
cost
-
of
-
living
crisis
,
we
have
a
view
that
if
the
minimum
wage
could
be
raise
to
€
12
,
it
would
at
least
go
some
way
towards
meet
the
cost
-
of
-
living
issue
that
worker
have
encounter
.
I
refer
also
to
prsi
threshold
and
one
school
of
thought
.
I
defer
to
my
colleague
,
deputy
Ged
Nash
,
who
I
ask
about
this
early
.
he
say
that
as
PRSI
threshold
apply
now
,
if
there
be
a
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
,
the
prsi
contribution
that
be
due
would
mean
that
,
in
real
term
,
a
person
would
not
get
the
full
benefit
of
that
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
.
I
refer
quickly
to
the
minister
's
contribution
,
where
she
state
:
weekly
earnings
in
excess
of
€410
attract
employer
prsi
at
a
high
rate
of
11.05
%
.
the
earnings
threshold
increase
from
€
410
to
€
441
in
section
4
be
design
to
take
account
of
the
forthcoming
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
from
€
10.50
to
€
11.30
per
hour
.
I
would
like
some
clarification
on
that
in
case
there
be
a
real
-
term
loss
of
income
to
a
worker
as
a
result
of
a
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
.
I
would
appreciate
it
if
that
could
be
address
.
the
other
issue
be
people
who
be
on
invalidity
payment
not
be
eligible
for
the
bonus
payment
.
there
be
so
many
category
of
people
in
receipt
of
social
welfare
payment
who
will
receive
the
bonus
or
who
have
heretofore
and
I
do
not
understand
why
that
on
the
invalidity
pension
do
not
seem
to
have
be
the
beneficiary
of
the
bonus
payment
,
though
maybe
I
be
misread
it
.
I
would
like
some
clarification
on
that
.
I
may
,
as
I
say
,
have
it
wrong
and
I
put
a
health
warning
on
what
I
be
say
in
that
regard
as
well
.
broadly
speak
,
we
welcome
the
Bill
.
we
will
examine
it
on
committee
stage
.
we
recognise
that
of
we
in
Opposition
be
hamper
in
the
type
of
amendment
we
can
put
forward
but
them
the
rule
,
as
they
say
.
we
will
try
to
push
the
envelope
as
good
we
can
in
Opposition
to
try
to
promulgate
on
behalf
of
the
people
we
represent
.
if
some
of
the
process
I
have
reference
for
application
for
illness
-
related
payment
could
be
look
at
and
streamline
,
that
would
be
welcome
.
there
be
also
the
gap
that
still
exist
with
access
to
community
welfare
officer
in
certain
part
of
the
country
.
there
be
people
who
could
be
avail
of
exceptional
need
payment
and
urgent
need
payment
but
they
be
not
because
they
do
not
have
access
to
that
face
-
to
-
face
contact
with
cwo
on
the
ground
.
I
be
lucky
that
in
my
area
we
have
exceptional
cwo
but
there
be
part
of
the
country
where
there
be
still
gap
.
there
be
still
people
who
-
and
I
do
not
mean
this
in
any
condescending
or
patronising
way
-
will
not
interface
with
technology
or
if
they
have
to
go
on
the
phone
find
it
challenging
because
they
want
to
sit
down
and
give
context
to
the
case
they
be
make
.
we
should
not
lose
that
in
any
way
,
if
that
can
be
help
.
I
thank
both
deputy
.
I
could
hear
the
passion
in
both
they
voice
as
they
speak
about
this
issue
,
and
the
genuine
concern
they
both
have
.
the
HSE
winter
plan
for
2022
-
23
will
support
community
service
this
winter
to
respond
to
anticipate
high
level
.
Specific
initiative
for
SUH
include
three
healthcare
assistant
to
support
community
service
on
the
chronic
disease
hub
,
three
administrative
staff
to
support
referral
pathway
between
SUH
and
the
community
,
one
clinical
nurse
manager
to
act
as
gp
liaison
,
three
emergency
medicine
consultant
and
one
registrar
to
assist
with
pre-admission
patient
flow
.
in
keep
with
the
principle
of
Sláintecare
,
the
government
will
continue
to
support
the
strategic
development
of
SUH
.
I
be
glad
that
the
minister
meet
with
the
consultant
last
night
.
when
34
consultant
put
pen
to
paper
and
write
to
the
minister
about
they
genuine
concern
,
I
be
glad
he
act
so
quickly
and
that
he
meet
they
.
as
I
outline
early
,
there
be
several
capital
development
in
train
at
the
hospital
,
but
I
know
that
the
two
deputy
be
really
concerned
about
the
here
and
now
and
the
challenge
of
the
winter
we
be
face
into
.
I
be
strike
by
the
fact
that
deputy
MacSharry
say
that
the
high
number
of
over
-
65
be
in
there
.
I
also
take
on
board
the
point
he
make
about
the
ct
scanner
,
the
MRI
replacement
and
the
single
point
of
failure
when
there
be
only
one
machine
and
it
do
not
work
.
I
will
pass
on
the
Deputy
comment
to
the
minister
.
the
minister
be
in
the
house
early
when
the
deputy
raise
this
matter
.
I
will
certainly
raise
all
of
the
concern
express
with
he
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
for
they
time
.
I

I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
to
the
House
.
I
wish
she
well
with
the
new
forestry
programme
that
have
be
devise
.
we
appreciate
that
it
be
a
draft
programme
.
one
certainly
perceive
there
have
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
energy
put
into
forestry
,
certainly
in
recent
month
.
the
premium
for
the
propose
forestry
programme
,
across
the
forestry
type
the
Minister
of
State
have
outline
,
indicate
a
significant
increase
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
for
that
who
will
plant
and
grow
tree
.
that
be
to
be
welcome
.
I
take
possession
of
a
interesting
report
by
Auxilia
Group
entitle
the
Economics
of
Afforestation
and
Management
in
Ireland
.
it
be
commission
and
be
publish
in
2022
.
I
be
sure
the
Minister
of
State
will
have
have
sight
of
it
.
the
key
person
who
drive
it
be
Professor
Cathal
O'Donoghue
,
whose
opinion
on
forestry
policy
matter
.
we
take
at
face
value
he
bona
fide
.
he
do
what
I
would
call
in
my
awkward
language
a
mapping
exercise
of
the
estimate
total
establishment
cost
by
species
in
2023
.
the
report
state
on
page
37
that
the
total
establishment
cost
for
a
conifer
plantation
will
be
approximately
€
7000
per
hectare
.
for
hard
broadleaf
,
it
be
to
be
€
10551
,
and
for
soft
broadleaf
it
be
to
be
€
9631
.
the
table
of
forestry
type
have
12
category
,
range
from
FT
1
to
FT
12
.
this
include
native
forest
,
forest
for
water
,
forest
on
public
land
,
emergent
forest
,
mix
high
forest
with
conifer
and
20
%
broadleaf
,
and
mix
high
forest
with
mainly
spruce
and
20
%
broadleaf
.
the
propose
grant
per
hectare
for
a
native
forest
be
€
6744
.
that
include
hard
broadleaf
.
the
establishment
cost
be
more
than
the
premium
devise
in
the
new
forestry
programme
.
therein
lie
the
challenge
.
the
propose
establishment
grant
for
mix
high
forest
with
mainly
spruce
and
20
%
broadleaf
be
€
3850
.
the
analysis
that
Professor
O'Donoghue
and
the
Auxilia
Group
have
do
be
base
on
real
-
time
receipt
they
have
be
furnish
with
.
they
be
the
live
and
true
experience
of
forestry
company
.
the
true
cost
of
establishment
be
far
in
excess
of
the
propose
grant
rate
for
establishment
.
already
there
be
a
disincentive
on
the
part
of
the
forestry
company
to
be
able
to
move
into
a
position
whereby
they
can
meet
the
need
of
the
new
forestry
programme
without
incur
loss
.
in
other
word
,
it
will
not
pay
the
forestry
company
and
contractor
to
become
involved
in
the
new
programme
because
the
financial
metric
be
such
that
it
be
too
expensive
for
they
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
if
I
be
look
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
somebody
who
want
to
invest
in
forestry
or
have
a
land
hold
on
which
there
be
forestry
,
I
would
look
at
the
premium
.
for
example
,
for
native
forest
the
figure
be
€
1103
.
I
would
consider
that
a
very
good
premium
per
hectare
if
I
be
go
to
benefit
from
it
.
however
,
the
nub
of
all
of
this
be
whether
forestry
company
,
which
establish
road
and
land
holding
,
use
forwarder
and
so
on
.
I
be
no
expert
in
this
area
but
if
they
be
tell
we
,
and
the
research
be
bear
out
what
we
be
hear
on
the
ground
,
that
the
cost
of
establishment
be
far
in
excess
of
the
grant
that
will
be
provide
,
then
I
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
Minister
of
State
may
already
be
on
the
back
foot
.
in
that
context
,
it
be
vitally
important
that
she
bring
together
all
of
the
stakeholder
.
the
establishment
of
a
forestry
development
agency
could
bring
all
of
the
stakeholder
together
.
we
have
such
a
agency
for
food
,
namely
Bord
Bia
,
or
employment
development
,
such
as
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
.
if
the
Minister
of
State
create
a
agency
to
bring
all
of
the
stakeholder
together
,
she
would
be
able
to
work
through
a
lot
of
this
issue
.
if
Coillte
be
go
to
change
the
manner
in
which
it
operate
such
that
it
will
be
able
to
benefit
from
premium
,
there
may
be
a
challenge
for
private
forestry
company
which
may
be
suck
into
operation
devise
by
Coillte
because
of
economy
of
scale
.
there
be
considerable
worry
about
that
within
the
private
forestry
sector
.
Ash
dieback
need
a
scheme
.
the
Minister
of
State
make
reference
to
it
,
and
I
be
glad
she
do
so
,
but
we
need
something
more
concrete
than
what
we
have
hear
heretofore
regard
a
ash
dieback
scheme
.
it
have
to
be
sort
.
if
we
want
confidence
in
the
sector
,
we
need
to
sort
out
the
ash
dieback
scheme
.
a
forestry
development
agency
will
be
the
mechanism
for
the
Minister
of
State
and
government
to
succeed
.
for
confidence
to
exist
,
we
need
to
bring
all
of
the
stakeholder
together
.
my
wish
be
that
the
Minister
of
State
move
forward
and
achieve
what
be
necessary
.
I
be
delighted
that
this
Bill
will
now
make
it
to
Committee
stage
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
support
the
Bill
and
for
allow
it
through
this
stage
.
I
also
thank
Deputy
Canney
and
Grealish
for
help
to
bring
the
Bill
this
distance
.
I
thank
Deputy
Donnelly
and
Cronin
for
they
positive
word
in
favour
of
animal
welfare
.
this
be
one
of
the
issue
which
very
much
unite
everybody
in
here
in
that
the
relationship
we
have
with
we
own
pet
be
key
and
important
one
.
it
be
also
important
that
I
put
my
own
dog
on
the
record
.
Rua
be
a
14
-
year
-
old
cross
between
a
red
setter
and
a
golden
retriever
.
he
be
still
go
strong
at
that
age
.
he
run
the
field
and
the
country
road
and
,
as
typical
for
a
dog
of
he
age
,
he
be
very
laid
back
.
he
be
henpeck
by
we
three
hen
.
they
get
a
treat
and
he
get
a
clean
,
which
be
probably
no
harm
for
they
.
the
cat
be
always
wreck
he
head
on
a
daily
basis
as
well
.
I
will
finish
with
one
story
where
I
be
remind
of
a
local
artist
in
Navan
,
Patsy
Reel
,
who
some
people
may
know
.
Patsy
Reel
have
a
lovely
dog
who
live
in
Ludlow
Street
in
Navan
.
that
dog
use
to
travel
three
street
up
the
town
by
himself
,
go
to
a
pedestrian
crossing
and
wait
for
somebody
to
hit
the
light
so
that
he
could
cross
the
road
.
he
would
then
go
to
the
pet
shop
and
bark
outside
it
and
the
pet
shop
owner
would
throw
he
out
a
treat
.
at
the
end
of
the
week
Patsy
Reel
would
go
up
to
the
pet
shop
and
pay
the
tab
himself
.
it
be
incredible
.
obviously
,
the
relationship
between
family
and
pet
be
very
important
.
it
be
fair
to
say
that
in
that
relationship
,
we
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
dog
and
owe
they
a
responsibility
to
ensure
that
they
be
protect
and
be
treat
humanely
.
unfortunately
,
the
reality
be
often
very
different
.
for
some
people
,
they
only
see
pet
and
dog
as
a
source
of
big
money
and
profit
,
and
of
enormous
exploitation
.
incredible
damage
be
do
to
dog
on
a
daily
basis
,
especially
breed
animal
,
include
injury
,
ill
-
health
,
lack
of
veterinary
treatment
when
it
be
need
,
no
space
at
all
to
be
the
animal
that
it
be
,
very
poor
diet
,
wet
,
cold
and
dirty
condition
,
and
isolation
.
if
we
build
a
relationship
with
pet
on
the
basis
of
that
wrong
,
unjust
and
evil
at
the
heart
of
it
it
be
a
sad
reflection
on
the
rest
of
society
.
it
be
important
that
this
Bill
play
a
role
in
improve
that
condition
over
the
long
term
.

I
totally
agree
that
the
role

be
a
vital
one
,
so
let
we
all
put
that
to
bed

and
more
of
they

but
if
there
be
only

they
can
only
cover

the
impediment
be
that
there
be
not
enough

ground

be
the
minister
satisfied
that
every
resident
of

State
have
access
,
as
need
be
,
to
a
CWO
?
I
appreciate
the
minister
's
commitment
to
service
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
,
which
be
set
out
in
statute
,
cover
everything
from
household
bill
to

related

,
clothing
,
funeral
expense
and
other
general
expense
,

expense
,

and
a
multitude
of
other
urgent
need
payment
.
I
welcome
the
assurance
by
the
minister
-
if
I
interpret
she
correctly
-
that
she
be
go
to
protect
that
,
and
that
no
element
of
that
that
be
non-statutory
will
be
take
away
.
it
be
vital
that
the
discretionary
element
of
the
payment
be
maintain
.
there
be
a
point
we
be
try
to
make
here
to
the
minister
.
if
I
move
outside

-----
this
be
now
a
service
where
people
be
be
force
into
the
Parnell
Street
office
.
it
take
the
service
further
away
from
the
people
.
will
the
minister
give
a
undertaking
to
conduct
a
analysis
of
the
community
welfare
service
as
it
relate
to
every
part
of
the
country
?
this
will
tell
we
whether
the
service
be
be
deliver
equally
to
all
citizen
.
I
welcome
that
additional
staff
be
be
deploy
.
as
someone
who
represent
both
a
urban
and
rural
constituency
,
I
want
to
see
the
traditional
,
old
-
style
,
face
-
to
-
face
interaction
,
and
I
believe
that
many
other
share
this
view
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
the
minister
around
the
right
of
people
to
have
access
to
a
person
where
they
can
make
a
appointment
.
if
,
however
,
the
caseload
be
75000
application
,
give
or
take
,
per
annum
,
if
I
interpret
the
minister
correctly
,
and
if
the
staff
quotient
be
about
412
,
the
caseload
per
officer
be
increase
,
and
it
have
become
more
centralise
into
hub
.
the
local
discretion
be
be
take
away
and
the
number
of
officer
in
more
remote
area
be
decrease
.
that
be
my
contention
base
on
my
first
-
hand
experience
.
it
be
more
a
observation
than
a
question
.
I
know
that
.
how
will
the
scheme
announce
under
the
social
Welfare
Act
2020
in
respect
of
uilleannn
pipe
maker
work
in
practical
term
?
the
minister
will
recall
that
I
very
much
welcome
this
in
the
context
of
the
social
Welfare
Bill
,
which
be
before
the
House
,
and
I
try
to
make
a
play
for
the
hurley
maker
in
a
similar
vein
on
the
basis
that
the
two
be
connect
by
dint
of
they
status
under
UNESCO
tangible
heritage
status
.
my
question
relate
to
hurley
maker
be
disallow
so
I
be
chance
my
arm
in
ask
this
question
and
raise
the
question
of
hurl
again
but
I
would
genuinely
like
to
know
how
this
scheme
will
work
in
practical
term
and
if
there
be
any
scope
for
the
hurley
maker
of
Ireland
to
be
include
in
a
similar
scheme

,
who
do
a
lot
of
work
in
the
background
in
seek
such
status
.
there
have
be
many
people
involved
in
this
for
many
year
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
to
this
and
the
government
's
proactive
approach
to
encourage
the
craft
of
uilleann
pipe
making
and
its
making
of
provision
in
the
tax
code
to
ensure
the
survival
of
the
craft
.
if
the
government
be
of
a
mind
to
consider
other
craft
such
as
hurley
making
,
it
would
be
very
much
welcome
.
if
the
minister
wish
to
take
up
the
cudgel
or
the
hurl
on
that
,
she
would
have
the
support
of
all
of
we
here
.
the
union
SIPTU
have
bring
to
we
attention
a
notice
of
strike
action
at
Zenith
Energy
Bantry
Bay
Terminal
Limited
.
that
strike
be
to
take
place
on
Tuesday
,
13
December
.
the
Whiddy
Island
terminal
have
17
oil
storage
tank
with
a
capacity
of
almost
9
million
barrel
and
store
a
significant
portion
of
the
State
's
oil
reserve
.
it
be
a
key
reference
site
nationally
.
the
National
Oil
Reserve
Agency
,
NORA
,
be
the
State
body
with
responsibility
for
maintain
we
strategic
supplies
of
oil
and
be
one
of
the
Whiddy
terminal
's
large
customer
.
Whiddy
Island
be
originally
build
in
the
late
1960
by
Gulf
Oil
to
accommodate
ultra
large
crude
oil
-
carry
vessel
.
we
all
remember
the
tragic
accident
where
51
people
die
in
January
1979
when
the
oil
tanker
Betelgeuse
explode
.
in
July
2001
,
the
business
and
commercial
asset
of
the
Irish
National
Petroleum
Corporation
,
INPC
,
be
sell
to
Tosco
corporation
,
now
Conoco
Phillips
,
and
NORA
do
not
form
part
of
that
transaction
.
Tosco
be
late
acquire
by
Phillips
66
.
NORA
be
establish
as
a
independent
statutory
body
in
2007
upon
the
introduction
of
the
National
Oil
reserve
Agency
Act
.
the
Whiddy
terminal
be
then
sell
to
Zenith
in
2015
.
in
2020
,
there
be
report
that
Zenith
intend
to
sell
the
strategic
facility
.
at
the
time
up
to
50
staff
be
employ
at
the
facility
in
January
2020
,
but
no
sale
occur
.
I
will
quote
directly
from
the
statement
issue
by
SIPTU
.
Willie
Noone
,
the
sector
organiser
,
state
:
a
ballot
for
strike
action
be
support
unanimously
by
we
member
and
be
schedule
to
commence
at
8.00
a.m.
on
Tuesday
,
13th
December
.
this
action
result
from
the
decision
of
the
company
[
Zenith
]
to
dismiss
worker
with
long
service
on
Wednesday
,
30th
November
,
while
plan
to
employ
contractor
on
a
ongoing
basis
to
do
they
work
.
the
union
,
and
the
worker
to
they
credit
,
see
this
as
a
last
resort
.
the
company
be
seek
compulsory
redundancy
.
effort
by
the
Workplace
Relation
Commission
,
WRC
,
to
resolve
the
dispute
be
unsuccessful
as
the
company
remain
insistent
that
contractor
be
use
to
cover
the
work
previously
do
by
the
worker
be
make
redundant
.
I
be
ask
for
the
government
to
intervene
on
the
basis
that
Zenith
be
house
within
a
key
reference
site
that
ensure
the
security
of
energy
supply
of
the
State
.
I
call
on
the
government
to
intervene
now
with
Zenith
to
at
least
bring
the
company
to
a
hearing
of
the
Labour
Court
so
that
the
matter
might
be
resolve
.
no
company
on
this
island
should
seek
to
drive
a
coach
and
four
through
the
industrial
relation
architecture
that
have
be
build
up
successfully
over
year
,
particularly
at
a
time
security
of
energy
supply
be
so
vital
and
particularly
give
that
this
people
have
a
combine
service
of
more
than
100
year
.
we
want
to
get
they
back
to
the
table
.
I
call
on
the
Minister
of
State
to
use
she
good
office
and
that
of
the
government
to
intervene
on
this
matter
to
encourage
people
back
to
the
table
.
I
be
disappointed
with
the
answer
.
the
Whiddy
Island
terminal
be
fix
firmly
in
the
consciousness
of
every
citizen
's
mind
as
key
in
the
security
of
energy
supply
.
there
would
have
be
a
time
when
somebody
like
I
would
have
get
up
as
a
member
of
the
Opposition
to
call
on
the
government
to
use
its
influence
specifically
in
relation
to
a
site
like
this
.
Zenith
have
a
contract
and
own
the
site
.
if
they
be
drive
a
coach
and
four
through
the
industrial
relation
architecture
,
a
Opposition
deputy
would
have
at
least
receive
a
response
that
express
sympathy
with
the
worker
down
there
.
we
do
not
want
worker
who
have
have
long
career
,
have
excellent
skill
set
,
be
highly
competent
and
be
highly
train
to
be
replace
while
they
go
out
on
strike
by
contractor
who
be
come
in
and
ultimately
be
design
to
take
they
place
.
there
be
a
time
in
this
house
when
a
minister
would
have
stand
opposite
I
and
not
give
I
the
answer
I
have
receive
tonight
.
I
know
what
NORA
do
.
the
dog
in
the
street
know
what
NORA
do
.
the
dog
in
the
street
can
make
the
distinction
between
NORA
and
Zenith
in
this
regard
.
I
want
to
protect
the
rights
of
pre-exist
worker
who
be
be
shovel
out
the
door
by
stealth
.
they
be
key
worker
for
this
island
,
give
what
they
do
at
the
terminal
.
I
worry
that
if
we
lose
they
skill
set
,
it
will
be
gone
and
lose
forever
.
I
be
merely
call
for
some
sympathy
and
empathy
on
the
part
of
the
government
for
the
worker
.
there
should
be
a
acknowledgement
by
the
government
of
the
need
to
call
on
all
side
,
particularly
the
owner
of
the
company
,
to
come
back
to
the
table
-
at
least
-
as
a
starting
point
.

I

''
.
I
tab
this
amendment
because
I
wish
to
raise
again
the
issue
of
community
welfare
officer
service
in
the
context
of
ensure
that
people
who
need
face
-
to
-
face
meeting
with
community
welfare
officer
will
have
that
option
available
to
they
.
I
appreciate
that
last
night
the
minister
categorically
state
that
such
a
service
exist
whereby
if
somebody
want
to
make
a
appointment
,
he
or
she
can
do
so
.
we
all
recognise
the
vital
service
that
community
welfare
officer
provide
.
there
be
a
sense
,
however
,
from
my
perspective
as
a
typical
constituency
deputy
,
that
there
be
place
throughout
this
state
where
this
service
exist
once
upon
a
time
but
where
it
no
long
exist
.
in
that
area
,
the
service
be
move
away
from
the
customer
.
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
be
extremely
important
.
the
figure
up
to
the
end
of
September
2022
show
that
there
be
a
range
of
service
provide
,
include
:
support
with
bill
;
child
-
related
payment
;
support
with
clothing
;
support
with
funeral
;
support
with
general
housing
need
;
illness
expense
;
and
urgent
need
payment
.
up
to
the
end
of
September
2022
,
nearly
€
40
million
be
pay
out
.
it
be
a
vital
service
of
which
we
be
all
very
protective
,
include
the
minister
,
because
it
get
money
to
people
who
need
it
the
most
:
that
who
be
at
a
risk
of
poverty
.
it
be
such
a
flexible
way
in
which
to
resource
people
who
so
badly
need
resource
across
a
plethora
of
payment
.
the
discretionary
element
of
it
be
so
vital
that
it
must
be
protect
.
the
basis
of
the
amendment
be
to
ask
that
the
minister
would
lay
a
report
before
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
on
the
current
prevail
level
of
provision
of
and
accessibility
to
community
welfare
officer
,
cwo
,
and
on
the
additional
recruitment
and
other
cost
that
would
be
entail
in
ensure
a
community
welfare
officer
be
available
for
consultation
by
member
of
the
public
in
all
social
welfare
office
during
ordinary
hour
of
business
.
the
minister
may
tell
we
that
people
have
access
to
Intreo
office
.
we
can
take
as
a
give
the
fact
that
most
people
have
transport
now
,
but
not
everybody
do
.
I
have
witness
scenario
where
people
do
not
have
access
to
either
public
or
private
transport
,
who
rely
on
taxi
.
for
they
to
move
away
from
the
clinic
type
arrangement
that
once
exist
to
now
have
to
go
to
they
near
town
,
which
could
be
20
kilometer
or
30
kilometer
away
,
to
avail
of
a
Intreo
service
put
the
service
that
bit
far
away
from
they
.
all
I
be
call
for
in
this
amendment
be
that
we
would
at
least
have
some
degree
of
a
assessment
of
how
the
service
be
work
and
recognise
the
importance
of
it
.
I
be
conscious
of
timing
.
I
will
be
guide
by
you
good
self
,
acting
chair
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
.
I
know
she
to
be
a
fair
-
minded
person
.
if
she
say
she
will
do
this
report
,
I
know
she
will
do
it
.
I
do
not
want
to
labour
the
point
too
much
,
except
to
say
that
I
and
the
Labour
Party
would
be
quite
protective
of
the
scheme
.
when
we
hear
of
unconfirmed
report
about
the
creation
of
hub
within
the
Department
itself
on
decision
-
make
procedure
,
dare
I
say
that
we
naturally
become
paranoid
and
suspicious
.
paranoia
in
politics
be
no
bad
thing
,
as
long
as
it
be
in
small
micro
dose
.
we
all
have
very
good
relationship
with
individual
officer
right
across
the
system
.
it
be
a
excellent
department
that
deliver
so
much
for
citizen
.
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
legislation
go
back
to
Frank
Cluskey
.
the
minister
will
appreciate
where
the
Labour
Party
stand
in
term
of
protect
the
supplementary
allowance
scheme
and
the
role
of
the
community
welfare
officer
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
response
and
on
that
basis
I
shall
not
press
the
amendment
.
I
be
quite
happy
to
withdraw
it
on
the
basis
of
the
commitment
I
have
be
give
.
I
move
amendment
no.

we
be
back
to
the
issue
of
report
but
,
unfortunately
,
we
be
now
restricted
to
that
in
legislation
of
this
nature
.
they
be
the
only
way
we
can
have
scope
to
push
back
at
the
government

on

the

state
:

a

the
earnings

from

410
to

441
in
section
4
be
design
to
take
account
of
the
forthcoming
increase

11.30
per

from
the
increase

national

will
continue
to
attract
the
low

the

seek
to
provide
for
some

of
how
that

on
both
the

in
term
of
the
potential
perceive
loss
of
real
income
as
a
result
of
the
increase
in
prsi
contribution
.
I
seek
some
clarity
from
the
minister
on
where
she
and
the
Department
be
in
respect
of
how
,
in
real
term
,
the
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
will
work
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
a
negative
impact
,
in
real
term
,
on
real
income
whereby
increase
wage
will
be
offset
by
increase
in
prsi
.
I
anticipate
the
minister
will
tell
I
that
,
in
real
term
,
that
will
not
be
the
case
and
there
be
a
provision
for
that
,
but
in
put
forward
the
amendment
I
be
seek
further
clarity
on
whether
,
if
there
be
to
be
a
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
,
it
will
be
worthwhile
for
a
employee
to
receive
that
increase
whereby
it
will
not
be
take
away
in
taxation
.
I
be
a
former
minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Jobs
,
Enterprise
and
Innovation
if
that
be
what
the
minister
mean
.
it
be
not
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
the
taper
tax
relief
be
the
nub
of
it
.
I
do
not
propose
to
withdraw
the
amendment
.
I
propose
to
press
it
because
I
think
it
be
vital
.
I
note

minister
's
response
with
regard
to
the
work
that
be
ongoing
with
the
CSO
,
Revenue
and
various

Department

I
want
to
ensure
that
taper

issue
be
essentially
nail
down
,
however
.
obviously
,
there
be
a
impact
for
the
employer
as
well
that
cannot
be

,
particularly
for
small

and

it
be

therefore
,
my
intention
to
press

I
appreciate
that

with
all
due

to
the

the
generosity
of

I
think
I
would

it

to
.
I
wholeheartedly
support
deputy
Naughten
's
propose
amendment
because
more
of
we
be
interact
with
people
who
be
definitively
feel
the
effect
of
long
Covid
.
the
amendment
be
a
reasonable
one
in
that
it
seek
to
have
a
report
lay
before
the
House
on
particular
measure
,
especially
,
as
state
in
the
amendment
,
in
designate
long
Covid
as
a
occupational
illness
.
we
all
have
first
-
hand
experience
,
base
on
we
interaction
with
we
constituent
,
particularly
front
-
line
worker
.
if
something
can
be
devise
or
construct
to
recognise
that
formally
within
the
Department
of
social
Protection
to
ensure
there
be
a
payment
process
in
recognition
of
it
,
that
would
be
wholeheartedly
welcome
.
I
support
deputy
Kerrane
's
amendment
.
this
be
a
time
when
the
government
,
to
be
fair
to
it
,
and
the
Minister
for
further
and
High
Education
,
Research
,
Innovation
and
Science
,
deputy
Harris
,
be
put
particular
emphasis
on
apprenticeship
.
there
be
now
a
clear
government
policy
around
resourcing
apprenticeship
.
we
want
to
see
more
apprenticeship
come
from
right
across
the
demographic
spectrum
,
particularly
in
instance
where
people
have
not
attain
point
for
third
level
institution
and
they
may
be
think
about
apprenticeship
to
create
that
environment
where
they
be
encourage
to
take
up
apprenticeship
without
the
loss
of
any
element
of
they
household
income
.
in
that
context
,
I
support
the
amendment
.
I
move
amendment
no.

it

I

like

I
find
he
to
be
a
warm
-
hearted
and
decent
person
who
be
collegiate

he
be
partisan
in
the
sense
that
he
be
staunch
Fianna

but
he
be
the
type
of
person
you
could
work
with
and
he
be
decent
,
affable

amiable
.
we
all
miss

it

hard
not

we
be
deeply
sorry

.
he
will
be

there
be
other

from
across

land
who
remember
he
fondly
as
a
decent

.
I
extend
we
deep
sympathy
to
the
Aylward
family
.
I
appreciate
the
deputy
's
kind
word
.
I
have
enjoy
be
the
minister
for
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
employment
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
year
and
work
with
IDA

Enterprise
Ireland
and
the
local
enterprise
office
,
leo
,
to
create
job
around
the
country
and
improve
worker
's
rights
.
I
have
enjoy
work
with
the
three
minister
of
State
who
have
serve
with
I
in
introduce
some
major
legislative
reform
in
the
area
of

establish

and
do
many
other
thing
in
that
period
,
which
have
really
fly
.
I
will
be
around
tomorrow
and
will
be
take
leader
's
question
on
Thursday
so
I
have
a
number
of
dáil
appearance
before
Saturday
.
to
answer
the
question
,
which
be
the
most
important
thing
,
IDA
Ireland
have
a
role
to
play
when
it
come
to
promote
good
rail
access
and
good
public
transport
to
industrial
park
.
IDA
Ireland
get
very
involved
in
air
connectivity
,
which
we
all
know
be
very
important
.
perhaps
it
need
to
get
a
little
more
involved
in
think
about
how
people
get
in
and
out
of
industrial
site
because
they
do
not
always
travel
by
car
.
there
be
definitely
a
opportunity
in
that
regard
and
I
will
make
sure
it
be
on
my
agenda
for
future
discussion
with
the
agency
.
I
thank
deputy
Nash
for
share
time
.
I
will
read
into
the
record
some
of
the
content
of
a
email
I
receive
on
Monday
from
a
Mr.
Justin
Moran
of
Wind
Energy
Ireland
in
respect
of
its
concern
about
the
foreshore
aspect
of
this
Bill
.
we
industry
be
concerned
that
the
effect
of
what
be
propose
will
be
to
slow
the
development
of
renewable
energy
and
undermine
effort
to
deliver
the
legally
bind
carbon
emission
reduction
require
by
the
Climate
Action
and
low
Carbon
development
(
amendment
)
Act
2021
.
this
be
because
the
act
,
by
widen
the
definition
of
the
foreshore
to
include
the
water
column
above
the
seabed
,
will
now
require
any
project
wish
to
carry
out
non-invasive
geophysical
survey
activity
in
the
water
above
the
foreshore
to
obtain
a
Foreshore
Site
investigation
licence
to
do
so
,
even
though
this
activity
be
already
regulate
by
the
National
Parks
&
Wildlife
Service
.
since
it
be
take
more
than
2
year
to
get
such
a
licence
the
actual
effect
of
this
act
will
be
to
block
any
new
geophysical
survey
activity
by
renewable
energy
project
until
the
establishment
of
the
maritime
Area
Regulatory
Authority
in
Q2
of
2023
.
we
lose
time
,
when
we
have
none
to
lose
.
Mr.
Moran
go
on
to
state
that
he
be
write
to
I
to
ask
I
and
,
by
inference
,
the
minister
to
support
the
recommendation
contain
in
the
Joint
Committee
on
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
's
pre-legislative
scrutiny
report
on
the
general
scheme
of
the
Bill
.
the
relevant
quote
from
that
report
be
:
the
committee
recommend
that
the
Department
obtain
and
publish
expert
legal
advice
and
stakeholder
consultation
,
namely
,
with
marine
environmental
stakeholder
,
the
fishing
community
,
and
the
offshore
renewable
energy
industry
,
so
as
to
inform
the
provision
of
safeguard
in
respect
of
the
amendment
in
Head
9
of
the
General
Scheme
.
the
email
,
which
I
be
sure
the
minister
have
,
and
he
certainly
have
be
make
aware
of
it
,
go
on
to
state
:
as
part
of
we
submission
to
the
pre-legislative
Scrutiny
of
the
Bill
we
request
a
legal
opinion
on
the
General
Scheme
which
be
provide
by
Arthur
Cox
and
which
be
give
to
the
committee
.
I
would
be
happy
to
share
it
with
you
...
[
etc
.
]
the
legal
opinion
state
:
we
expect
that
the
rationale
behind
this
be
to
facilitate
the
licencing
of
geophysical
survey
which
take
place
in
the
water
column
.
however
,
it
be
not
clear
why
such
survey
require
regulation
,
as
part
of
the
foreshore
licensing
process
,
when
that
survey
be
already
regulate
by
another
process
.
that
be
the
question
Wind
Energy
Ireland
be
ask
.
if
we
have
some
response
to
that
in
reply
to
this
debate
,
we
would
be
grateful
.
the
email
go
on
to
state
:
this
make
it
all
the
more
confusing
that
a
Bill
be
be
advance
to
amend
the
Foreshore
act
to
regulate
a
already
regulate
form
of
survey
activity
when
it
will
slow
the
development
of
offshore
wind
energy
which
will
serve
only
to
increase
carbon
emission
and
we
dependency
on
import
fossil
fuel
.
we
need
MARA
to
succeed
but
we
want
the
process
now
to
be
such
that
they
be
streamline
and
do
not
create
any
impediment
to
the
development
of
offshore
wind
so
as
to
increase
the
potential
for
energy
independence
on
this
island
.
that
be
ultimately
what
this
email
be
about
.
I
will
certainly
endeavour
to
ensure
that
the
Department
keep
the
family
update
regard
any
development
I
would
expect
to
happen
.
I
would
expect
that
a
Garda
Síochána
will
do
likewise
.
as
the
deputy
note
,
a
Garda
liaison
officer
have
be
appoint
.
of
course
,
we
think
of
all
that
who
lose
they
life
in
the
immediate
event
of
all
this
bombing
where
people
be
viciously
murder
and
injure
.
many
who
do
not
die
in
the
immediate
event
go
on
to
suffer
very
serious
consequence
and
may
have
have
they
life
shorten
.
the
announcement
by
a
Garda
Síochána
in
October
that
a
number
of
line
of
inquiry
have
be
identify
with
regard
to
the
Belturbet
bombing
and
that
a
senior
investigate
officer
have
be
appoint
to
lead
the
investigation
show
the
commitment
of
the
Garda
authority
to
this
legacy
case
.
despite
the
length
of
time
,
we
have
not
forget
and
a
Garda
Síochána
will
continue
to
investigate
.
it
be
almost
50
year
since
that
terrible
day
when
two
family
lose
they
love
one
forever
and
many
other
be
injure
.
hope
can
and
must
remain
for
that
family
that
the
perpetrator
can
be
bring
to
justice
.
the
government
's
approach
to
legacy
and
reconciliation
have
always
be
that
it
should
be
victim
-
cent
,
take
the
Stormont
House
agreement
as
its
starting
point
.
the
UK
's
legacy
Bill
,
which
seek
to
introduce
a
amnesty
for
crime
commit
during
the
trouble
,
risk
severely
damage
the
process
of
reconciliation
in
Northern
Ireland
and
here
.
it
be
the
firm
view
of
this
government
that
this
path
must
remain
open
to
victim
,
survivor
and
they
family
.
I
again
call
on
anybody
with
any
information
that
may
be
relevant
to
this
case
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
a
Garda
Síochána
to
aid
its
investigation
.
what
of
the

I
welcome
the
motion
,
which
we
support
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
bona
fide
of
the
minister
opposite
in
try
to
fix
a
perennial
problem
.
I
read
the
minister
's
speech
carefully
but
feel
that
there
be
much
more
that
can
be
do
to
increase
capacity
.
the
minister
refer
to
the
investment
in
diagnostics
and
primary
care
in
particular
.
it
be
all
well
and
good
to
state
that
the
HSE
have
add
90
additional
primary
care
team
in
the
country
but
there
be
still
a
issue
in
that
people
in
the
constituency
I
represent
cannot
get
to
the
gp
in
the
first
instance
.
the
diagnostic
piece
do
not
,
therefore
,
arise
.
I
be
tell
by
my
constituent
in
the
town
of
Mitchelstown
,
where
we
have
a
excellent
primary
care
centre
,
that
they
be
wait
up
to
two
or
three
week
-
four
week
in
one
instance
-
to
see
or
interact
with
a
gp
in
a
primary
care
centre
.
I
be
not
here
to
criticise
gps
.
they
be
absolutely
snow
under
.
we
know
that
.
however
,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
minister
,
until
such
time
as
people
can
get
access
to
the
gp
in
the
first
instance
,
the
issue
of
diagnostics
be
moot
.
I
need
to
know
how
we
be
go
to
fix
that
.
that
be
the
problem
that
I
need
to
see
fix
.
we
know
what
the
latent
effect
of
people
not
get
access
to
basic
gp
service
in
the
first
instance
be
.
it
just
heap
up
a
pile
of
problem
for
the
long
term
.
if
there
be
no
access
to
diagnostics
,
it
just
shore
up
a
pile
of
problem
down
the
line
.
I
need
answer
to
the
question
I
have
in
respect
of
Mitchelstown
.
the
situation
be
similar
in
Mallow
.
it
be
not
just
Mitchelstown
and
Mallow
,
but
every
town
in
the
country
.
why
be
it
that
people
now
have
to
wait
so
long
to
get
access
to
the
gp
?
I
do
not
blame
gps
.
we
be
very
quick
to
blame
.
we
need
to
blame
somebody
for
problem
.
however
,
where
be
the
solution
to
that
problem
?
as
a
local
deputy
,
I
,
for
one
,
have
do
a
lot
of
work
with
some
of
the
gp
practice
in
my
area
to
try
to
assist
they
with
visa
for
gps
come
in
from
third
country
or
from
outside
the
European
Union
.
we
have
have
some
measure
of
success
there
.
many
people
be
now
emigrate
and
take
up
job
opportunity
elsewhere
.
if
the
government
and
the
HSE
be
to
take
a
proactive
approach
to
recruiting
from
across
the
globe
-
there
be
precedent
for
this
and
it
be
be
do
day
in
and
day
out
-
we
could
bring
in
gps
from
other
country
,
which
would
help
alleviate
the
problem
in
place
like
Mitchelstown
and
Mallow
.
that
be
one
possible
solution
.
with
regard
to
out
-
of
-
hour
service
,
throughout
the
Christmas
period
,
we
all
receive
call
from
people
who
could
not
get
access
to
service
such
as
that
in
my
area
,
SouthDoc
.
SouthDoc
be
a
excellent
service
.
once
you
get
in
the
door
and
be
see
,
it
be
the
good
service
in
the
world
but
there
be
the
question
of
get
that
initial
access
.
I
know
of
some
very
acute
case
that
arise
over
the
Christmas
period
in
particular
.
I
do
not
have
a
degree
in
medicine
and
be
not
qualified
to
diagnose
but
,
if
I
be
contact
by
a
anxious
parent
who
be
seek
access
to
the
service
for
a
three
-
year
-
old
,
who
have
be
wait
six
,
seven
,
eight
,
nine
or
ten
hour
for
a
call
back
from
the
out
-
of
-
hour
service
and
who
do
not
want
to
go
to
the
emergency
department
because
they
be
petrified
of
go
to
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
we
have
a
serious
structural
problem
.
be
that
also
about
the
supply
of
gps
?
can
we
get
more
gps
?
the
minister
will
say
that
SouthDoc
,
Westdoc
or
the
service
in
whatever
part
of
the
country
one
might
be
from
operate
on
a
co-operative
basis
but
the
HSE
and
the
taxpayer
be
also
big
funder
of
this
service
.
we
have
skin
in
the
game
and
,
as
such
,
I
be
sure
that
we
have
influence
at
a
ministerial
level
over
how
this
service
operate
.
all
I
want
for
my
constituent
be
access
to
a
gp
when
they
need
it
because
,
once
someone
get
in
the
door
of
a
primary
care
centre
and
get
access
to
a
gp
,
a
lot
of
triage
can
be
do
,
reduce
the
need
for
people
to
present
to
the
accident
and
emergency
department
in
CUH
.
do
not
get
I
start
on
CUH
.
I
be
there
with
somebody
recently
and
see
the
ambulance
back
up
and
the
lack
of
bed
.
that
be
again
a
structural
problem
but
it
do
not
just
arise
because
of
RSV
or
Covid
because
the
trolley
number
be
now
up
in
the
month
of
June
and
July
as
well
.
there
be
evidence
for
that
.
it
be
a
year
-
round
thing
.
when
you
look
at
the
face
of
healthcare
professional
,
which
the
minister
have
see
,
include
nurse
,
doctor
,
attendant
and
people
work
on
the
floor
,
you
see
that
they
be
all
stress
out
to
the
hilt
.
that
be
not
sustainable
.
I
genuinely
worry
for
the
health
of
we
healthcare
professional
at
the
moment
.
I
genuinely
worry
that
many
of
they
be
now
say
they
have
have
enough
,
they
cannot
take
any
more
and
they
be
out
.
it
be
hard
to
blame
they
.
we
need
to
try
to
alleviate
the
pressure
.
there
be
another
way
of
alleviate
the
pressure
.
level
2
hospital
be
a
untapped
resource
.
take
Mallow
General
Hospital
for
example
.
the
minister
speak
to
issue
around
capital
expenditure
and
turn
brick
and
mortar
into
ward
.
we
have
a
42
-
bed
unit
in
Mallow
General
Hospital
that
be
all
but
build
.
the
hospital
be
operate
excellently
.
it
provide
a
great
deal
of
elective
care
for
people
.
it
be
excellent
in
diagnostics
.
many
people
could
be
triage
on
a
out
-
of
-
hour
basis
and
direct
into
hospital
like
Mallow
General
Hospital
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
fast
-
track
the
42
-
bed
unit
.
we
would
get
it
up
and
run
for
the
minister
.
we
would
take
people
out
of
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
and
move
they
into
Mallow
General
Hospital
,
as
well
as
place
like
Ennis
and
Nenagh
hospital
and
other
hospital
.
the
excellent
staff
on
the
ground
will
do
what
the
minister
have
speak
about
in
term
of
deliver
the
healthcare
we
need
.
that
would
alleviate
the
pressure
on
CUH
and
this
can
be
do
now
.
the
brick
and
mortar
be
there
.
I
invite
the
minister
to
visit
Mallow
to
take
a
look
at
it
for
himself
.
it
be
a
excellent
hospital
.
the
writing
be
on
the
wall
for
the
accident
and
emergency
department
a
long
time
ago
.
we
do
a
lot
of
work
in
respect
of
build
out
endoscopy
suite
,
medical
assessment
unit
,
a
local
injury
unit
,
a
urgent
care
centre
,
etc
.
we
now
have
a
42
-
bed
unit
and
if
the
minister
will
give
we
the
money
to
put
bed
into
it
,
we
will
do
the
business
for
he
.
that
be
what
we
want
to
do
in
Mallow
.
this
would
take
a
great
deal
of
pressure
,
from
a
regional
perspective
,
off
tertiary
care
centre
like
CUH
.
it
will
not
only
serve
the
people
of
Mallow
but
also
that
in
Tipperary
,
Limerick
,
Waterford
and
the
whole
catchment
area
.
if
we
look
at
Mallow
on
the
map
,
we
will
see
it
be
right
in
the
heart
of
Munster
.
this
be
what
we
be
talk
about
in
term
of
solution
.
the
minister
have
the
capability
,
wherewithal
and
means
to
do
this
because
he
be
the
minister
.
if
he
could
take
a
look
at
Mallow
General
Hospital
specifically
,
we
could
do
a
job
of
work
there
.
we
also
need
to
talk
about
ambulance
care
.
we
be
all
deeply
worried
about
people
who
work
in
the
ambulance
service
.
they
be
stress
out
as
well
.
they
be
be
ask
to
do
double
shift
and
take
on
extra
work
.
I
fear
for
they
health
and
safety
.
in
the
not
-
too
-
distant
past
,
we
have
a
case
where
somebody
go
home
from
do
a
shift
crash
because
they
be
just
absolutely
wreck
tired
,
to
use
my
local
parlance
and
to
speak
in
the
vernacular
.
we
just
cannot
have
that
.
person
need
to
have
adequate
rest
between
shift
.
we
cannot
have
a
situation
where
we
be
try
to
squeeze
more
and
more
hour
of
healthcare
professional
because
at
some
stage
it
become
dangerous
for
they
and
the
people
they
be
treat
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
take
a
look
at
this
aspect
.
in
the
few
second
I
have
leave
,
I
will
speak
about
pharmacy
,
which
be
yet
another
untapped
resource
.
community
pharmacy
have
tremendous
capacity
to
deliver
,
if
they
could
be
build
out
to
deliver
more
at
the
community
level
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
the
minister
may
be
do
some
work
in
this
area
already
.
I
ask
he
to
fast
-
track
that
.
pharmacist
be
excellent
.
they
provide
excellent
advice
to
people
in
they
community
daily
and
they
could
do
much
more
if
they
be
give
the
training
and
resource
.
increase
capacity
will
require
resource
.
I
think
the
minister
be
say
there
be
a
budget
of
€
23
billion
.
what
we
be
seek
for
the
few
small
thing
I
have
mention
would
not
be
big
money
at
all
.
the
minister
could
do
it
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
she
advocacy
in
this
regard
.
I
can
hear
the
passion
when
she
talk
about
this
matter
.
domestic
violence
have
increase
and
have
in
fact
double
in
the
past
15
year
.
in
my
previous
life
as
a
family
lawyer
,
l
deal
with
many
woman
,
and
some
man
,
who
be
victim
of
domestic
violence
.
Ms
Sarah
Grace
have
speak
very
eloquently
on
the
criminal
justice
system
.
I
could
use
the
term
"
in
part
"
,
but
to
a
large
extent
many
victim
do
not
come
forward
because
of
they
fear
of
the
criminal
justice
system
and
face
that
.
the
fact
that
we
now
have
Garda
training
will
help
a
lot
.
Gardaí
be
well
equip
in
how
to
deal
with
this
violence
.
judge
also
need
training
to
deal
with
victim
,
and
to
make
the
process
more
victim
friendly
and
victim
cent
,
so
there
be
not
that
fear
and
,
primarily
,
that
the
woman
be
believe
.
much
legislation
have
be
bring
in
relate
to
this
area
,
such
as
Coco
's
Law
.
there
be
now
legislation
around
coercive
control
,
which
the
deputy
mention
,
and
consent
,
which
do
not
even
exist
when
I
be
grow
up
.
we
have
make
huge
stride
but
this
be
,
as
it
be
call
in
France
,
the
grande
cause
nationale
.
it
be
something
that
will
never
go
away
.
we
have
to
stop
it
at
its
grassroots
level
before
it
become
something
really
violent
,
similar
to
what
happen
to
Ashling
Murphy
and
the
more
than
200
woman
who
have
die
since
1996
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
she
effort
on
this
issue
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Harris
,
have
a
zero
-
tolerance
approach
to
domestic
,
sexual
and
gender
-
base
violence
,
as
do
the
government
.
for
my
part
,
I
will
also
continue
to
advocate
.
I
thank
deputy
Kelly
for
share
time
.
the
Coillte
-
Gresham
House
partnership
seem
wrong
on
many
level
.
it
be
a
arrangement
which
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
facilitate
the
expatriation
of
million
of
euro
from
Irish
taxpayer
's
pocket
into
the
hand
of
fund
manager
and
on
that
basis
,
let
I
state
that
we
vehemently
oppose
this
arrangement
.
the
taxpayer
will
not
benefit
by
one
penny
from
this
entity
and
the
language
use
to
describe
how
much
land
will
be
acquire
have
vary
from
anywhere
between
3000
ha
,
such
as
we
have
hear
here
tonight
,
to
100000
ha
when
Mr.
Carlin
start
talk
about
this
two
week
ago
.
we
do
not
know
exactly
how
much
land
will
be
acquire
.
moreover
,
as
I
understand
it
-----
-----
and
I
have
the
right
to
speak
here
through
the
chair
,
the
upper
limit
on
how
much
land
will
be
acquire
have
not
be
absolutely
and
definitely
define
.
who
know
how
much
land
will
be
acquire
and
it
will
have
the
effect
of
displace
farmer
from
farming
activity
.
it
be
on
that
basis
that
we
absolutely
oppose
it
.
in
other
word
,
this
entity
be
hell
-
bend
on
acquire
as
much
land
as
it
can
grab
and
right
now
,
neither
the
Irish
taxpayer
nor
the
government
have
any
say
or
control
whatsoever
.
the
government
be
asleep
at
the
wheel
on
this
one
.
it
would
not
have
happen
on
anybody
else
's
watch
within
this
House
.
the
government
let
it
happen
and
do
not
put
a
halt
to
it
and
it
now
seem
that
it
be
sign
,
seal
and
deliver
.
it
be
a
awful
travesty
that
we
would
facilitate
in
this
country
a
situation
where
a
financial
house
from
the
UK
could
come
in
and
acquire
so
much
Irish
land
or
have
the
potential
to
do
so
.
it
will
walk
away
with
the
premia
,
let
there
no
doubt
about
it
.
the
forester
be
the
people
I
feel
sorry
for
in
all
of
this
,
because
they
will
end
up
be
price
-
taker
even
though
we
know
they
plant
all
of
the
forestry
in
this
country
at
present
.
once
you
start
acquire
more
land
,
you
start
acquire
control
of
the
means
of
production
and
once
you
start
control
this
,
then
you
can
set
the
price
.
before
we
know
it
,
private
forester
will
end
up
be
price
-
taker
and
many
of
they
will
become
enslave
to
this
new
entity
.
that
be
the
danger
I
fear
around
what
be
be
create
here
.
it
be
a
beast
over
which
there
will
be
no
control
.
the
dubious
assertion
of
the
Minister
,
Deputy
McConalogue
and
Eamon
Ryan
,
and
the
Minister
of
State
,
Senator
Hackett
,
that
Coillte
be
need
to
reach
the
8,000
ha
afforestation
target
,
may
be
true
.
I
do
not
think
anybody
would
argue
against
that
but
it
be
a
fallacy
to
assert
that
the
creation
of
this
Gresham
House
-
Coillte
entity
be
the
way
forward
to
achieve
the
8,000
ha
afforestation
target
.
we
know
the
national
afforestation
programme
be
carry
out
each
year
by
the
private
forestry
sector
.
here
you
have
a
Labour
Party
deputy
stand
up
in
defence
of
the
private
forestry
sector
because
we
see
chapter
and
verse
what
it
be
do
on
the
ground
in
term
of
put
plant
into
the
ground
and
how
they
be
try
to
manage
against
the
tooth
of
a
forestry
service
that
be
,
quite
frankly
,
not
fit
for
purpose
.
the
metric
be
proof
of
that
because
only
4779
ha
have
be
approve
for
planting
but
44766
ha
have
be
approve
for
felling
.
we
be
cut
down
more
tree
than
we
be
planting
in
this
country
,
and
it
pain
I
to
say
it
,
on
the
Green
Party
's
watch
.
that
be
the
sad
reality
of
it
.
the
fact
speak
for
themselves
.
if
you
read
the
dashboard
that
everybody
read
,
which
be
the
state
documentation
that
everybody
agree
be
the
industry
standard
-----
----
they
figure
be
there
.
I
will
finish
my
speech
uninterrupted
,
if
I
may
,
because
I
have
only
25
second
leave
.
the
government
fall
asleep
at
the
wheel
on
this
one
.
they
be
out
the
gap
on
this
one
but
there
may
be
hope
for
the
government
to
politically
use
whatever
might
and
main
it
can
to
pull
this
back
from
the
brink
because
we
do
not
want
a
situation
where
taxpayer
's
money
by
way
of
premia
,
end
up
in
London
or
wherever
,
on
the
back
and
through
the
sweat
of
the
Irish
forestry
sector
.
if
the
government
work
with
farmer
and
with
the
Irish
forestry
sector
,
it
can
deliver
on
its
target
and
within
the
means
it
have
at
its
disposal
but
it
must
be
look
at
.
I
ask
the
government
to
please
revise
this
decision
.
the
metric
speak
from
themselves
.
the
minister
be
cut
down
more
tree
than
he
be
planting
.
I
completely
appreciate
the
point
make
by
both
deputy
,
particularly
on
auditing
.
this
scheme
be
devise
under
a
European
framework
and
be
also
subject
to
state
aid
rule
so
it
be
not
simply
I
,
the
Department
or
a
lack
of
desire
.
it
be
construct
under
the
state
aid
rule
as
a
particular
intervention
measure
,
all
of
which
we
must
comply
with
.
therefore
,
please
do
not
let
I
go
further
than
I
can
in
any
of
that
.
the
minister
have
say
he
will
look
at
the
operation
of
the
scheme
,
in
broad
term
,
to
see
if
there
be
way
in
which
it
can
be
adapt
for
in
the
future
.
the
deputy
be
correct
to
point
out
the
impact
week
or
month
of
difficulty
can
have
on
the
viability
of
any
business
.
I
refer
,
in
particular
,
to
many
tourism
interest
that
find
it
difficult
to
attract
business
over
the
winter
period
.
when
one
look
at
the
scheme
and
how
it
have
operate
versus
expectation
,
one
must
also
consider
energy
price
and
where
they
be
relative
to
expectation
.
despite
they
have
be
extraordinarily
high
,
energy
price
be
much
low
than
we
have
expect
at
this
time
of
year
both
because
of
change
in
energy
price
in
respect
of
oil
and
gas
generally
on
the
wholesale
market
,
and
the
considerably
warm
than
expect
weather
for
the
period
.
this
have
mean
that
bill
,
while
they
be
exceptionally
high
during
the
August
-
September
period
-
which
I
see
in
my
own
constituency
-
have
not
be
as
high
as
might
have
be
expect
.
by
way
of
additional
detail
,
wholesale
gas
price
be
expect
to
be
57
%
low
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
than
they
would
have
be
expect
to
be
last
October
.
of
course
,
the
winter
period
be
not
over
and
gas
and
oil
price
remain
considerably
high
,
but
it
be
worth
make
the
point
that
they
be
low
.
we
continue
to
urge
eligible
business
to
make
claim
under
the
scheme
.
the
window
for
make
claim
be
important
.
Revenue
have
endeavour
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
.
I
appreciate
that
this
speak
to
the
application
of
the
scheme
more
broadly
and
not
to
the
specific
point
raise
by
the
Deputy
in

of
the
exclusion

the
recommendation
therein
.
I
be
particularly
take
by
the
part
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
where
she
refer
to
CAMHS
team
.
she
say
:
CAMHS
team
receive
and
triage
nearly
21000
referral
annually
and
deliver
225000
appointment
for
child
and
young
people
require
assessment
and
intervention
each
year
.
between
2020
and
2021
,
CAMH
service
have
experience
a
33
%
increase
in
demand
,
while
concurrently
increase
they
activity
level
,
see
21
%
more
case
during
the
same
period
.
they
be
extraordinary
figure
when
you
think
about
it
.
they
present
a
picture
of
the
enormity
of
the
challenge
that
face
all
of
we
in
respect
of
ensure
that
,
where
somebody
need
access
to
a
service
in
a
acute
setting
or
on
a
acute
basis
,
they
have
that
pathway
within
that
24
to
48
hour
period
.
when
there
be
a
threat
to
life
,
there
be
so
many
pathway
to
save
a
life
in
conventional
medicine
.
if
there
be
a
road
traffic
accident
,
the
ambulance
be
call
,
you
go
to
the
near
trauma
centre
and
the
resource
be
there
to
save
life
and
limb
straight
away
.
when
it
come
to
mental
health
,
it
be
just
not
there
.
it
be
not
guarantee
to
the
same
extent
.
I
have
sympathy
for
the
position
in
which
the
Minister
of
State
find
themselves
.
if
I
be
Sinn
Féin
I
would
not
be
make
promise
or
guarantee
be
able
to
fix
this
because
it
will
be
a
long
,
slow
road
.
however
,
the
Mental
Health
Commission
's
report
be
very
clear
in
respect
of
the
regulation
of
camh
.
this
have
always
be
a
key
point
for
we
.
there
be
a
inconsistency
in
the
service
depend
on
where
people
live
in
the
country
.
I
live
in
CHO
4
.
the
figure
for
CHO
4
,
which
be
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
,
be
frightening
.
I
raise
this
in
a
parliamentary
question
to
the
Minister
for
Health
and
get
my
reply
on
25
January
.
I
ask
for
the
number
of
person
wait
to
be
see
by
child
and
adolescent
mental
health
service
by
CHO
and
LHO
and
the
length
of
time
they
be
wait
.
there
be
857
people
wait
in
total
in
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
.
that
be
too
many
people
.
there
be
296
wait
over
a
year
in
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
.
this
be
from
25
January
so
that
be
the
most
up
-
to
-
date
figure
there
be
.
there
be
a
glaring
inconsistency
between
what
be
happen
in
the
Cork
and
Kerry
region
and
the
Galway
region
,
if
I
be
be
a
bit
cheeky
about
it
,
or
the
Waterford
region
.
the
figure
be
incomparable
.
in
CHO
1
,
the
Donegal
region
,
there
be
603
people
wait
long
than
12
month
whereas
in
CHO
2
,
the
Galway
region
or
the
west
of
Ireland
,
there
be
24
.
to
go
back
to
my
early
point
,
if
someone
present
to
a
hospital
with
a
acute
medical
condition
,
they
will
get
they
surgery
or
intervention
,
they
will
get
the
medicine
they
need
and
they
will
get
it
pretty
much
straight
away
once
they
be
inside
the
door
of
the
hospital
,
primary
care
setting
or
secondary
care
setting
.
when
it
come
to
mental
health
service
for
child
and
adolescent
,
that
same
level
of
urgency
do
not
exist
.
the
point
make
by
the
Mental
Health
Commission
on
the
regulation
of
CAMHS
be
important
because
we
need
that
consistency
of
approach
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
say
that
the
revise
mental
health
Bill
should
make
provision
for
that
.
I
be
not
sure
where
that
Bill
be
or
when
it
be
suppose
to
come
before
we
-
I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
respond
to
that
question
-
but
that
provision
need
to
be
nail
down
.
it
be
not
fair
that
the
people
in
Cork
and
Kerry
have
to
wait
so
much
long
than
people
in
another
part
of
the
country
.
we
should
not
have
that
inconsistency
.
the
service
should
not
discriminate
against
people
base
on
they
geography
.
we
all
face
scenario
as
public
representative
,
deputy
and
Senator
,
on
a
daily
basis
where
family
approach
we
.
we
pick
up
the
phone
to
the
chief
officer
of
the
CHO
or
whoever
it
might
be
.
this
be
all
inherently
good
people
who
want
to
help
we
.
in
some
case
,
it
have
take
my
intervention
with
somebody
of
standing
within
the
HSE
on
behalf
of
a
family
to
get
access
to
a
service
.
family
member
tell
I
about
a
young
man
or
woman
who
have
suicidal
ideation
and
after
my
intervention
,
a
appointment
be
make
and
the
young
person
in
question
be
back
in
the
system
.
if
the
system
be
work
correctly
,
it
would
not
take
a
intervention
by
a
deputy
,
Senator
or
councillor
for
someone
to
get
access
to
a
service
.
that
be
wrong
.
there
be
many
people
out
there
-
and
I
do
not
mean
this
in
a
patronising
way
-
who
may
not
have
the
capacity
to
advocate
or
the
wherewithal
to
phone
they
local
public
representative
.
they
should
not
have
to
do
that
to
get
access
to
a
service
.
this
be
such
a
sensitive
issue
that
one
do
not
wish
to
be
political
or
partisan
about
it
but
we
be
not
see
a
improvement
in
the
waiting
list
,
year
on
year
.
what
the
report
of
the
Mental
Health
Commission
show
we
be
illustrative
,
but
it
probably
just
crystallise
we
experience
,
as
public
representative
,
of
mental
health
service
.
it
do
not
tell
we
anything
we
do
not
already
know
.
many
of
we
have
be
experience
the
CAMHS
phenomenon
for
many
year
.
I
be
provide
with
figure
for
wait
list
on
16
September
2022
.
the
information
be
separate
into
people
who
have
be
wait
for
a
appointment
for
less
than
12
week
,
between
12
and
26
week
,
between
26
and
39
week
,
between
39
and
52
week
and
more
than
52
week
.
the
total
be
4,127
.
the
figure
as
of
25
January
be
4293
.
the
number
on
waiting
list
be
increase
.
I
take
the
point
the
Minister
of
State
make
that
there
have
be
a
massive
increase
in
the
demand
for
service
and
that
the
number
of
appointment
stand
at
approximately
250000
.
however
,
we
be
not
keep
ahead
of
the
game
and
ensure
that
people
can
get
through
the
front
door
,
in
the
first
instance
.
it
have
be
all
of
we
experience
that
once
people
get
in
through
the
front
door
,
service
start
to
wrap
around
they
.
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
have
we
spend
€
15
million
on
recruitment
agency
?
that
money
have
be
spend
by
the
HSE
on
recruitment
agency
to
recruit
for
post
that
be
vacant
.
the
Minister
of
State
should
intervene
.
taxpayer
be
not
get
a
return
on
they
investment
via
the
HSE
.
we
be
spend
€
15
million
on
recruitment
agency
to
recruit
for
the
HSE
to
fill
the
post
that
need
to
be
fill
in
the
area
we
be
talk
about
.
that
need
to
be
look
at
.
we
must
ask
where
be
the
value
for
money
and
the
return
on
that
investment
for
the
taxpayer
.
why
be
this
post
not
be
fill
?
we
stand
in
this
Chamber
,
week
in
and
week
out
,
and
talk
about
the
recruitment
crisis
.
be
there
a
way
to
level
the
playing
field
between
cho
?
where
there
be
some
capacity
in
one
cho
,
can
it
be
transfer
to
another
cho
where
there
be
a
acute
level
of
need
?
that
could
be
do
as
we
compare
and
contrast
service
.
we
have
all
now
move
online
.
God
forbid
,
but
if
I
be
look
for
a
intervention
tomorrow
and
the
service
I
require
be
in
Sligo
,
I
could
have
a
online
intervention
.
the
tool
of
the
trade
be
there
to
make
that
happen
.
in
the
interim
,
I
be
ask
that
we
make
service
available
to
people
.
even
if
they
be
make
available
as
online
resource
or
tool
to
begin
with
,
it
would
be
a
start
to
ensure
we
level
the
playing
field
for
the
people
I
represent
in
the
Cork
-
Kerry
region
,
which
have
already
be
the
subject
of
much
controversy
.
we
do
not
want
any
more
.
I

deputy
Buckley

I

the

's
interest

this

before

be

community
.
there
be
no
testimony
more
compelling
than
that
of
deputy
Boyd
Barrett
today
because
that
be
a
first
-
hand
account
.
if
that
do
not
impact
on
all
of
we
,
and
particularly
on
the
government
,
then
we
be
in
cold
time
as
regards
the
promulgation
of
this
legislation
.
I
put
forward
this
amendment
on
committee
stage
because
like
other
,
we
in
the
Opposition
feel
so
constrain
in
seek
to
amend
legislation
.
the
only
tool
we
have
in
we
toolkit
so
as
to
avoid
a
charge
on
the
Exchequer
be
to
put
down
this
amendment
and
seek
to
have
they
repeat
from
committee
to
report
stage
.
this
amendment
be
proportionate
.
the
minister
will
say
it
be
not
but
I
would
argue
with
he
that
it
be
because
this
scheme
be
vast
in
its
undertaking
and
give
the
number
of
people
who
would
be
potentially
omit
from
it
,
we
believe
that
at
the
very
minimum
this
amendment
deserve
to
be
pass
.
all
it
call
for
be
a
report
into
"
whether
and
to
what
extent
person
engage
in
the
management
,
administration
or
operation
of
relevant
institution
should
be
permit
or
require
to
contribute
to
the
cost
of
make
payment
under
this
act
"
.
I
do
not
see
how
that
be
disproportionate
.
it
seem
reasonable
to
I
.
second
,
the
report
would
examine
"
whether
the
180
day
residence
requirement
provide
for
in
section
13
(
1
)
and
(
4
)
should
be
amend
or
repeal
"
.
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
look
back
at
a
section
of
legislation
that
have
be
pass
to
ask
whether
it
be
fit
for
purpose
and
whether
it
should
be
review
.
third
,
the
report
would
look
into
"
whether
the
scheme
should
be
extend
so
as
to
make
provision
for
recognise
person
who
be
board
out
as
child
as
relevant
person
"
.
when
I
put
forward
my
amendment
,
which
I
be
happy
to
share
with
colleague
,
the
minister
address
the
issue
of
the
180
day
on
Committee
stage
.
he
say
:
absence
of
up
to
180
day
will
not
disqualify
somebody
from
make
a
claim
.
the
reason
for
that
be
that
we
know
there
be
people
who
,
because
of
what
happen
in
the
institution
,
the
ill
health
they
suffer
,
the
poor
condition
or
the
poor
treatment
,
spend
large
amount
of
time
not
in
the
home
but
in
hospital
,
often
return
to
the
home
...
we
just
want
that
people
to
be
include
.
we
want
any
report
into
or
review
of
the
scheme
to
ensure
that
people
be
include
so
they
be
not
exclude
forever
or
so
the
next
generation
of
politician
be
not
revisit
this
in
20
or
30
year
'
time
.
if
the
lesson
of
the
last
week
or
two
be
anything
to
go
by
,
we
will
be
revisit
this
,
mark
my
word
,
as
sure
as
night
follow
day
.
the
people
who
be
aged
from
zero
to
six
month
will
wish
for
this
to
be
revisit
somewhere
down
the
line
.
I
have
no
doubt
about
that
.
the
evidence
of
the
correspondence
we
have
receive
should
be
enough
to
jolt
any
government
into
action
in
respect
of
that
cohort
of
people
who
need
for
this
to
be
deal
with
,
now
and
in
a
contemporary
way
-
not
down
the
line
but
now
.
that
be
the
hallmark
of
fairness
,
for
it
to
be
deal
with
in
the
here
and
now
.
in
the
amendment
,
we
be
look
specifically
for
a
report
into
whether
the
duration
of
the
scheme
should
be
extend
.
that
be
not
unreasonable
.
we
be
very
conscious
when
we
be
put
forward
the
wording
of
this
amendment
that
we
would
seek
to
be
reasonable
in
we
approach
.
we
do
not
want
to
be
rhetorical
but
ask
the
minister
in
the
hope
he
would
see
that
nothing
we
be
request
here
be
unreasonable
or
disproportionate
.
that
be
why
we
find
ourselves
here
today
on
report
stage
,
because
we
fail
on
Committee
Stage
to
have
that
measure
put
into
the
legislation
and
we
be
now
ask
again
.
we
be
come
back
to
the
table
to
ask
that
that
people
be
look
after
.
look
at
the
minister
's
response
in
respect
of
section
42
of
the
Act
,
he
again
state
:
the
intention
of
section
42
be
for
two
review
to
be
conduct
on
the
scheme
.
one
be
a
interim
review
to
be
commence
two
year
after
the
establishment
day
while
the
other
be
to
be
commence
after
the
completion
of
the
scheme
.
section
42
set
out
a
list
of
matter
that
should
be
consider
as
part
of
this
review
and
allow
for
the
minister
to
specify
any
additional
matter
.
the
minister
have
the
power
to
specify
any
additional
matter
.
furthermore
,
he
state
,
"
section
12
provide
that
the
chief
decide
officer
shall
prepare
a
annual
report
on
the
performance
of
he
or
she
function
and
that
each
annual
report
will
be
lay
before
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
"
we
be
put
much
store
in
what
the
chief
decide
officer
will
determine
.
the
minister
can
"
specify
any
additional
matter
.
"
that
be
the
minister
's
word
when
he
speak
on
Committee
stage
.
I
be
sure
he
will
repeat
that
word
at
report
Stage
.
all
we
be
ask
be
for
the
report
on
the
operation
of
the
scheme
to
include
the
subsection
we
have
set
out
in
amendment
no.
2
.
that
be
not
a
unreasonable
request
.
I
say
this
in
a
absolutely
non-partisan
way
and
in
the
spirit
and
tone
of
be
very
conscious
about
the
impact
of
this
issue
on
society
.
there
be
a
psychological
scar
on
society
because
of
this
issue
and
the
attempt
by
this
generation
of
politician
who
have
this
mandate
now
to
try
to
improve
the
scheme
in
a
way
that
ensure
we
will
not
be
revisit
this
at
some
future
date
.
to
be
fair
,
one
could
have
anticipate
the
minister
's
response
because
it
be
consistent
with
the
response
on
committee
stage
.
I
be
hopeful
there
would
be
some
movement
by
the
minister
in
respect
of
what
we
be
seek
to
do
in
amendment
no.
2
.
I
share
the
view
of
deputy
Cairn
in
respect
of
the
culture
that
seemingly
exist
within
the
Department
in
respect
of
the
freedom
of
information
request
that
be
put
in
by
Elaine
Loughlin
and
Conall
Ó
Fátharta
,
as
report
in
yesterday
's
Irish
Examiner
,
which
report
:
"
premature
release
of
policy
deliberation
into
the
public
domain
carry
significant
risk
to
policy
decision
-
making
process
,
particularly
in
area
that
be
highly
contentious
.
"
do
not
infantilise
people
who
have
a
voice
themselves
.
do
not
refer
to
they
as
a
"
vulnerable
group
"
.
this
be
people
who
be
well
able
to
stand
up
for
themselves
.
do
not
condescend
to
they
.
do
not
patronise
they
.
meet
they
as
equal
.
we
know
that
the
scheme
be
flawed
because
we
know
there
be
so
many
who
be
exclude
because
of
this
legislation
.
we
know
that
quite
a
number
of
people
will
not
have
access
to
healthcare
.
all
we
be
seek
,
in
what
we
feel
be
a
very
reasonable
way
,
be
that
the
minister
shift
a
little
bit
towards
the
position
the
Opposition
be
promulgate
.
within
the
very
limited
means
we
have
,
we
want
to
at
least
keep
on
the
agenda
the
very
people
we
be
seek
to
represent
,
namely
,
that
who
be
board
out
,
people
who
be
bear
in
mother
and
baby
home
,
and
the
people
who
be
in
birth
to
six
month
age
category
.
I
have
a
daughter
at
home
who
be
six
month
old
.
any
of
we
who
have
child
see
the
importance
of
the
first
six
month
in
any
child
's
life
and
the
importance
of
the
interaction
between
the
parent
and
child
.
for
the
life
of
I
,
I
do
not
see
how
,
logically
,
we
can
exclude
people
in
that
category
.
the
logic
of
the
position
be
take
by
the
minister
be
down
to
finance
and
how
much
money
will
be
spend
on
the
scheme
.
so
many
people
be
be
exclude
,
which
be
not
fair
.
on
that
basis
,
we
will
press
the
amendment
and
seek
to
vote
on
it
.
I
propose
this
amendment
and
there
be
five
second
leave
in
the
slot
.
the
idea
that
people
cannot
institute
civil
proceedings
if
they
receive
a
payment
be
something
that
will
be
revisit
in
law
.
this
will
come
back
to
haunt
we
.
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
.
I
raise
the
issue
of
the
role
of
chief
decide
officer
on
Committee
stage
.
there
be
still
no
clarity
as
to
the
status
of
that
role
.
will
it
be
a
Civil
service
role
?
will
it
be
subject
to
the
Public
appointment
service
process
?
what
grade
will
the
appoint
person
be
?
be
there
a
equivalent
grade
within
the
Civil
Service
in
respect
of
that
role
?
what
role
will
public
representative
have
?
I
draw
similarity
between
when
I
make
representation
to
the
HSE
or
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
there
be
any
number
of
officer
with
whom
I
deal
with
depend
on
the
issue
and
there
be
a
hierarchy
there
.
first
,
we
need
to
be
able
to
make
representation
,
on
behalf
of
we
constituent
,
to
the
decide
officer
or
a
designate
person
.
second
,
what
be
the
infrastructure
around
that
person
?
what
we
do
not
want
be
a
situation
in
which
we
be
seek
to
advocate
on
behalf
of
people
in
a
reasonable
fashion
but
we
be
disbarr
from
do
so
.
I
need
to
know
,
in
simple
term
,
whether
I
can
make
representation
on
behalf
of
my
constituent
who
present
to
I
regard
they
interaction
with
the
office
that
be
to
be
set
up
?

I
ask
the
Minister
for
social
Protection
whether
income
disregard
could
be
review
for
the
purpose
of
assessment
of
means
for
carer
's
allowance
with
a
view
to
ensure
the
income
of
spouse
,
civil
partner
or
cohabitant
,
where
they
work
overtime
,
will
not
disbar
a
applicant
from
eligibility
for
carer
's
allowance
.
the
minister
will
be
aware
of
the
specific
case
to
which
I
refer
,
even
though
I
have
anonymise
the
detail
.
I
welcome
the
fact
the
minister
will
carry
out
a
review
.
I
take
she
at
she
word
in
that
regard
.
I
acknowledge
the
fact
the
government
have
increase
the
income
disregard
from
€
665
to
€
750
for
a
couple
.
the
scenario
I
be
talk
about
involve
a
couple
where
there
be
two
parent
,
one
of
whom
be
work
while
the
second
forgo
a
career
to
care
for
a
son
or
daughter
and
also
forgo
a
lot
of
opportunity
,
and
do
so
absolutely
willingly
.
the
person
then
find
that
because
they
be
lock
out
of
the
system
and
because
of
a
increase
in
income
due
to
overtime
,
all
other
benefit
accrue
to
the
family
be
lose
.
it
be
that
small
exception
in
scheme
that
we
be
speak
to
here
.
a
small
number
of
couple
throughout
the
country
be
affect
by
this
.
it
be
to
be
hope
they
will
be
include
in
any
review
that
the
minister
undertake
.
the
incremental
,
but
substantial
,
improvement
make
under
the
minister
's
mandate
be
acknowledge
.
the
scenario
I
be
talk
about
be
where
a
spouse
have
to
work
all
of
the
hour
God
give
they
to
bring
income
into
a
family
while
they
spouse
be
care
for
a
person
,
but
all
of
a
sudden
the
income
be
gone
.
it
put
tremendous
pressure
on
the
family
.
if
something
could
be
do
in
respect
of
the
income
disregard
I
would
welcome
that
.
I
would
be
happy
to
furnish
the
minister
with
further
detail
of
this
particular
family
's
circumstance
in
the
context
of
the
review
she
will
carry
out
,
with
a
view
to
she
potentially
consider
that
family
's
scenario
.
I
be
sure
it
be
typical
of
many
scenario
throughout
the
country
.
the
minister
be
in
government
.
I
thank
a
Cathaoirleach
Gníomhach
for
let
I
in
.
I
have
two
simple
question
.
could
that
potentially
apply
to
somebody
who
be
care
for
somebody
for
a
period
and
be
eligible
for
carer
's
allowance
,
for
example
,
where
a
person
have
a
intellectual
disability
in
the
first
instance
and
second
,
where
a
domiciliary
care
allowance
might
have
apply
in
the
lifetime
of
a
carer
?
will
the
minister
outline
in
tabular
form
the
number
of
application
receive
in
2022
for
disability
allowance
,
domiciliary
care
allowance
and
carer
's
allowance
,
the
number
that
be
award
,
and
the
number
of
application
under
appeal
?
I
will
not
have
sight
of
that
as
we
be
here
,
but
I
will
have
sight
of
that
in
the
reply
late
on
.
I
welcome
the
comprehensive
set
of
figure
there
,
but
it
be
glaring
that
across
disability
allowance
,
domiciliary
care
allowance
,
and
carer
's
allowance
application
,
there
be
approximately
5000
appeal
for
disability
allowance
,
2000
appeal
for
domiciliary
care
allowance
,
and
3500
for
carer
's
allowance
.
I
have
pose
the
question
because
if
there
be
a
way
of
further
streamline
the
process
,
particularly
for
parent
where
application
be
make
for
domiciliary
care
allowance
,
this
would
be
very
helpful
.
this
be
on
the
basis
that
the
weight
of
medical
evidence
that
must
be
supply
be
burdensome
.
person
understand
they
have
to
do
it
,
and
obviously
we
must
have
check
and
balance
to
ensure
the
scheme
deliver
what
it
be
suppose
to
deliver
.
nobody
argue
against
that
.
however
,
when
a
decision
be
make
by
a
Department
's
decide
medical
officer
,
very
often
it
pose
question
as
to
the
legitimacy
of
that
decision
.
give
the
weight
of
the
medical
evidence
that
have
be
submit
,
people
feel
understandably
annoyed
where
they
initial
application
be
turn
down
and
,
in
many
case
,
the
decision
be
overturn
on
appeal
.
there
be
still
quite
a
number
that
do
not
reach
oral
hearing
level
.
with
the
domiciliary
care
allowance
in
particular
,
the
fact
that
2000
application
have
go
to
appeal
have
to
tell
we
something
about
the
system
and
whether
it
be
work
.
what
we
have
be
a
situation
where
one
consultant
or
medical
professional
be
overturn
the
decision
of
another
.
this
,
effectively
,
be
what
be
happen
when
the
medical
examiner
look
at
the
case
.
for
example
,
I
go
to
my
consultant
who
know
I
,
have
a
relationship
with
I
and
completely
understand
the
nature
of
my
complaint
.
that
could
then
be
overturn
by
somebody
who
never
meet
the
applicant
,
who
never
interact
with
the
applicant
and
who
be
make
a
decision
against
the
applicant
.
it
have
always
be
thus
,
and
maybe
it
be
time
for
we
,
give
that
the
minister
be
reform
in
nature
,
perhaps
to
look
at
this
again
.
there
be
three
very
particular
scheme
for
which
thousand
of
people
make
application
where
decision
be
make
on
medical
grounds
on
the
basis
of
what
be
arguably
a
desktop
exercise
.
if
the
minister
see
fit
to
look
at
that
again
and
perhaps
review
it
,
that
would
be
very
helpful
.

please
proceed
.
I
remind
colleague
that
this
business
must
conclude
at
6.09
p.m
.
there
be
three
speaker
offer
.
I
call
deputy
McNamara
.
I
support
the
motion
.
the
Labour
Party
have
be
lead
the
way
regard
what
we
perceive
to
be
the
reduction
or
diminution
in
community
welfare
officer
service
at
the
most
local
level
for
a
long
time
now
.
while
many
people
will
easily
interact
with
a
freephone
number
and
that
will
capture
perhaps
a
new
audience
,
many
vulnerable
people
live
in
rural
area
will
not
have
the
wherewithal
to
go
to
local
Intreo
office
.
I
continue
to
make
this
case
to
the
minister
and
ask
that
this
be
look
at
again
.
we
need
to
bring
the
service
to
as
many
people
as
possible
.
we
have
all
quote
countless
example
to
she
of
what
we
perceive
to
be
a
creep
centralisation
of
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
.
that
scheme
be
enshrine
in
legislation
for
a
reason
,
which
be
that
it
would
allow
for
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
local
community
welfare
officer
.
we
feel
there
be
a
departmental
policy
now
to
try
to
squeeze
that
as
much
as
possible
.
the
minister
will
say
a
increase
of
approximately
€
17
million
have
be
pay
out
in
additional
need
.
I
be
never
aware
of
such
a
specific
scheme
set
out
in
statute
call
a
additional
need
scheme
.
I
always
understand
it
to
be
a
exceptional
need
payment
and
urgent
need
payment
scheme
.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
additional
€
17
million
have
be
pay
out
,
which
be
acknowledge
,
the
number
of
recipient
have
go
up
to
97000
.
I
believe
strongly
that
be
a
suppress
demand
.
what
I
mean
by
this
be
that
if
more
people
know
the
service
exist
,
they
would
come
in
to
avail
of
it
.
many
people
still
do
not
know
the
service
exist
.
we
have
evidence
that
where
people
have
try
to
engage
with
the
service
,
they
have
find
it
to
be
cumbersome
and
overly
bureaucratic
.
that
have
be
the
experience
in
my
constituency
office
.
that
should
be
make
simple
and
more
seamless
.
the
minister
will
say
that
people
have
the
right
to
be
visit
in
they
home
and
the
right
to
engage
on
a
face
-
to
-
face
level
.
if
there
be
more
of
that
in
the
community
at
the
most
rural
and
local
level
,
and
not
necessarily
house
in
or
funnel
through
the
Intreo
office
,
that
would
capture
many
more
people
in
dire
need
at
the
moment
.
I
speak
not
just
specifically
for
the
people
who
would
have
be
recipient
on
a
repeat
basis
for
such
payment
but
the
new
working
poor
who
be
on
fix
income
and
whose
mortgage
and
fuel
cost
have
increase
.
while
they
be
on
fix
income
,
they
be
not
able
to
meet
the
additional
need
in
a
house
and
additional
expense
that
arise
.
I
ask
the
minister
and
government
to
take
this
into
account
when
be
consider
any
proposal
.
the
word
"
wean
"
have
be
use
in
government
circle
.
the
government
be
talk
about
wean
people
off
cost
-
of
-
living
measure
in
the
come
week
.
I
ask
the
minister
to
examine
the
evidence
base
in
the
government
's
own
figure
,
which
be
supply
to
I
in
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
and
show
that
97000
applicant
avail
of
more
than
€
58.2
million
in
additional
or
exceptional
need
payment
.
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
be
the
jewel
in
the
crown
that
ensure
people
do
not
fall
below
a
certain
floor
and
that
protection
be
in
place
for
the
most
vulnerable
when
they
be
need
.
thank
goodness
we
live
in
this
State
and
that
we
provide
this
when
we
consider
other
example
around
the
world
where
there
be
no
such
support
.
I
believe
strongly
,
though
,
that
we
have
to
consider
the
evidence
that
be
come
forward
to
we
from
ngo
and
voluntary
body
.
again
,
the
evidence
be
come
from
this
house
through
testimonial
by
individual
deputy
who
report
back
to
the
minister
on
case
with
which
we
be
deal
.
we
need
to
ensure
there
be
a
protection
of
basic
social
welfare
payment
.
there
be
definitely
a
need
to
ensure
there
be
a
increase
to
meet
the
additional
cost
-
of
-
living
increase
.
if
we
think
about
the
fact
that
in
2022
,
€
5.7
million
be
spend
on
clothing
,
€
6.6
million
on
funeral
cost
,
€
1.8
million
on
household
bill
and
more
than
€
7.5
million
on
general
expense
under
this
scheme
,
base
on
the
criterion
for
pay
somebody
,
there
be
a
clear
evidence
base
there
that
that
scheme
be
vital
and
necessary
.
they
need
to
continue
and
they
can
not
be
cut
back
.
this
argument
of
wean
people
off
be
a
very
unfortunate
use
of
language
by
government
.
it
be
very
right
wing
and
it
demean
people
.
this
be
work
people
in
the
main
who
need
this
payment
because
they
be
on
fix
income
.
I
be
not
direct
this
at
the
minister
.
let
I
be
very
clear
about
that
.
this
idea
of
taper
down
payment
at
a
time
when
there
be
clearly
a
cost
-
of
-
living
crisis
have
be
use
in
other
government
circle
,
however
.
the
evidence
from
the
minister
's
own
figure
,
as
supply
to
we
in
reply
to
parliamentary
question
,
be
that
there
be
a
clear
need
for
this
supplementary
welfare
allowance
payment
.
there
be
a
very
clear
evidence
base
for
they
to
continue
.
I
would
hope
that
they
will
continue
and
that
there
will
be
no
effort
to
wean
people
off
.
I
will
return
to
what
I
perceive
to
be
the
creep
centralisation
of
service
within
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
I
be
not
ask
for
the
wheel
to
be
reinvent
.
I
be
merely
ask
that
the
minister
go
back
to
the
well
.
the
well
spring
be
always
a
department
that
go
out
to
the
people
to
provide
the
service
to
they
.
it
form
relationship
with
people
on
the
ground
.
community
welfare
officer
know
the
person
with
whom
they
be
deal
.
they
know
they
context
and
be
able
to
make
decision
in
a
very
quick
time
.
if
,
for
instance
,
I
be
advocate
to
a
community
welfare
officer
on
behalf
of
a
constituent
,
we
have
that
relationship
.
thankfully
,
in
some
part
of
my
constituency
,
we
still
have
that
relationship
,
and
I
be
very
grateful
for
it
.
we
have
excellent
community
welfare
officer
.
if
,
for
instance
,
a
piece
of
documentation
or
evidence
be
missing
that
would
meet
the
criterion
to
pay
somebody
,
that
could
be
easily
sort
.
the
person
could
be
put
into
payment
quickly
and
then
come
back
the
next
day
with
the
document
and
everything
would
be
sort
.
now
,
there
be
too
many
hurdle
for
the
individual
applicant
to
cross
because
the
relationship
between
the
applicant
and
the
system
have
become
disjointed
in
a
way
that
the
person
to
whom
the
application
be
make
do
not
have
that
direct
relationship
.
we
need
to
go
back
to
that
.
that
should
be
a
easy
thing
to
do
and
resurrect
.
it
be
on
that
basis
that
we
support
the
motion
.
however
,
we
will
continue
to
lobby
for
a
proper
fit
-
for
-
purpose
community
welfare
officer
system
and
supplementary
welfare
allowance
system
that
do
not
take
the
service
away
in
a
qualitative
sense
from
the
client
.
this
be
a
customer
-
face
Department
and
it
must
continue
to
be
one
.
I
hear
the
deputy
loud
and
clear
.
he
want
St.
Fergal
's
College
,
Rathdowney
,
to
be
provide
with
a
PE
hall
in
the
interest
of
equity
and
he
want
I
to
take
that
message
back
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Foley
.
I
will
do
that
.
the
current
situation
be
that
the
exist
additional
school
accommodation
scheme
do
not
include
provision
for
PE
hall
and
yet
the
national
development
plan
be
a
more
than
€
100
billion
capital
scheme
.
in
future
iteration
of
the
plan
,
or
future
scheme
develop
for
the
Department
of
Education
,
consideration
will
be
make
to
include
PE
hall
.
not
just
that
,
that
they
will
include
a
PE
hall
build
and
modernisation
programme
to
ensure
student
in
all
post
-
primary
school
will
have
access
to
appropriate
facility
in
order
to
support
PE
provision
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
roll
-
out
of
PE
as
a
leave
certificate
subject
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
that
if
we
be
go
to
have
PE
as
a
leave
certificate
subject
,
the
question
arise
as
to
how
it
can
be
do
without
have
a
PE
hall
in
place
;
that
there
be
a
need
for
a
PE
hall
in
a
country
that
be
not
always
dry
in
order
that
student
can
participate
in
sport
indoors
;
that
have
healthy
student
be
part
of
the
preventive
health
and
public
health
programme
for
the
country
;
and
that
it
save
we
money
in
the
long
term
if
student
be
get
they
physical
education
in
school
.
this
apply
to
everybody
,
not
just
that
student
who
be
sporty
and
able
to
catch
a
ball
.
plenty
of
sport
can
be
do
indoors
-
the
kind
of
one
that
I
do
-
and
be
good
for
general
health
rather
than
that
that
be
overly
competitive
or
which
can
be
do
outside
in
a
field
.
I
see
where
the
deputy
be
come
from
and
I
will
take
he
comment
back

and

what
he
have

with
a
PE
hall
in
the
interest
of
equity
and
he
want
I
to
take
that
message
back
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Foley
.
I
will
do
that
.
the
current
situation
be
that
the
exist
additional
school
accommodation
scheme
do
not
include
provision
for
PE
hall
and
yet
the
national
development
plan
be
a
more
than
€
100
billion
capital
scheme
.
in
future
iteration
of
the
plan
,
or
future
scheme
develop
for
the
Department
of
Education
,
consideration
will
be
make
to
include
PE
hall
.
not
just
that
,
that
they
will
include
a
PE
hall
build
and
modernisation
programme
to
ensure
student
in
all
post
-
primary
school
will
have
access
to
appropriate
facility
in
order
to
support
PE
provision
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
roll
-
out
of
PE
as
a
leave
certificate
subject
.
I
take
the
deputy
's
point
that
if
we
be
go
to
have
PE
as
a
leave
certificate
subject
,
the
question
arise
as
to
how
it
can
be
do
without
have
a
PE
hall
in
place
;
that
there
be
a
need
for
a
PE
hall
in
a
country
that
be
not
always
dry
in
order
that
student
can
participate
in
sport
indoors
;
that
have
healthy
student
be
part
of
the
preventive
health
and
public
health
programme
for
the
country
;
and
that
it
save
we
money
in
the
long
term
if
student
be
get
they
physical
education
in
school
.
this
apply
to
everybody
,
not
just
that
student
who
be
sporty
and
able
to
catch
a
ball
.
plenty
of
sport
can
be
do
indoors
-
the
kind
of
one
that
I
do
-
and
be
good
for
general
health
rather
than
that
that
be
overly
competitive
or
which
can
be
do
outside
in
a
field
.
I
see
where
the
deputy
be
come
from
and
I
will
take
he
comment
back
to
the
minister
and
tell
she
what
he
have
say
today
.
the
minister
have
previously
address
this
but
I
want
to
raise
again
the
issue
of
access
to
ophthalmology
service
in
the
CHO
4
region
,
which
cover
County
Kerry
,
north
Cork
,
north
Lee
,
south
Lee
and
west
Cork
,
which
be
present
challenge
.
more
than
€
200000
have
be
spend
on
private
provider
in
this
area
in
the
past
while
and
more
than
3000
child
be
still
wait
for
ophthalmology
intervention
in
the
area
.
it
appear
that
recruitment
continue
to
be
a
significant
issue
.
on
2
December
2022
I
receive
correspondence
from
the
South
/
SouthWest
Hospital
Group
on
foot
of
representation
I
make
by
way
of
a
parliamentary
question
,
where
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Health
,
deputy
Stephen
Donnelly
,
the
number
of
staff
,
the
grade
and
the
length
of
service
of
each
member
currently
assign
to
ophthalmology
service
across
Cork
hospital
and
the
number
of
vacancy
in
the
same
hospital
.
I
be
tell
that
there
be
approximately
39
whole
-
time
equivalent
in
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
but
that
the
number
of
vacancy
for
whole
-
time
equivalent
be
two
.
for
South
Infirmary
Victoria
University
Hospital
,
SIVUH
,
it
be
25
with
a
vacancy
rate
there
of
2.7
whole
-
time
equivalent
while
in
the
Mercy
University
Hospital
,
MUH
,
the
number
that
come
back
be
zero
.
the
minister
tell
I
that
the
South
/
SouthWest
Hospital
Group
have
advise
that
it
"
expect
the
new
operating
theatre
will
be
open
in
March
2023
"
.
will
the
€
5
million
ophthalmology
unit
will
become
operational
in
March
,
as
have
be
articulate
in
the
past
?
what
comfort
can
the
minister
of
State
give
to
that
people
who
be
seek
to
access
public
service
now
that
the
require
number
of
vacancy
will
be
fill
?
I
fully
appreciate
that
the
HSE
will
spend
considerable
amount
of
taxpayer
's
money
on
waiting
list
initiative
but
the
cost
to
the
Exchequer
of
wait
list
initiative
be
increase
dramatically
.
in
November
2021
,
39
patient
be
refer
to
one
of
this
list
at
a
cost
of
€
15000
while
in
June
last
year
,
559
patient
be
refer
to
a
private
company
at
a
cost
of
€
83000
.
if
we
want
to
get
people
through
the
list
,
that
be
fine
and
I
do
not
think
anybody
have
any
issue
with
that
but
be
not
good
value
for
money
when
we
have
a
unit
cost
€
5
million
that
be
suppose
to
be
for
public
service
sit
there
and
there
be
still
recruitment
issue
into
the
public
service
.
we
do
not
want
to
see
a
continuation
of
a
wait
list
initiative
by
private
provider
when
it
can
be
do
through
the
public
realm
.
it
all
boil
down
to
the
3022
child
wait
for
ophthalmology
intervention
I
represent
.
that
be
a
significant
number
.
I
seek
comfort
from
the
Minister
of
State
that
what
the
taxpayer
have
invest
in
will
become
operational
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
send
a
message
back
to
the
machine
and
the
system
.
I
appreciate
that
.
I
also
appreciate
the
fact
that
she
be
take
this
issue
on
behalf
of
the
minister
and
answer
be
not
always
readily
provide
to
she
.
I
take
some
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
building
in
Ballincollig
be
operational
and
ready
for
equip
to
deliver
the
integrate
eye
care
service
.
that
give
I
grounds
for
some
hope
.
however
,
there
seem
to
be
a
juxtaposition
in
the
reply
because
the
Minister
of
State
's
next
sentence
mention
that
the
integrate
eye
care
service
"
await
funding
approval
from
the
HSE
"
.
she
also
say
the
stakeholder
be
meet
tomorrow
.
I
be
not
direct
this
at
she
per
se
but
in
she
reply
,
she
say
the
building
in
Ballincollig
be
operational
and
ready
for
equip
.
I
need
to
know
if
it
be
go
to
be
fully
fund
.
the
ophthalmology
unit
base
in
SIVUH
,
which
cost
€
5
million
,
be
not
operational
.
I
need
some
comfort
for
the
people
I
represent
in
the
CHO
4
area
in
order
that
I
can
assure
they
there
will
be
seamless
access
to
service
,
whether
on
a
community
basis
or
at
consultant
level
.
the
Minister
of
State
make
reference
to
the
involvement
of
community
.
there
be
great
scope
for
community
optician
to
become
involved
in
all
of
this
but
what
they
be
tell
I
be
that
the
€
23
they
get
per
medical
card
patient
be
not
worth
they
while
,
give
the
associate
administrative
burden
.
some
people
be
leave
the
system
.
if
we
be
talk
about
a
front
-
door
system
,
where
the
front
door
be
a
gp
or
community
optician
,
we
must
make
it
financially
viable
for
community
optician
to
be
able
to
deliver
more
.
they
cannot
do
that
at
€
23
per
patient
because
it
do
not
reflect
the
cost
of
provide
the
service
.
the
Taoiseach
be
depart
from
he
usual
practice
.
it
be
a
mini-budget
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
debate
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
piece
of
work
identify
in
the
White
Paper
on
defence
to
provide
more
modern
aggregate
legislation
.
Sinn
Féin
support
the
Bill

the

while
the

do
not
propose
any
radical
change

the
operation
of
the
Civil
Defence
,
we
welcome
the
move
to

what
be
a
convoluted
regulatory
framework
consist
of
enactment
from
as
far
back
as
1939
to
one

clearly

I
thank
the
chairman
for
allow
I
the
opportunity
to
speak
at
the
committee
.
I
will
address
my
question
specifically
to
Mr.
McAuley
.
there
be
much
talk
of
the
Mackinnon
report
during
the
deliberation
on
the
forestry
Bill
.
we
do
not
get
very
far
on
Committee
Stage
of
that
Bill
.
certainly
it
be
the
intention
of
some
of
we
to
speak
more
comprehensively
to
the
22
recommendation
of
the
report
in
the
amendment
we
have
tab
to
the
Bill
but
,
unfortunately
,
that
do
not
happen
.
I
be
worried
about
what
Mr.
McAuley
say
about
the
invitation
he
receive
to
come
before
the
Department
as
part
of
a
stakeholder
group
.
if
I
understand
he
correctly
,
he
say
he
be
not
sure
if
there
would
be
a
focus
on
the
Mackinnon
report
.
as
deputy
Fitzmaurice
say
,
I
tab
a
parliamentary
question
some
week
ago
in
respect
of
the
chair
of
the
implementation
group
of
the
recommendation
of
that
report
.
many
of
we
put
much
stock
on
that
report
and
its
recommendation
as
a
way
forward
whereby
all
stakeholder
could
move
with
both
State
interest
and
stakehold
interest
.
be
it
Mr.
McAuley
's
impression
it
be
the
intention
of
the
Department
to
lessen
the
impact
of
that
report
in
some
way
or
not
give
it
its
due
regard
?
I
do
not
wish
to
put
word
in
he
mouth
and
forgive
I
if
I
have
misinterpret
he
but
be
it
he
view
that
the
report
have
end
up
on
a
shelf
and
will
gather
dust
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
it
would
worry
I
considerably
because
I
would
have
think
many
forestry
stakeholder
would
have
actively
participate
in
that
process
and
that
it
would
have
provide
a
template
to
move
forward
and
progress
matter
we
be
discuss
here
today
.
I
thank
the
three
witness
,
Mr.
McAuley
,
Mr.
O'Brien
and
Mr.
Gowran
,
for
attend
today
.
we
have
have
a
very
good
exchange
of
view
.
I
thank
they
for
get
use
to
the
technology
for
the
meeting
.
this
be
the
first
successful
zoom
meeting
we
have
have
.
I
also
thank
the
staff
for
get
the
meeting
up
and
run
.
we
have
a
false
start
on
the
last
occasion
but
it
have
run
very
smoothly
today
.
I
thank
the
staff
and
the
witness
for
they
co-operation
.
I
propose
we
now
go
into
private
session
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
I
thank
the
chair
.
I
appreciate
he
facilitate
I
and
I
will
be
brief
.
the
rate
of
afforestation
in
the
county
of
Cork
have
go
from
a
high
of
14
%
per
annum
down
to
somewhere
around
4
%
.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
Coillte
,
perhaps
not
now
but
in
writing
,
how
it
will
address
that
massive
decline
.
Munster
be
see
a
collapse
in
planting
,
relative
to
other
part
of
the
country
.
I
would
be
grateful
to
receive
correspondence
in
respect
of
the
corporate
strategy
to
address
that
issue
.
on
a
similar
vein
,
we
be
now
see
the
increase
use
by
citizen
of
Coillte
estate
for
leisure
purpose
.
Covid
have
highlight
the
importance
of
forestry
.
to
be
fair
to
Coillte
,
it
have
do
a
tremendous
job
in
term
of
open
up
its
estate
and
make
they
as
user
-
friendly
as
possible
.
if
we
be
talk
about
afforestation
and
move
away
from
sitka
spruce
,
it
would
be
greatly
welcome
if
there
be
a
strategy
and
policy
for
area
,
such
as
that
in
my
own
area
in
north
Cork
,
include
Rahan
,
the
Ballyhouras
,
the
Nagles
and
the
Knockarowra
mountain
outside
of
Mallow
,
where
we
be
see
piecemeal
improvement
in
term
of
road
infrastructure
,
pathway
infrastructure
and
mix
-
use
forestry
,
so
that
family
can
benefit
and
submerse
themselves
more
in
forestry
from
a
leisure
point
of
view
.
I
thank
the
chair
for
let
I
in
.
I
realise
he
be
under
pressure
of
time
.
I
would
be
delighted
if
somebody
from
Coillte
could
engage
with
I
,
maybe
offline
,
on
this
issue
.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
make
a
intervention
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
and
she
statement
.
I
concur
with
other
speaker
on
the
lack
of
a
reference
to
the
Mackinnon
report
.
however
,
I
acknowledge
the
Minister
of
State
have
hold
up
the
report
and
recommend
we
all
read
it
.
I
have
read
it
,
and
it
make
interesting
finding
and
recommendation
.
the
report
state
that
in
2019
almost
half
the
application
take
more
than
99
day
to
decide
.
it
state
also
that
"
concern
that
bureaucracy
and
regulation
have
take
precedence
over
enable
woodland
expansion
"
,
that
"
strong
concern
be
express
about
the
performance
of
the
Department
and
the
quality
of

"
and
that

kpi
need
to
be
develop
essentially
around
timescale
for
decision
making
"
.
I
welcome
the
fact
the
Minister
of
State
have
put
in
place
a
project
management
board
and
that
16
full
-
time
equivalent
ecologist
and
ten
additional
forestry
inspector
be
appoint
.
that
be
a
move
in
the
right
direction
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
go
to
initiate
the
forestry
policy
group
and
have
hint
that
Ms
Jo
O'Hara
will
be
announce
as
the
person
appoint
to
oversee
the
implementation
of
the
Mackinnon
report
.
will
there
be
a
possibility
for
the
forestry
policy
group
to
interact
with
the
project
management
group
and
the
chair
of
the
implementation
group
in
a
seamless
way
?
this
would
impact
case
such
as
that
highlight
at
today
's
meeting
,
where
there
be
a
undue
length
of
time
or
obstacle
be
put
in
the
way
of
a
seamless
process
.
will
there
be
a
mechanism
to
enable
the
triumvirate
of
Mackinnon
,
the
project
management
board
and
the
forestry
policy
group
to
deal
with
every
issue
that
arise
and
to
put
in
place
a
process
to
take
seriously
the
issue
we
hear
about
today
in
order
that
there
will
be
a
result
?
we
must
be
output
drive
and
must
see
result
.
that
be
the
only
question
I
have
today
.
we
will
see
.
I
thank
the
minister
of
State
,
she
official
and
the
member
of
the
committee
.
we
will
see
.
I
thank
the
minister
of
State
,
she
official
and
the
member
of
the
committee
.
I
welcome
the
submission
make
by
Ms
Webb
.
it
be
base
on
a
rational
approach
to
this
problem
.
the
issue
of
GM
food
and
the
importation
of
grain
and
feedstuff
should
be
base
on
a
rational
,
scientific
approach
.
the
Irish
position
have
fall
victim
to
the
French
position
within
the
EU
Council
on
this
issue
.
at
the
meeting
take
place
today
or
tomorrow
,
it
appear
that
the
French
position
at
the
Council
of
Minister
will
be
vital
to
this
.
I
wonder
to
what
extent
the
Irish
position
have
hitch
its
wagon
to
the
French
caravan
.
if
the
scientific
evidence
clearly
put
forward
by
the
standing
committee
be
one
which
allow
for
ga21
to
be
import
,
I
do
not
see
why
it
should
not
be
bring
forward
.
I
do
not
see
why
Ireland
should
not
take
a
common
-
sense
approach
.
the
question
be
whether
this
committee
have
any
competence
in
influence
the
minister
's
position
.
if
that
be
not
the
case
then
perhaps
we
be
talk
here
in
a
vacuum
.
the
minister
need
to
take
a
very
clear
approach
,
one
way
or
the
other
.
I
would
advocate
that
the
minister
propose
that
this
would
be
import
,
but
also
that
the
timeframe
under
which
the
standing
committee
operate
be
shorten
.
it
be
not
affect
the
competitiveness
of
Irish
agriculture
,
but
it
be
affect
EU
term
of
trade
on
a
global
basis
.
the
Japanese
can
do
it
within
a
12
-
month
timeframe
and
the
FDA
in
the
US
can
also
do
it
much
quick
than
here
.
we
need
to
catch
up
with
the
science
on
this
,
but
the
politics
also
need
to
be
address
.
the
nub
of
the
matter
be
whether
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
will
take
a
strong
position
,
endorse
the
position
the
IGFA
be
advocate
and
,
ultimately
,
whether
she
will
move
to
benefit
Irish
agriculture
.
in
respect
of
the
rationale
,
and
one
always
like
to
take
a
rational
view
of
this
thing
,
we
have
be
genetically
modify
crop
and
grain
since
Adam
be
a
boy
.
the
discovery
by
monk
of
how
to
brow
beer
be
a
process
of
genetic
modification
.
much
of
the
scaremongering
need
to
be
tackle
.
that
normally
feed
into
the
political
process
and
I
believe
it
be
feed
into
the
current
political
process
as
we
see
it
within
the
Council
of
Minister
.
give
the
climactic
chaos
that
be
occur
globally
,
the
EU
must
take
a
firm
line
on
this
.
Climactic
incident
throughout
the
world
and
global
food
shortage
mean
science
must
deliver
seed
and
grain
to
ensure
food
security
.
I
call
on
the
government
to
think
ahead
about
the
permutation
for
Irish
agriculture
's
position
at
EU
level
.
to
be
frank
,
the
government
have
be
sit
on
the
fence
.
I
call
on
Fianna
Fáil
member
to
press
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
which
I
will
do
in
my
capacity
as
a
opposition
spokesperson
,
to
adopt
a
rational
approach
to
the
issue
.
the
future
of
Irish
agriculture
depend
on
it
.
it
would
be
no
problem
to
get
the
information
through
.
on
behalf
of
the
joint
committee
,
I
thank

I
,
too
,
welcome
this
comprehensive
presentation
,
from
which
many
question
arise
.
in
term
of
the
draft
directive
's
objective
,
will
specific
pesticide
in
common
use
be
ban
?
if
one
of
the
objective
set
out
by
the
European
Commission
be
to
improve
the
behaviour
of
pesticide
user
by
ensure
good
training
and
education
,
will
every
pesticide
user
in
the
land
,
regardless
of
profession
,
require
certification
?
be
this
matter
to
be
return
for
a
second
Reading
at
the
Council
of
Minister
?
be
there
stumble
block
between
the
European
Parliament
's
reading
of
the
directive
,
the
second
Reading
by
the
Council
of
Minister
and
where
the
issue
stand
?
the
official
's
assessment
state
the
text
of
the
agreement
will
be
finalise
in
the
official
language
of
the
European
Union
with
a
view
to
its
formal
adoption
by
the
Council
.
be
this
a
fait
accompli
or
must
negotiation
be
undertake
before
the
second
Reading
by
the
Council
and
the
directive
be
place
before
the
European
Parliament
again
?
this
issue
arise
from
the
Sixth
environment
Action
Programme
of
the
European
Community
2002
—
2012
and
be
,
therefore
,
a
matter
that
could
have
be
foreseen
.
that
involve
in
the
food
industry
and
agri-business
may
fear
that
the
directive
will
be
so
prescriptive
regard
practice
that
they
will
experience
unnecessary
cost
.
we
all
recognise
that
the
use
of
pesticide
must
be
regulate
but
my
question
remain
.
I
thank
Mr.
Sheridan
,
Mr.
Cassidy
,
Mr.
Rennick
and
Ms
Dillon
for
they
attendance
today
.
they
contribution
have
be
most
informative
.
we
next
meeting
will
scrutinise
EU
legislative
proposal
on
gmo
.
thank
you
,
Chairman
,
and
I
thank
the
contributor
for
what
they
have
place
before
we
.
one
sense
a
shift
in
the
government
's
position
.
the
committee
should
know
,
either
from
today
's
contributor
or
directly
from
the
minister
,
the
exact
and
unequivocal
government
position
on
genetically
modify
food
.
I
be
confused
about
the
process
.
I
appreciate
there
be
a
stringent
scientific
process
and
I
be
not
a
scientist
.
a
rationale
be
apply
and
one
must
go
along
with
rational
science
with
regard
to
testing
and
so
on
.
if
a
qualified
majority
be
not
reach
at
the
Council
of
Minister
and
the
decision
revert
to
the
commission
,
how
do
the
commission
have
the
mandate
to
make
a
decision
on
genetically
modify
organism
if
no
decision
have
be
make
at
Council
?
if
I
be
misinterpret
the
statement
make
,
I
will
welcome
correction
.
I
would
like
clarification
on
that
point
.
the
Herculex
incident
be
well
document
.
be
the
government
satisfied
with
the
level
and
extent
of
testing
of
product
come
into
the
EU
?
be
the
government
satisfied
with
the
level
of
testing
?
there
be
a
dichotomy
,
give
the
fact
that
unauthorised
GM
food
have
be
import
here
over
a
period
of
year
and
the
government
seem
to
believe
there
be
no
inconsistency
between
this
and
state
Ireland
be
GM
free
.
perhaps
there
be
a
distinction
to
be
make
between
cultivation
and
importation
.
from
the
point
of
view
of
protect
agriculture
,
I
do
not
see
a
contradiction
between
the
importation
of
GM
substance
that
have
be
rigorously
test
and
the
government
be
take
a
firm
position
at
Council
level
on
that
process
and
maintain
biodiversity
.
in
a
nutshell
,
the
government
need
to
take
a
less
ambivalent
position
on
the
matter
.
it
need
to
be
unequivocal
at
Council
level
ves
-à
-
vis
the
process
of
GM
importation
.
the
meeting
be
adjourn
until
6
February
2008

representative
of
Veterinary
Ireland
and
the
Veterinary
Council
of
Ireland
will
be

the
meeting
be
adjourn
until
6
February
2008
when
representative
of
Veterinary
Ireland
and
the
Veterinary
Council
of
Ireland
will
be
in
attendance
.
I
must
apologise
in
advance
because
I
have
to
speak
in
the
House
and
will
have
to
leave
immediately
after
ask
my
question
.
I
thank
the
delegation
for
its
presentation
.
Mr.
O'Rourke
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
he
state
we
great
little
country
now
have
a
system
where
every
aspect
of
human
behaviour
or
economic
or
social
practice
be
be
regulate
in
some
way
or
fashion
.
however
,
the
resource
to
enforce
regulation
be
not
available
.
Veterinary
Ireland
and
the
Veterinary
Council
of
Ireland
be
willing
partner
in
the
act
and
act
in
partnership
during
its
formulation
.
however
,
we
now
have
a
situation
where
there
be
penalisation
in
term
of
how
the
regulation
and
the
act
be
enforce
.
if
rural
Ireland
and
we
agribusiness
be
to
thrive
,
this
must
be
predicate
on
a
fully
finance
veterinary
practice
,
no
matter
how
big
or
small
it
may
be
.
I
support
wholeheartedly
the
call
be
make
today
.
the
situation
be
that
the
regulation
be
draft
on
the
eastern
seaboard
but
they
have
vast
implication
for
that
live
in
the
rest
of
the
country
.
sometimes
the
people
draft
the
regulation
do
not
realise
fully
the
extent
of
the
problem
or
the
financial
hardship
they
will
impose
on
that
operating
business
in
rural
area
.
therefore
,
I
fully
support
the
call
be
make
.
I
be
not
sure
whether
the
representative
can
answer
my
one
question
.
it
be
possibly
a
matter
for
the
minister
to
answer
it
and
perhaps
we
should
put
it
to
she
.
if
financial
assistance
be
give
by
way
of
grant
aid
to
individual
vet
,
could
that
be
deem
a
state
aid
?
I
hope
not
and
that
we
would
be
in
a
position
to
provide
that
financial
assistance
.
if
we
be
go
to
legislate
to
modify
behaviour
and
practice
,
we
should
at
least
be
able
to
legislate
to
provide
the
assistance
and
support
to
back
up
that
legislation
.
be
it
agree
that
the
report
on
the
meeting
will
be
pass
on
to
the
minister
and
she
official
?
agree
.
I
thank
Mr.
Horan
and
he
colleague
from
Veterinary
Ireland
and
Mr.
Connolly
and
he
colleague
from
the
Veterinary
Council
of
Ireland
for
attend
the
meeting
.
they
contribution
have
be
most
informative
and
be
of
great
assistance
to
we
in
we
work
.
the
witness
meet
various
group
of
we
early
.
I
wish
they
well
.
we
will
do
all
in
we
power
to
assist
they
.
at
we
next
meeting
we
will
scrutinise
EU
proposal
on
fishing
activity
.
I
will
not
expound
my
theory
on
the
vast
potential
of
fishery
that
this
maritime
nation
squander
over
the
year
because
of
political
expediency
.
that
be
for
another
day
.
however
,
as
I
understand
the
submission
it
relate
to
the
400
,
plus
850
,
plus
8,000
boat
that
be
operate
in
third
country
water
or
outside
EU
water
.
do
the
legislative
proposal
place
a
great
regulatory
burden
on
that
vessel
,
on
top
of
the
exist
regulatory
framework
,
vis
-à
-
vis
reporting
and
other
bureaucratic
mechanism
?
will
the
proposal
in
any
way
limit
the
scope
of
Irish
vessel
to
be
able
to
fish
in
third
country
water
?
will
the
Regional
Fishery
Management
organisation
's
agreement
be
limit
by
the
European
Union
?
if
we
be
talk
about
third
country
or
non-EU
water
,
if
we
can
expand
the
scope
for
Irish
fisherman
to
maximise
they
potential
in
that
water
,
that
be
what
we
should
try
to
do
.
if
legislation
be
propose
which
seek
to
limit
that
,
perhaps
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
should
look
at
that
issue
.
if
I
be
miss
the
point
of
the
legislative
proposal
in
that
regard
then
I
stand
correct
.
I
thank
Dr.
Beamish
and
Ms
Kelly
for
they
attendance
today
and
for
help
we
in
we
scrutiny
process
.
they
contribution
have
be
most
informative
and
of
great
assistance
to
we
in
we
work
.
for
the
information
of
member
,
a
list
of
observation
will
be
draw
up
from
today
's
debate
for
agreement
at
next
week
's
meeting
before
forward
to
the
Joint
Committee
on
European
Scrutiny
.
the
meeting
stand
adjourn
until
Wednesday
,
20
February
at
11.30
a.m.
when
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
deputy
Sargent
,
will
be
in
attendance
to
discuss
farmer
's
market
and
GM
-
free
Ireland
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
must
compliment
he
for
succeed
in
put
this
issue
on
the
political
agenda
,
which
I
welcome
,
because
it
give
recognition
to
it
as
a
sector
of
we
economy
with
great
potential
to
add
value
to
local
community
.
there
be
a
number
of
farmer
's
market
in
my
constituency
,
include
the
one
in
Midleton
,
to
which
I
be
a
regular
visitor
.
as
they
be
by
they
nature
organic
in
they
organisation
,
with
local
people
come
together
to
sell
they
produce
,
I
would
not
favour
any
mechanism
that
would
overregulate
farmer
's
market
.
much
can
be
do
to
provide
resource
,
include
water
and
electricity
supply
if
need
be
.
however
,
they
should
not
be
overregulate
regard
,
for
example
,
apple
need
to
be
measure
or
have
the
dirt
clean
off
they
.
the
duck
egg
I
buy
from
Castlelyons
market
on
a
Saturday
morning
should
not
need
to
be
regulate
to
a
degree
.
farmer
's
market
need
to
be
retain
as
a
organic
organisation
.
we
cannot
apply
the
same
stricture
that
apply
to
,
for
instance
,
a
restaurant
,
café
or
other
food
outlet
to
a
farmer
's
market
.
we
be
go
in
the
right
direction
because
there
be
a
political
recognition
of
they
importance
.
they
add
value
to
the
local
economy
and
I
welcome
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
in
that
respect
.
person
at
the
farmer
's
market
know
how
to
charge
too
.
there
be
a
ambivalence
in
the
government
's
position
on
this
issue
.
the
position
the
government
have
take
at
Council
of
Minister
level
be
one
in
which
,
one
sense
from
the
position
of
abstention
,
there
have
be
a
shift
.
in
spite
of
the
scientific
advice
and
rationale
apply
by
the
EU
scientific
committee
,
the
government
be
go
against
this
advice
and
have
adopt
a
position
against
the
importation
of
EU
scientific
committee
-
approve
feedstuff
.
if
that
be
the
government
's
position
or
if
the
government
have
arrive
at
a
new
position
,
there
must
be
no
ambivalence
about
it
.
it
must
be
clearly
communicate
to
the
agricultural
sector
because
farmer
who
be
feed
livestock
will
need
to
know
the
government
's
position
on
this
matter
.
I
be
not
a
scientist
,
I
be
a
layman
,
but
my
view
be
that
we
must
rely
on
science
.
the
EU
scientific
committee
have
apply
a
certain
rationale
which
be
base
on
common
sense
and
practical
solution
.
if
it
be
advocate
a
certain
position
,
I
do
not
understand
why
the
government
be
not
adhere
to
that
advice
or
why
it
would
abstain
on
vote
when
the
time
come
.
what
we
be
talk
about
be
whether
Irish
agriculture
can
sustain
its
competitiveness
and
,
ultimately
,
whether
Irish
consumer
will
have
to
pay
for
the
increase
cost
of
feedstuff
that
arise
from
the
non-importation
of
scientifically
-
approve
feedstuff
from
the
EU
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
it
will
have
a
negative
permutation
for
consumer
.
if
this
feedstuff
be
not
approve
,
the
inevitable
outcome
be
that
we
will
begin
import
cheap
produce
that
be
feed
on
genetically
modify
organism
.
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
apply
a
more
rational
approach
.
the
Minister
of
State
say
in
he
presentation
:
I
have
consistently
say
that
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
be
not
about
ban
import
feed
but
rather
about
seek
to
negotiate
the
establishment
of
a
all
-
Ireland
GM
-
free
zone
so
that
we
can
avoid
the
release
of
live
gmo
into
the
Irish
environment
.
the
minister
say
he
be
not
against
ban
import
feed
.
will
he
tell
we
unequivocally
whether
he
be
oppose
to
the
banning
of
genetically
modify
feed
that
be
scientifically
approve
by
the
EU
?
we
require
a
clear
statement
of
government
policy
.
there
must
be
no
ambivalence
at
this
stage
in
the
process
.
there
be
no
dichotomy
or
contradiction
between
maintain
the
biodiversity
of
this
island
and
the
importation
of
EU
-
approve
feedstuff
.
the
two
be
not
mutually
exclusive
.
it
be
reasonable
to
express
reservation
about
scientific
trial
on
the
growth
of
GM
feedstuff
pend
further
debate
and
dialogue
.
however
,
if
the
EU
scientific
committee
advise
and
recommend
that
we
import
certain
feedstuff
,
I
do
not
see
why
the
government
cannot
approve
it
.
we
have
all
buy
into
that
process
by
virtue
of
we
membership
of
the
EU
.
the
precautionary
principle
be
roll
out
when
it
be
politically
expedient
to
do
so
.
the
Green
wedge
or
wing
of
the
government
have
a
politically
philosophical
position
on
this
issue
and
there
be
a
certain
constituency
to
which
it
must
play
.
this
be
to
the
detriment
of
Irish
agriculture
and
ultimately
the
Irish
consumer
who
will
end
up
,
if
we
continue
on
this
route
,
pay
less
but
without
a
guarantee
that
import
livestock
or
meat
product
from
third
country
be
GM
-
free
.
why
do
the
government
abstain
?
be
the
minister
of
State
suggest
that
we
be
market
Irish
beef
as
be
GM
-
free
?

I
will
be
brief
.
that
the
scheme
have
be
in
place
for
14
year
be
a
testament
to
its
success
and
without
repeat
too
many
of
deputy
Doyle
's
comment
,
it
be
predicate
on
a
significant
buy
-
in
from
the
farming
organisation
,
farming
community
and
bank
.
the
scheme
's
very
success
mean
it
should
continue
into
reps
4
and
the
method
of
payment
also
should
continue
as
designate
in
reps
2
and
reps
3
.
the
question
be
whether
the
commission
will
agree
to
such
a
proposal
.
I
strongly
advocate
its
continuation
,
through
both
member
's
contact
and
lobbying
at
European
level
.
the
scheme
should
continue
as
be
because
it
be
highly
successful
and
the
Irish
mechanism
should
be
use
as
a
benchmark
for
the
rest
of
Europe
because
of
the
sheer
volume
of
farmer
who
have
take
it
up
,
as
well
as
the
project
increase
over
the
next
six
year
.
member
support
unequivocally
the
IFA
's
position
on
this
issue
.
in
fairness
to
the
minister
and
she
departmental
official
,
through
they
meeting
with
commission
official
I
understand
they
have
be
lobby
hard
on
the
issue
and
member
should
acknowledge
this
.
it
be
a
worthwhile
scheme
that
be
worthy
of
continuation
.
we
support
it
unequivocally
.
it
seem
strange
and
incongruous
that
the
European
Commission
would
make
a
announcement
of
this
nature
at
a
time
when
Ireland
be
set
consider
ratification
of
the
Lisbon
treaty
.
there
be
a
degree
of
naivety
on
its
part
.
be
it
any
wonder
that
there
be
scepticism
about
the
EU
and
its
working
when
decision
like
this
be
make
at
such
time
?
some
will
beg
to
differ
with
I
on
this
issue
.
I
do
not
know
.
I
also
welcome
Mr.
Fagan
and
Mr.
Egan
to
the
meeting
.
the
basis
on
which
the
gentleman
be
here
be
that
there
be
a
strong
perception
within
this
committee
that
there
be
a
problem
,
the
existence
of
which
be
be
communicate
to
we
by
landowner
.
we
feel
it
necessary
to
bring
this
issue
to
the
fore
.
in
term
of
the
submission
that
have
be
make
,
we
all
agree
that
Transport
21
exist
and
acknowledge
the
work
that
have
be
do
by
the
NRA
and
the
infrastructural
project
take
place
.
I
have
certain
issue
with
regard
to
the
Mallow
northern
relief
road
.
I
can
only
speak
about
a
specific
project
where
landowner
negotiate
position
,
agree
to
code
they
property
—
which
be
effectively
what
this
be
about
—
to
the
project
to
deliver
a
northern
relief
road
and
wait
untold
month
for
the
notice
to
treat
to
be
serve
to
be
tell
that
there
be
a
change
in
government
policy
and
that
this
would
not
be
expedite
.
there
be
a
sense
that
landowner
have
enter
into
this
in
good
faith
and
be
then
tell
that
the
whole
thing
be
off
the
card
because
of
government
policy
.
it
be
very
frustrating
for
landowner
who
,
either
themselves
or
through
they
agent
,
have
expend
resource
and
buy
into
a
process
to
be
tell
that
it
be
not
now
happen
.
in
practical
term
,
there
should
be
a
review
of
the
December
2001
agreement
because
it
be
clearly
not
work
to
the
landowner
's
advantage
.
there
be
problem
with
it
and
the
30
-
day
aspect
of
it
.
once
title
and
other
issue
have
be
resolve
,
in
many
instance
,
it
be
clear
that
compensation
be
not
be
pay
within
the
30
-
day
period
.
I
wonder
whether
the
NRA
feel
there
be
scope
for
a
legislative
process
to
review
that
agreement
.
if
we
be
talk
about
land
which
the
NRA
be
seek
to
obtain
for
a
infrastructural
project
for
the
common
good
and
give
that
the
significant
sum
of
over
€
1.37
billion
have
be
expend
on
the
acquisition
of
land
since
2003
and
will
probably
increase
in
the
future
,
perhaps
the
basis
of
such
agreement
for
the
acquisition
of
land
should
be
put
on
a
statutory
footing
.
for
example
,
where
a
landowner
have
not
receive
he
or
she
agree
compensation
after
a
certain
period
,
he
or
she
would
have
a
recourse
to
law
.
I
do
not
expect
the
National
Road
Authority
to
answer
this
question
but
the
matter
should
be
examine
and
put
on
a
firm
footing
.
it
be
the
perception
of
landowner
that
it
be
operate
on
a
ad
hoc
basis
.
the
2001
agreement
be
not
work
in
favour
of
the
landowner
who
buy
into
it
and
become
active
stakeholder
.
the
process
must
be
review
.
deputy
Aylward
be
suffer
withdrawal
symptom
.
regard
the
meeting
in
Belfast
,
there
be
a
certain
political
sensitivity
.
it
be
still
a
positive
meeting
but
I
fully
support
the
Chairman
's
suggestion
.

I
welcome
the
IFA
delegation
.
the
debate
last
week
could
have
be
delay
a
little
further
pend
a
good
discussion
or
exchange
of
view
on
this
issue
,
although
that
be
as
may
be
.
we
view
be
one
which
unashamedly
seek
to
protect
the
national
interest
.
in
seek
to
do
so
,
we
be
protect
we
economy
,
particularly
the
rural
economy
,
and
a
way
of
life
that
be
under
threat
as
matter
stand
.
Commissioner
Mandelson
have
a
agenda
which
be
incongruous
when
compare
to
the
found
principle
of
the
European
Union
on
issue
of
subsidiarity
and
its
position
as
a
community
-
base
trading
bloc
.
while
we
all
recognise
the
WTO
be
here
to
stay
,
I
remain
sceptical
about
the
prospect
of
a
deal
any
time
soon
.
I
also
remain
sceptical
about
the
possibility
of
any
of
this
issue
move
on
in
the
current
political
climate
.
while
the
outcome
of
the
US
presidential
election
will
probably
have
a
major
bear
on
matter
,
it
will
not
be
decide
before
November
.
be
that
as
it
may
,
this
be
a
important
issue
for
Ireland
.
I
welcome
exchange
of
view
such
as
this
and
feel
this
should
happen
more
often
in
this
committee
.
while
one
could
potentially
question
the
relevance
of
this
debate
with
regard
to
they
impact
on
the
final
negotiation
,
it
be
a
matter
for
debate
.
it
be
important
for
the
Irish
Parliament
to
have
its
say
and
to
reflect
this
view
,
and
it
be
important
that
the
minister
would
come
to
the
House
to
report
on
she
negotiation
to
date
.
unlike
Mr.
Walshe
,
I
think
the
minister
's
negotiating
position
be
quite
good
,
as
be
she
speech
last
week
—
I
be
speak
above
the
party
-
political
ambit
in
this
regard
.
I
understand
that
she
have
to
couch
she
language
in
a
certain
way
.
she
should
not
come
out
at
this
stage
and
say
that
no
deal
be
good
than
a
bad
deal
.
there
be
still
some
time
to
play
with
on
this
issue
and
she
should
build
on
the
progress
she
have
make
in
establish
the
alliance
with
19
other
member
state
,
which
could
represent
a
bloc
that
will
hopefully
bring
Commissioner
Mandelson
to
book
on
this
issue
.
she
could
also
perhaps
hitch
she
wagon
to
the
French
caravan
in
seek
to
rein
in
that
gentleman
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
Commissioner
Mandelson
's
agenda
be
totally
at
variance
with
that
of
the
Council
of
Minister
or
the
member
state
.
although
he
be
the
EU
's
representative
at
the
WTO
,
I
wonder
to
what
extent
the
commission
,
a
supra-national
organisation
,
have
power
that
would
supersede
that
of
the
member
state
.
it
be
a
issue
that
need
to
be
clarify
because
we
could
trade
away
the
rural
economy
at
a
time
when
other
sector
of
the
economy
be
in
serious
danger
of
be
undermine
.
the
agribusiness
sector
be
the
one
sector
that
have
remain
a
constant
through
thick
and
thin
throughout
the
history
of
the
State
.
it
be
the
one
that
will
always
be
there
.
if
we
be
to
trade
away
that
concession
that
have
be
hard
win
through
tough
negotiation
since
the
foundation
of
the
EU
,
we
must
call
into
question
the
fundamental
make
-
up
of
the
Union
as
it
be
currently
constitute
.
we
cannot
trade
away
this
issue
lightly
for
the
sake
of
one
man
's
agenda
.
have
read
the
minister
's
speech
and
know
she
position
,
I
believe
she
be
act
in
the
national
interest
.
we
be
still
in
the
middle
of
a
negotiation
and
there
be
uncertainty
as
to
where
it
will
end
.
as
the
Doha
process
begin
in
2001
and
it
be
now
2008
,
it
be
fair
to
ask
where
we
be
go
.
I
do
not
foresee
any
deal
be
conclude
.
I
would
welcome
further
and
regular
exchange
of
view
on
this
issue
between
the
minister
,
the
farming
organisation
and
the
member
of
this
committee
,
perhaps
meet
in
one
room
,
so
that
I
,
as
a
member
of
the
Labour
Party
,
can
reflect
this
view
in
full
view
of
the
minister
and
the
farming
organisation
.
this
would
be
a
important
and
good
way
to
proceed
in
the
future
.
no
,
it
be
too
soon
for
that
.
I
hope
we
will
have
a
response
in
due
course
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
I
thank
Mr.
Walshe
,
the
president
of
the
IFA
,
and
he
colleague
for
attend
the
meeting
today
.
I
apologise
for
be
late
for
the
meeting
as
I
be
unavoidably
detain
.
I
apologise
to
the
people
who
make
the
presentation
as
I
be
not
fully
aware
of
its
content
.
however
,
I
will
acquaint
myself
with
the
submission
that
be
make
and
I
will
make
some
general
point
.
this
be
a
island
nation
,
which
be
a
obvious
thing
to
say
,
but
we
take
no
cognisance
of
we
rich
maritime
history
.
there
be
the
fat
of
the
land
,
but
there
be
also
the
fat
of
the
sea
.
I
agree
with
the
point
make
previously
that
when
the
CAP
be
be
negotiate
all
that
year
ago
,
the
fishing
industry
become
the
poor
relation
and
have
be
ever
since
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
be
a
island
nation
.
we
have
a
wonderful
resource
but
it
be
be
deplet
year
on
year
due
to
environmental
and
other
problem
.
this
be
cause
undue
hardship
.
my
view
be
simple
.
a
minister
with
direct
responsibility
for
marine
and
fishery
at
cabinet
level
be
a
necessity
—
—
——
if
we
be
ever
to
bring
to
the
political
forefront
the
notion
that
fishery
be
a
important
aspect
of
we
economy
.
however
,
fishery
be
important
not
only
to
the
economy
but
also
from
a
social
perspective
,
because
the
fishing
co-operative
in
the
coastal
region
sustain
local
community
.
if
we
do
not
start
think
in
term
of
sustain
that
community
and
prioritise
fishery
at
cabinet
level
,
the
industry
will
go
deep
into
the
morass
.
there
be
political
rhetoric
and
much
cognisance
take
of
the
notion
of
local
food
production
.
while
the
agricultural
lobby
be
a
strong
one
in
term
of
its
political
voice
,
rightly
so
,
the
fishing
lobby
be
not
as
strong
or
do
not
seem
to
have
be
hear
in
recent
year
.
if
we
be
talk
about
local
food
production
,
the
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
food
also
have
to
look
at
fishery
and
they
potential
.
Fish
have
to
come
more
to
the
forefront
as
part
of
the
national
diet
.
that
be
very
general
point
but
it
be
about
change
we
attitude
towards
the
fishing
industry
which
should
be
see
in
a
more
positive
light
.
this
can
only
happen
politically
.
for
it
to
happen
politically
there
have
to
be
a
seat
at
the
cabinet
table
for
a
minister
with
responsibility
for
the
marine
and
fishing
industry
.
that
be
something
I
would
wholeheartedly
support
.
I
will
be
available
to
meet
with
the
gentleman
present
after
the
meeting
or
at
some
future
date
to
hear
about
they
concern
because
I
miss
they
submission
today
.
however
,
I
will
apprise
myself
of
it
.
if
there
be
anything
we
can
do
to
be
of
assistance
,
we
will
certainly
do
it
.

I

for
be

I
be

I
welcome
the
minister
to
the
meeting
.
I
have
monitor
she
progress
from
afar
with
some
admiration
because
she
rise

I
admire
she

relation
and
in
address
agriculture
from
a
island

perspective
.
she
have
be
strong
in
that
respect
and
it
be
a
perspective
with
which
I
agree
.
speak
as
a
member
of
the

generation
,
she
have
be
a
inspiration
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
ageist
—
—
I
empathise
with
the
minister
in
that
sense
and
congratulate
she
on
she
success
to
date
.
since
deputy
Creed
outline
many
of
the
issue
in
which
I
have
a
interest
,
I
will
not
repeat
that
point
.
agricultural
policy
must
be
undertake
from
a
island
of
Ireland
perspective
.
if
I
have
miss
a
presentation
and
this
point
have
be
take
up
,
I
apologise
.
the
co-operation
between
the
two
Department
with
responsibility
for
agriculture
be
necessary
and
vital
.
to
what
extent
be
the
relationship
work
and
will
there
be
a
deepening
of
the
relationship
,
particularly
give
what
the
CAP
health
check
will
mean
for
Irish
agriculture
?
that
be
a
issue
that
will
have
major
significance
for
Irish
farmer
,
North
and
South
.
I
be
delighted
to
be
here
and
would
be
delighted
to
come
back
.
this
have
be
a
useful
exchange
of
view
and
there
be
still
much
to
discuss
.
I
accept
that
we
only
scratch
the
surface
today
.
if
there
be
any
help
that
I
or
my
official
can
give
to
the
committee
,
we
would
be
delighted
to
do
so
.
I
look
forward
to
have
a
close

I
thank
Mr.
Gunning
for
he
presentation
,
which
contain
much
to
digest
.
I
will
confine
my
contribution
to
make
three
or
four
point
.
the
work
of
Coillte
be
regard
positively
.
it
have
a
clear
operational
structure
and
a
mandate
to
try
to
maximise
the
potential
of
wood
and
forestry
in
the
State
.
however
,
speak
as
layman
,
one
sense
from
the
figure
that
there
be
much
great
potential
to
maximise
the
return
from
forestry
,
give
the
land
hold
by
the
company
and
the
market
for
wood
related
product
,
whether
for
sustainable
energy
and
fuel
,
construction
or
other
area
.
base
on
a
€
40
million
profit
on
a
turnover
of
€318
million
,
which
be
predicate
on
the
Medite
acquisition
,
and
give
the
slowdown
in
construction
,
what
be
the
projection
for
profit
in
2008
and
2009
?
perhaps
my
analysis
be
wrong
but
the
Medite
acquisition
will
create
a
blip
in
the
company
's
book
.
will
profit
decline
in
the
next
two
or
three
year
?
to
be
parochial
,
I
have
a
particular
interest
in
the
Ballyhoura
Mountain
as
I
trek
regularly
in
that
area
and
the
Galtee
Mountain
.
I
wonder
whether
the
clear
potential
for
forest
park
be
be
fully
exploit
.
Mr.
Gunning
indicate
the
forest
park
in
Ballyhoura
be
operate
at
a
cost
and
do
not
deliver
a
return
on
investment
,
save
the
social
benefit
which
accrue
from
it
.
he
also
state
the
UK
government
pay
the
Forestry
Commission
£
1
per
visitor
.
in
the
context
of
increase
urbanisation
,
perhaps
the
government
should
consider
introduce
a
similar
scheme
here
.
forest
will
become
natural
playground
for
family
.
I
think
especially
of
the
Ballyhoura
project
and
the
mountain
bike
trail
,
which
be
a
fantastic
resource
.
Friend
of
mine
come
from
far
and
wide
to
use
the
trail
.
I
sense
that
this
aspect
of
forestry
be
still
at
a
early
stage
and
that
it
have
even
great
potential
.
do
Coillte
have
the
potential
to
build
infrastructure
around
that
project
?
for
instance
,
there
be
the
Griffner
Coillte
partnership
.
be
there
any
scope
to
develop
a
residential
component
or
visitor
centre
within
forest
to
encourage
people
live
in
urban
area
to
visit
and
holiday
in
or
adjacent
to
forest
?
I
be
merely
throw
out
idea
.
give
that
forestry
in
Ireland
comprise
10
%
of
the
total
land
area
and
that
the
EU
average
be
44
%
,
what
be
Coillte
's
position
on
the
acquisition
of
land
and
be
there
scope
for
great
land
acquisition
?
I
accept
that
the
current
price
of
land
be
prohibitive
.
Wood
could
become
the
new
gold
in
the
sense
that
it
have
boundless
potential
,
especially
take
into
account
the
potential
for
forestry
and
wind
energy
on
Coillte
's
land
holding
.
this
could
help
to
offset
we
carbon
footprint
but
there
be
also
scope
to
make
money
from
the
development
of
the
economic
potential
.
the
€
40
million
profit
in
2007
seem
small
give
the
potential
of
the
asset
in
question
.
I
would
like
to
see
great
exploitation
of
the
resource
.
what
can
we
as
legislator
do
to
assist
Coillte
to
add
value
,
or
what
government
policy
need
to
be
implement
in
order
to
increase
the
potential
further
?
I
represent
a
constituency
that
be
largely
urban
but
there
be
a
strong
rural
mix
.
there
be
some
mountainous
area
among
the
low
land
and
a
lot
of
the
land
in
the
constituency
of
Cork
East
belong
to
Coillte
.
do
Coillte
have
the
power
to
diversify
further
into
the
broadband
market
if
broadband
be
not
be
provide
through
fibre
optic
or
Eircom
exchange
?
Coillte
could
step
in
where
there
be
variation
in
topography
.
do
Coillte
have
the
potential
to
become
involved
in
that
regard
or
be
it
only
capable
of
allow
access
to
its
land
?
I
would
like
to
see
Coillte
become
directly
involved
in
the
market
if
it
have
the
wherewithal
to
do
so
.
I
welcome
today
's
presentation
.
we
all
know
people
who
traditionally
work
in
forestry
.
one
can
see
that
forestry
have
diversify
from
just
grow
tree
.
I
would
like
to
see
more
diversification
and
I
can
see
great
potential
for
it
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
Coillte
appear
to
be
go
in
that
direction
,
which
be
very
encouraging
.
I
thank
Coillte
's
representative
for
they
contribution
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
I
thank
the
delegation
for
the
presentation
and
the
answer
to
the
question
put
by
member
.
at
the
next
meeting
we
will
discuss
GM
issue
.
I
welcome
the
minister
and
thank
he
for
he
contribution
.
there
be
much
to
digest
with
axis
1
and
axis
4
in
respect
of
what
the
roll
-
out
of
the
new
programme
will
mean
.
if
I
understand
the
minister
correctly
,
axis
4
will
deal
with
the
administrative
cost
of
deal
with
axis
3
.
the
cost
of
administration
and
the
black
hole
,
which
arguably
administration
have
become
in
some
part
of
the
country
,
could
be
test
,
quantify
and
qualified
in
this
context
and
I
welcome
a
distinction
between
the
two
.
should
this
programme
be
examine
in
the
context
of
the
CAP
health
check
,
which
I
understand
will
shift
investment
from
direct
subsidisation
into
what
Commissioner
Fischer
Boel
refer
to
as
develop
the
rural
economy
and
rural
development
,
what
impact
will
the
programme
have
on
the
EU
CAP
health
check
proposal
?
be
the
two
interlink
?
be
they
coincidental
?
will
the
minister
give
we
a
insight
into
this
?
in
my
area
of
north
Cork
,
Avondhu
Development
Group
propose
to
amalgamate
with
Blackwater
resource
Development
.
Avondhu
Development
Group
provide
social
inclusion
programme
and
this
will
be
marry
with
rural
development
programme
.
what
be
the
natural
synergy
between
this
group
?
will
the
focus
shift
towards
rural
development
predominantly
in
the
context
of
the
proposal
before
we
?
the
constituency
I
represent
be
reflective
of
many
rural
constituency
throughout
the
country
.
programme
such
as
this
have
wonderful
aspirational
view
of
community
centre
,
leisure
facility
and
diversify
farm
income
into
tourism
.
not
every
farmer
will
be
able
to
provide
a
tourist
product
and
not
every
person
who
benefit
from
it
will
be
able
to
travel
on
a
road
that
be
adequate
.
my
point
be
that
road
in
north
Cork
be
in
great
need
of
investment
but
be
completely
underfunded
.
the
position
be
the
same
throughout
County
Cork
.
if
we
discuss
the
development
of
a
rural
economy
and
infrastructure
we
must
discuss
adequate
funding
for
local
authority
,
either
manage
by
local
authority
or
co-fund
through
this
programme
with
local
authority
to
ensure
the
infrastructure
,
include
water
,
road
and
sewerage
,
be
there
and
that
it
be
adequate
,
prior
to
discuss
value
-
add
project
.
I
would
heartily
welcome
the
minister
to
the
part
of
the
country
I
represent
to
travel
some
of
the
road
I
must
travel
,
which
be
starve
of
funding
.
it
be
not
right
to
discuss
proper
rural
economy
and
society
without
also
discuss
the
facility
provide
in
that
regard
.
will
the
minister
give
we
he
view
on
this
?
with
regard
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
in
rural
area
,
we
have
a
demographic
of
people
who
have
live
in
rural
Ireland
all
they
life
and
who
have
farm
and
inter-generationally
live
in
a
rural
economy
or
society
.
we
also
have
people
who
be
originally
of
a
urban
mindset
who
move
into
a
rural
economy
,
which
change
the
dynamic
.
how
do
the
minister
propose
to
change
and
enhance
the
quality
of
life
?
what
practical
programme
do
he
envisage
will
bring
this
about
?
I
welcome
the
proposal
on
funding
for
community
-
base
facility
,
but
they
need
to
be
tease
out
a
little
further
.
however
,
there
be
still
a
major
deficit
and
the
danger
be
that
much
of
this
funding
will
go
into
administration
.
we
want
to
see
real
change
and
real
value
add
.
the
deputy
would
be
more
than
welcome
to
come
and
look
at
some
of
we
road
.
deputy
Creed
raise
that
issue
at
the
start
of
the
meeting
.
deputy
Creed
raise
that
issue
at
the
start
of
the
meeting
.
I
second
the
proposal
to
suspend
standing
order
.
I
too
welcome
the
contributor
.
it
would
appear
there
be
no
major
urgency
about
this
proposal
under
the
French
Presidency
.
however
,
it
may
be
deal
with
by
the
subsequent
Presidency
.
if
the
ban
on
AMT
poultry
have
be
in
place
since
1997
,
why
be
the
commission
now
seek
to
amend
regulation
that
would
allow
for
a
great
percentage
of
poultry
import
from
third
country
,
particularly
give
the
inherent
risk
of
such
import
?
I
do
not
understand
why
this
proposal
be
be
put
before
member
state
.
perhaps
I
misunderstand
the
proposal
,
but
my
reading
of
it
suggest
that
it
be
pave
the
way
for
a
increase
in
import
of
poultry
from
third
country
.
there
have
be
,
heretofore
,
a
ban
on
particular
type
of
poultry
product
,
particularly
with
regard
to
AMT
.
I
have
question
which
do
not
relate
to
this
specific
proposal
but
to
the
wide
issue
of
country
of
origin
labelling
.
could
Department
official
outline
to
this
committee
the
current
EU
view
on
that
issue
,
particularly
within
the
context
of
this
regulation
?
be
the
European
Commission
consider
the
whole
culture
of
regulation
with
regard
to
country
of
origin
labelling
?
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
possible
for
the
witness
to
talk
about
the
political
nuance
of
this
issue
;
it
may
not
be
.
however
,
certain
country
clearly
be
oppose
to
any
change
in
the
regime
,
and
that
may
be
why
the
Irish
government
be
find
it
difficult
to
fight
this
issue
politically
at
European
level
.
to
make
a
political
point
,
what
have
occur
in
Cappoquin
be
largely
owe
to
the
fact
that
the
current
EU
regime
do
not
properly
police
country
of
origin
labelling
.
I
welcome
the
presentation
to
the
committee
.
if
we
read
between
the
line
,
however
,
it
become
clear
there
be
no
political
urgency
to
the
proposal
and
,
in
any
event
,
there
seem
to
be
a
block
minority
,
or
possibly
a
majority
.
perhaps
instead
we
should
discuss
the
issue
of
country
-
of
-
origin
labelling
and
examine
what
be
happen
in
the
area
of
food
safety
,
consumer
protection
and
,
I
be
not
ashamed
to
add
,
the
protection
of
Irish
market
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
be
it
possible
for
that
figure
to
be
make
available
to
committee
member
?
the
witness
come
in
to
talk
about
one
issue
but
they
will
be
sidetrack
which
be
inevitable
give
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter
.
I
be
interested
to
hear
there
be
consultation
between
the
Department
and
the
commission
on
the
food
labelling
regime
,
that
the
proposal
put
forward
by
Ireland
be
turn
down
by
the
Commission
in
May
or
June
,
that
a
new
set
of
proposal
be
put
forward
and
the
Department
be
now
expect
a
response
to
they
.
I
ask
about
the
political
situation
vis
-à
-
vis
support
throughout
all
member
state
for
a
complete
overhaul
of
the
regime
.
a
witness
state
that
certain
boundary
have
be
reach
in
the
discussion
and
I
do
not
quite
follow
the
thinking
on
that
.
we
be
talk
about
the
importation
of
foodstuff
,
particularly
poultry
from
25
country
,
and
we
be
not
exactly
sure
from
where
it
be
all
come
.
the
question
be
whether
there
be
political
will
or
a
will
within
the
commission
to
change
the
regime
to
ensure
every
consumer
know
exactly
what
he
or
she
be
purchase
and
from
where
the
product
originate
.
when
do
the
witness
expect
the
timeframe
for
that
consultation
process
with
the
commission
to
end
?
will
there
be
further
consultation
or
will
it
give
rise
to
a
new
commission
proposal
?
I
thank
Mr.
Cronin
for
he
frank
reply
.
be
it
fair
to
ask
why
there
be
resistance
at
commission
level
to
Ireland
introduce
domestic
legislation
relate
to
country
of
origin
labelling
?
would
it
be
appropriate
to
write
to
the
minister
to
ask
he
to
come
to
the
committee
to
discuss
this
matter
?
I
will
not
labour
the
point
.
deputy
McGrath
have
propose
a
six
month
extension
of
the
deadline
apply
to
the
scheme
.
this
be
echo
by
deputy
Creed
and
I
support
that
for
the
pragmatic
reason
outline
.
the
Labour
Party
would
support
the
proposal
also
.
that
be
all
include
.
that
be
all
include
.
that
be
all
include
.
that
be
all
include
.
that
be
all
include
.
that
be
all
include
.
that
be
all
include
.
I
be
try
to
read
between
the
line
and
interpret
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
after
just
one
hearing
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
this
be
a
glaring
admission
that
the
government
have
no
power
to
change
the
labelling
regime
because
the
European
Commission
argue
that
unless
rule
be
harmonise
throughout
the
EU
as
a
whole
,
no
change
can
occur
and
national
legislation
would
create
a
barrier
to
trade
and
potentially
impinge
on
the
single
market
rule
.
that
be
my
interpretation
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
remark
.
we
be
in
situation
where
the
issue
of
substantial
transformation
—
if
I
interpret
the
Minister
of
State
's
speech
correctly
—
will
not
now
be
deal
with
as
a
urgent
matter
in
the
immediate
future
.
the
question
arise
whether
there
will
be
a
labelling
regime
that
will
give
comfort
to
that
who
have
purchase
product
,
who
want
to
know
whether
the
product
have
be
substantially
transform
and
whether
the
label
will
state
as
much
.
if
I
interpret
correctly
the
Minister
of
State
's
contribution
to
the
committee
today
,
I
would
say
no
such
legislation
be
forthcoming
.
what
be
the
timeline
,
choreography
or
chronology
of
the
interaction
between
the
Minister
of
State
and
the
Commission
or
the
between
the
Government
and
the
commission
?
I
understand
that
on
25
June
last
,
the
Irish
authority
re-notify
the
draft
regulation
which
be
not
accept
by
the
commission
on
12
March
.
I
want
to
know
what
transpire
between
12
March
,
25
June
and
today
.
be
there
a
provision
that
allow
for
labelling
to
be
make
clear
and
can
one
get
around
the
rule
of
the
European
Union
framework
that
would
allow
one
to
say
whether
a
product
have
be
substantially
transform
?
a
significant
proportion
of
the
food
industry
in
Ireland
substantially
transform
its
product
.
there
could
be
a
significant
reduction
in
that
market
if
consumer
be
to
have
full
fact
on
the
product
they
purchase
daily
and
be
to
know
the
product
have
be
substantially
transform
in
any
way
.
that
would
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
market
.
if
one
be
go
to
substantially
transform
something
,
one
should
tell
people
it
be
to
be
substantially
transform
and
let
the
consumer
decide
.
if
I
want
to
buy
something
that
be
substantially
transform
such
as
a
packet
of
rasher
or
another
meat
product
,
if
I
happen
to
like
that
product
,
I
will
buy
it
anyway
but
if
I
have
information
on
whether
it
have
be
substantially
transform
,
at
least
that
will
assist
I
in
my
purchase
decision
.
however
,
there
be
no
regulation
or
policing
of
the
packaging
regime
.
the
Minister
of
State
be
say
frankly
that
the
new
legislation
will
not
be
in
place
for
a
couple
of
year
and
that
even
at
that
stage
,
if
I
be
interpret
it
correctly
,
it
will
be
on
the
basis
of
each
member
state
produce
,
of
its
own
volition
,
a
mandatory
indication
.
if
that
be
to
happen
in
a
few
year
,
why
be
it
not
happen
now
?
that
be
the
big
question
.
it
seem
from
the
Minister
of
State
's
contribution
that
thing
will
not
change
.
anyone
who
have
concern
about
the
issue
of
substantial
transformation
,
or
the
labelling
regime
as
a
whole
,
will
not
be
provide
with
any
comfort
from
the
Minister
of
State
's
statement
.
I
ask
about
the
timeline
,
between
March
when
the
commission
give
its
negative
opinion
and
when
the
Irish
authority
re-notify
the
commission
as
to
its
position
,
and
where
we
stand
today
.
I
be
not
satisfied
.
I
accept
what
the
Minister
of
State
say
about
the
move
take
place
at
present
but
what
the
people
want
to
know
,
and
what
I
would
like
to
know
,
be
whether
there
be
sufficient
political
willingness
to
address
this
issue
head
on
.
my
view
be
that
there
be
not
.
I
believe
the
commission
and
the
other
member
state
will
kick
this
matter
to
touch
for
another
while
and
we
might
be
back
here
in
three
year
time
with
no
movement
on
it
.
that
be
why
I
wonder
about
the
timeline
so
far
.
why
do
the
government
go
through
the
process
if
we
be
now
at
a
stage
where
there
will
ultimately
be
a
new
regime
anyway
?
we
be
work
on
the
basis
of
something
that
I
assume
be
in
the
programme
for
government
,
and
on
the
basis
of
a
commitment
by
the
government
.
that
be
the
basis
on
which
we
ask
this
question
.
it
might
be
wise
and
might
be
the
most
honest
thing
if
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
deputy
Smith
,
be
to
state
publicly
that
the
labelling
regime
in
this
country
will
not
now
be
change
and
that
the
government
must
go
through
more
rí-rá
agus
ruaille
-
buaille
,
as
the
Minister
of
State
so
describe
it
,
with
the
member
state
,
and
that
there
will
be
no
outcome
for
a
number
of
year
.
that
might
perhaps
be
the
most
honest
public
statement
to
make
on
the
issue
,
as
a
brid
statement
to
address
the
concern
of
—
—
—
—
people
who
be
worried
about
food
labelling
.
how
?
we
do
not
have
laurel
to
sit
on
because
the
government
have
do
nothing
about
this
issue
for
the
past
year
.
be
be
a
very
interesting
meeting
and
hopefully
we
will
have
the
Minister
of
State
back
again
.
we
will

in
assess
at
first
hand
the
contribution
make
by
the
Irish
dairy
Industry
Association
,
one
conclude
that
the
current
policy
of
seek
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emission
will
result
in
a
net
reduction
in
the
number
of
cow
,
thereby
reduce
production
,
which
will
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
agriculture
sector
.
be
it
fair
to
assume
that
there
be
inherent
flaw
in
the
scientific
analysis
of
greenhouse
gas
emission
with
regard
to
agriculture
?
Mr.
Gilhawley
mention
that
eight
model
herd
be
use
.
be
that
in
a
Irish
context
or
a
European
context
?
the
view
come
across
strongly
here
be
that
there
be
a
long
-
term
political
imperative
to
reduce
greenhouse
emission
and
,
if
I
understand
correctly
,
the
measurement
use
for
agriculture
be
inherently
flawed
,
which
mean
the
final
figure
be
flawed
.
thus
,
agriculture
be
not
as
large
a
transgressor
in
term
of
greenhouse
gas
emission
as
we
would
believe
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
rational
understanding
of
the
logic
here
.
if
the
political
imperative
in
this
country
—
which
come
from
the
Green
Party
,
to
make
no
bone
about
it
—
be
to
reduce
emission
,
be
it
the
case
that
the
assumption
on
which
this
be
base
be
wrong
?
be
it
the
view
of
the
representative
that
base
on
the
current
scientific
analysis
,
change
the
input
—
in
term
of
feedstuff
and
so
on
—
could
have
a
positive
impact
in
term
of
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emission
and
the
production
of
methane
?
I
always
take
the
view
that
agriculture
be
not
the
big
transgressor
here
and
that
it
be
easy
for
the
political
discourse
to
target
it
.
there
be
so
many
other
mechanism
that
can
be
use
.
we
need
only
look
at
the
amount
of
waste
and
packaging
produce
but
that
have
not
be
target
in
a
similar
way
,
politically
,
to
agriculture
.
that
be
something
this
government
need
to
consider
.
with
regard
to
milk
price
,
what
be
the
actual
equilibrium
rate
or
economic
rate
of
return
for
milk
production
,
in
term
of
the
market
as
we
see
it
now
and
in
five
to
ten
year
'
time
after
—
in
a
bad
case
scenario
—
a
10
%
reduction
?
the
view
of
the
representative
be
that
if
production
move
from
Ireland
to
country
where
there
be
less
regulation
,
that
will
have
effect
in
its
own
right
.
the
question
be
,
politically
,
how
do
we
stop
that
flow
?
I
be
not
sure
whether
the
political
will
be
currently
there
within
the
WTO
to
do
this
.
do
Commissioner
Fischer
Boel
have
the
political
will
to
do
it
?
my
analysis
be
that
she
do
not
because
she
be
try
to
push
through
a
number
of
what
she
would
term
to
be
reform
—
cap
reform
and
the
CAP
health
check
—
which
will
see
pillar
1
to
pillar
2
-
type
spending
.
that
will
have
a
serious
impact
on
agricultural
production
here
in
the
long
run
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
great
understanding
of
how
we
in
this
committee
can
lobby
we
government
and
what
the
government
need
to
do
at
the
Council
of
Minister
and
at
WTO
level
to
stem
the
reduction
.
be
there
a
alternative
analysis
to
that
be
put
forward
by
what
I
would
term
the
establishment
in
term
of
the
reduction
in
cattle
production
,
which
we
can
get
we
tooth
into
and
give
a
differ
view
?
I
take
the
view
simply
that
agriculture
be
the
one
sector
that
have
remain
constant
despite
the
fluctuation
in
the
wide
economy
.
we
should
not
throw
out
milk
and
meat
production
for
the
sake
of
attain
the
goal
of
decrease
global
greenhouse
gas
emission
if
we
will
find
in
the
long
run
that
we
analysis
be
wrong
.
that
be
the
point
I
be
try
to
make
in
a
very
convoluted
way
.
I
ask
the
chairman
to
forgive
I
.
a
alternative
analysis
need
to
be
put
forward
.
there
be
nothing
within
the
presentation
that
I
would
disagree
with
but
the
politics
of
this
will
become
very
important
.
it
all
depend
on
how
much
power
be
wield
in
government
by
the
Green
wing
and
whether
this
wing
will
seek
to
use
it
as
a
political
stick
to
gain
concession
.
that
be
not
something
I
expect
the
representative
to
answer
,
but
it
be
a
view
that
need
to
be
put
forward
.
on
behalf
of
the
joint
committee
,
I
thank
Mr.
Barry
,
Mr.
Gilhawley
and
Mr.
Kelly
for
they
informative
presentation
and
answer
the
question
raise
.
I
be
very
glad
that
they
be
willing
to
come
back
at
a
late
stage
,
if
necessary
.
I
propose
that
we
go
into
private
session
to
deal
with
some
housekeeping
matter
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
I
also
welcome
the
departmental
official
.
I
will
pose
some
brief
question
to
begin
with
.
how
do
the
Department
see
the
market
for
milk
evolve
post
-2015
?
we
be
talk
about
a
increase
in
quota
up
to
2015
,
although
there
be
a
strong
view
emanate
from
producer
within
the
sector
that
there
should
be
no
further
increase
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
Department
's
response
to
this
view
.
as
regards
the
post
-2015
scenario
,
do
the
Department
envisage
that
there
will
be
far
few
milk
producer
?
will
there
be
a
great
consolidation
of
farm
holding
as
a
result
?
will
we
follow
the
UK
model
which
,
arguably
,
be
not
necessarily
the
good
one
?
there
be
a
certain
critique
into
which
I
will
not
delve
.
on
modulation
,
a
movement
of
funding
from
pillar
1
to
pillar
2
would
be
significant
.
there
be
a
lack
of
clarity
on
who
would
control
the
spend
.
if
it
be
envisage
that
some
of
this
spend
would
be
encompass
by
the
rural
development
programme
,
do
this
mean
that
the
Department
would
no
long
have
control
of
it
?
would
it
be
under
the
control
of
the
department
of
community
,
rural
and
Gaeltacht
affair
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
certain
issue
would
arise
.
will
we
guest
clarify
the
position
on
the
Department
's
thinking
in
respect
of
that
process
?
I
will
await
a
response
to
the
point
I
have
raise
and
proceed
from
there
.
what
do
Mr.
O'Driscoll
mean
by
the
term
"
effective
market
management
measure
"
,
which
he
have
use
three
or
four
time
?
what
scheme
?
may
I
ask
a
brief
question
,
as
we
do
not
get
this
opportunity
too
often
?
on
the
modulation
issue
with
regard
to
the
rural
development
scheme
there
be
a
perception
that
a
income
could
be
derive
by
a
farmer
vis
-à
-
vis
the
new
challenge
that
be
speak
about
—
climate
change
,
bio-energy
,
water
management
and
biodiversity
.
in
term
of
management
of
the
countryside
,
if
I
may
use
that
euphemism
,
will
that
be
take
from
they
as
a
source
of
income
effectively
and
be
put
into
leader
group
,
rural
development
committee
and
organisation
,
where
it
could
find
its
way
into
a
black
hole
?
I
be
seek
to
get
a
guarantee
about
modulation
and
management
of
the
countryside
.
some
assurance
must
be
give
to
that
who
be
involved
in
the
sector
that
they
will
not
lose
a
income
stream
and
that
it
will
not
go
into
that
so
-
call
black
hole
of
rural
development
.
this
be
important
.
be
there
discretion
in
that
regard
?
the
political
wind
be
blow
against
the
ICMSA
's
position
on
milk
quota
.
however
,
I
be
glad
we
have
hear
a
alternative
view
.
how
realistic
be
it
to
have
adopt
at
the
Council
of
Minister
a
proposal
that
would
result
in
the
increasing
of
quota
or
the
maintenance
of
quota
after
2015
?
can
the
floor
price
for
milk
be
sustain
if
the
Council
of
Minister
and
CAP
health
check
proposal
be
accept
as
envisage
?
in
the
context
of
open
the
market
,
can
a
floor
milk
price
be
maintain
both
in
the
short
term
prior
to
final
implementation
of
the
proposal
and
in
the
long
term
?

I
welcome
the
representative
of
Teagasc
.
when
we
think
about
Teagasc
which
have
a
presence
in
many
community
,
there
be
a
sense
of
positivity
about
its
multifaceted
work
in
area
such
as
education
,
research
and
consultancy
.
while
I
acknowledge
that
its
educational
role
be
increase
,
I
wonder
if
the
course
mention
in
the
presentation
would
be
so
popular
if
the
boom
in
the
construction
industry
be
ongoing
.
I
would
like
to
go
off
on
a
tangent
by
discuss
the
potential
of
the
agriculture
sector
for
the
economy
of
rural
Ireland
,
with
particular
reference
to
research
.
will
the
representative
of
Teagasc
give
we
detail
of
the
cutting
-
edge
research
be
conduct
in
the
agriculture
and
rural
economy
sector
?
the
agriculture
sector
have
a
major
opportunity
to
diversify
into
the
production
of
energy
from
source
such
as
methane
.
I
will
not
refer
to
it
as
alternative
energy
production
because
it
be
about
to
become
mainstream
.
I
ask
the
delegate
to
outline
what
Teagasc
be
do
in
this
regard
.
it
would
not
be
a
bad
idea
for
member
of
the
committee
to
visit
some
of
the
Teagasc
site
where
research
be
take
place
to
obtain
more
information
on
its
research
function
.
person
in
my
local
area
be
very
proud
of
the
work
that
take
place
at
the
Moorepark
research
centre
in
the
heart
of
my
constituency
.
while
it
may
be
a
cliché
to
refer
to
it
as
the
jewel
in
the
crown
of
the
east
Cork
region
,
we
be
proud
of
the
centre
and
the
research
do
there
.
without
be
too
parochial
,
what
do
the
future
hold
for
centre
such
as
Moorepark
and
local
office
like
the
one
in
Mallow
?
I
understand
the
provision
make
for
Teagasc
in
the
2009
budget
represent
a
decrease
of
approximately
8
%
.
what
impact
will
the
decrease
,
from
€
132
million
to
€
122
million
,
have
on
the
delivery
of
service
?
will
the
delegate
give
we
some
feedback
?
on
a
point
of
order
,
I
understand
what
Professor
Boyle
be
say
about
awareness
and
sustainability
,
but
we
would
take
that
as
a
give
.
I
be
specifically
ask
about
research
project
on
methane
and
the
greening
of
agriculture
.
in
regard
to
the
research
function
,
I
understand
Professor
Boyle
's
point
about
the
return
.
in
term
of
scientific
proposal
that
be
make
,
I
understand
Teagasc
tender
for
external
research
and
that
the
Department
have
a
tendering
process
in
this
regard
.
in
term
of
the
internal
research
function
,
the
proposal
make
and
the
internal
return
,
as
a
lay
man
I
wonder
how
many
proposal
will
come
forward
to
Teagasc
on
a
annual
basis
,
internally
,
and
how
many
Teagasc
make
return
on
in
term
of
viability
economically
or
in
respect
of
a
contribution
to
other
component
in
the
scientific
community
.
from
a
geopolitical
perspective
,
methane
be
come
on
the
agenda
and
there
will
be
a
global
move
to
reduce
herd
number
.
the
basis
of
that
will
be
the
production
of
methane
.
the
scientific
community
must
come
up
with
something
or
the
alternative
will
be
to
reduce
herd
number
.
I
be
not
propose
that
we
reduce
herd
number
but
I
wonder
where
the
scientific
community
be
in
respect
or
this
.
the
delegation
state
that
research
be
take
place
in
Oak
Park
,
though
I
think
it
be
at
Grange
.
I
be
try
to
ascertain
whether
we
be
ahead
of
,
on
or
behind
the
curve
in
term
of
where
science
be
.
be
there
a
appetite
for
take
-
up
of
the
voluntary
retirement
scheme
or
have
it
be
finalise
?
regard
operating
expense
,
I
note
expenditure
of
€
2.4
million
for
postage
and
telephone
in
2007
.
fuel
and
petrol
amount
to
€
2.1
million
.
I
understand
Teagasc
have
1400
employee
and
it
be
a
expensive
spend
.
how
do
Teagasc
gain
efficiency
in
respect
of
the
service
provider
for
telephone
?
do
it
tender
on
a
annual
basis
?
be
it
practical
to
do
so
?
can
the
delegation
give
we
a
idea
of
how
Teagasc
operate
from
that
perspective
?
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
Professor
Boyle

Mr.
Carey

Mr.

do
the
Department
acknowledge
there
be
a
system
failure
and
that
the
Department
itself
have
some
degree
of
culpability
for
what
happen
in
December
.
we
be
now
in
a
situation
where
a
allowance
of
up
to
€
180
million
have
be
make
available
from
taxpayer
's
money
to
assist
a
industry
that
could
have
be
on
its
knee
because
of
that
same
system
failure
.
I
would
like
the
Department
to
acknowledge
this
publicly
today
.
I
will
get
straight
into
the
specifics
and
ask
whether
the
substance
that
be
use
in
the
Millstream
plant
in
Bunclody
be
illegal
.
to
refer
specifically
to
—
—
let
we
get
to
the
specifics
straight
away
.
if
I
may
,
I
will
go
straight
to
what
have
be
say
.
the
Secretary
General
state
that
laboratory
test
have
indicate
that
the
source
of
the
contamination
be
the
use
of
contaminate
or
inappropriate
oil
to
fire
the
burner
use
for
generate
the
heat
to
dry
the
bread
.
we
be
also
tell
the
Garda
be
now
assist
the
process
.
I
would
like
to
know
whether
a
illegal
process
be
take
place
or
whether
it
be
a
process
that
be
not
govern
by
regulation
.
if
it
be
a
illegal
process
,
that
be
fair
enough
,
and
I
be
sure
the
full
rigour
of
the
law
will
apply
,
but
if
it
be
not
govern
by
proper
regulation
in
the
first
instance
,
that
speak
to
the
fact
there
be
a
system
failure
which
put
the
whole
industry
practically
on
its
knee
for
that
period
.
to
be
frank
,
I
welcome
the
political
action
take
to
deal
with
this
matter
in
term
of
the
withdrawal
,
which
be
necessary
.
however
,
serious
question
arise
about
the
failure
of
regulation
.
why
be
it
,
in
the
first
24
hour
of
the
crisis
,
that
ordinary
people
and
that
like
myself
do
not
know
who
be
answerable
in
term
of
the
food
regulatory
regime
?
we
do
not
know
whether
it
be
the
food
Safety
Authority
of
Ireland
or
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
and
there
be
some
degree
of
confusion
.
if
we
be
to
learn
anything
from
this
debate
,
I
suggest
there
must
be
one
voice
in
this
country
speak
on
the
issue
of
food
safety
.
somebody
should
be
appoint
,
not
necessarily
a
new
regulatory
regime
,
but
one
voice
who
will
come
out
definitively
to
speak
when
such
issue
arise
.
this
be
vital
and
will
get
rid
of
any
confusion
on
such
issue
.
while
I
will
leave
it
at
that
for
now
,
the
Department
's
official
should
acknowledge
whether
they
consider
that
a
system
failure
take
place
in
the
first
instance
.
would
there
have
be
a
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
dutch
at
that
stage
to
notify
the
EFSA
as
to
the
high
level
of
dioxin
in
the
September
testing
?
it
seem
,
from
what
Mr.
Moran
state
,
that
it
be
only
when
the
Department
give
notification
through
the
website
that
the
information
seem
to
come
to
light
.
the
delegation
will
forgive
my
ignorance
,
but
I
seek
a
understanding
of
the
process
between
September
and
December
.
the
Secretary
General
state
that
the
information
first
come
to
he
attention
on
5
December
and
that
testing
take
place
in
September
which
clearly
indicate
marker
for
polychlorinate
biphenyl
,
pcb
,
in
the
Netherlands
.
even
if
there
be
no
specific
indication
of
the
source
of
the
pcb
,
surely
there
be
some
notification
to
the
European
food
Safety
Authority
,
EFSA
,
indicate
there
be
pcb
marker
discover
within
the
European
Union
.
be
the
EFSA
notify
or
not
?
if
it
be
not
notify
,
perhaps
there
be
no
obligation
to
do
so
.
perhaps
the
Secretary
General
could
clarify
this
for
the
committee
.
such
a
explanation
would
tally
event
up
to
5
December
.
I
do
not
understand
what
Mr.
Moran
be
say
.
forgive
my
ignorance
,
but
I
do
not
understand
the
point
the
Secretary
General
be
make
.
he
state
that
there
be
a
background
test
carry
out
by
the
French
which
take
place
in
September
.
he
say
it
be
a
French
test
.
I
will
continue
as
I
be
try
to
understand
event
.
the
Secretary
General
state
that
the
test
result
come
back
to
the
FSAI
.
where
be
the
communication
to
the
FSAI
?
what
be
communicate
to
it
and
do
it
relate
to
a
Irish
carcase
?
do
this
occur
in
September
?
this
be
what
we
be
try
to
find
out
.
on
the
same
point
,
the
French
and
Belgian
have
a
line
of
communication
with
the
dutch
date
back
to
September
.
I
understand
that
while
pcb
be
find
,
it
be
not
establish
that
they
emanate
from
Ireland
until
4
December
when
the
press
release
be
issue
.
be
there
a
onus
on
the
Netherlands
or
any
other
member
state
for
that
matter
to
notify
the
European
food
Safety
Authority
of
the
existence
of
pcb
?
should
all
other
country
not
have
be
alert
to
this
fact
?
that
be
the
key
point
on
which
the
joint
committee
require
clarification
.
for
the
purpose
of
the
haccp
legislation
,
would
the
operator
at
the
centre
of
this
dioxin
issue
have
be
deem
a
food
business
operator
?
go
back
to
my
initial
contribution
,
if
the
source
of
the
contamination
be
as
a
result
of
the
use
of
contaminate
or
inappropriate
oil
to
fire
the
burner
use
for
generate
the
heat
to
dry
the
bread
,
which
be
Mr.
Moran
's
own
word
,
do
the
haccp
or
any
other
legislation
govern
the
use
of
a
particular
type
of
fuel
for
the
purpose
of
produce
feedstuff
for
cattle
or
pig
within
the
Irish
market
?
do
such
legislation
apply
to
any
foodstuff
for
that
matter
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
be
it
propose
that
a
regulation
be
bring
in
to
ensure
particular
type
of
fuel
be
use
or
that
there
be
a
regulatory
framework
govern
the
type
of
fuel
?
my
interpretation
—
I
should
be
correct
if
I
be
wrong
—
be
that
no
legislation
govern
the
type
of
fuel
use
in
the
production
of
feedstuff
.
forgive
I
if
I
be
wrong
but
I
seek
clarification
on
the
matter
.
with
regard
to
traceability
,
I
take
deputy
Scanlon
's
point
about
the
nature
of
the
beast
,
so
to
speak
,
with
regard
to
traceability
right
down
to
the
end
use
.
I
acknowledge
that
when
the
problem
be
identify
,
it
be
easy
within
a
reasonable
timeframe
to
identify
the
source
of
the
contamination
and
its
consequence
.
be
every
single
foodstuff
regulate
?
be
all
FBOs
govern
by
the
haccp
legislation
?
be
there
a
failure
of
regulation
in
this
regard
?
for
example
,
be
a
contaminant
use
which
,
to
all
intent
and
purpose
,
bring
a
€
1
billion
industry
—
to
use
the
Department
's
own
figure
—
to
its
knee
as
a
result
of
such
a
failure
?
this
be
something
consumer
need
to
know
about
as
well
.
if
we
do
not
learn
from
this
or
put
in
place
mechanism
to
ensure
that
all
aspect
of
food
production
be
cover
by
some
degree
of
regulation
,
there
be
no
reason
this
cannot
happen
again
.
I
raise
the
point
about
the
fuel
use
to
produce
the
feedstuff
and
whether
that
be
govern
by
a
regulation
.
if
it
be
,
be
there
a
onus
on
the
food
business
operator
in
this
instance
to
notify
as
per
the
national
control
plan
for
Ireland
in
term
of
the
hygiene
package
?
I
do
not
get
a
answer
to
that
question
.
I
wish
to
ascertain
whether
the
fuel
use
in
feedstuff
be
govern
by
a
regulation
.
there
be
a
simple
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
answer
to
that
question
.
that
will
establish
whether
illegal
activity
be
go
on
.
if
we
be
take
about
a
bailout
use
€
180
million
of
taxpayer
's
money
,
then
it
be
right
that
some
of
this
question
be
answer
in
term
of
the
regulatory
framework
.
the
Department
official
need
to
answer
that
question
.
the
oil
question
speak
to
the
traceability
question
because
it
be
a
input
use
in
produce
the
foodstuff
.
on
a
point
of
information
.
if
the
haccp
legislation
do
not
cover
the
use
of
oil
,
can
one
then
infer
that
there
be
no
regulation
govern
the
use
of
fuel
for
the
production
of
feedstuff
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
as
a
result
of
what
happen
,
will
there
be
a
move
to
set
up
a
regulatory
framework
so
that
this
State
and
every
other
state
in
the
European
Union
can
then
ensure
dioxin
of
this
nature
will
never
again
get
into
the
food
chain
in
the
way
that
happen
recently
?
it
be
important
that
we
get
to
the
nub
of
this
.
on
the
one
hand
,
we
be
be
tell
the
food
business
operator
have
a
duty
of
care
,
if
one
like
,
to
ensure
against
any
potential
hazard
,
which
be
the
whole
purpose
of
the
legislation
.
however
,
if
I
understand
correctly
what
Mr.
Moran
be
say
,
there
be
no
overarching
govern
regulation
at
EU
level
in
regard
to
the
use
of
oil
for
the
production
of
feedstuff
.
be
there
,
therefore
,
a
onus
on
the
person
who
be
produce
the
feedstuff
or
be
this
just
a
failure
of
regulation
and
,
therefore
,
anybody
can
use
any
kind
of
oil
as
fuel
for
the
production
of
feedstuff
?
it
seem
the
haccp
legislation
do
not
actually
govern
the
production
of
feedstuff
.
perhaps
now
,
as
a
result
of
this
crisis
,
there
be
a
necessity
for
some
sort
of
regulation
relate
to
the
use
of
particular
type
of
fuel
.
this
be
a
view
on
which
this
committee
need
to
get
some
sort
of
a
steer
,
whether
it
be
a
political
or
a
apolitical
issue
.
since
the
Taoiseach
refer
to
the
term
"
contingent
liability
"
at
some
point
after
6
December
,
I
have
be
at
pain
to
find
a
definition
of
the
phrase
as
it
pertain
to
this
case
.
I
expect
the
€
180
million
package
arise
from
the
fact
that
a
recall
be
issue
at
the
government
's
behest
.
as
a
result
,
that
innocent
producer
,
if
I
may
use
that
phraseology
,
who
,
through
no
fault
of
they
own
,
use
a
certain
type
of
product
lose
production
and
suffer
a
loss
in
profit
.
they
be
,
therefore
,
entitle
to
some
compensation
.
what
be
the
Department
's
view
of
the
compensation
scheme
and
the
€
180
million
fund
in
term
of
liability
?
I
would
like
to
have
a
good
understanding
of
this
issue
as
it
go
to
the
heart
of
the
scheme
.
I
also
wish
to
ask
about
the
statement
make
by
the
Secretary
General
that
the
scheme
be
confine
to
processor
who
have
suffer
loss
as
a
result
of
the
recall
,
and
to
product
relate
to
animal
slaughter
in
Ireland
between
1
September
and
6
December
2008
which
can
not
be
show
to
be
uncontaminated
.
be
it
the
case
that
only
that
people
who
use
the
contaminate
product
will
be
liable
for
the
compensation
package
?
I
seek
clarification
on
that
point
.
to
date
,
a
payment
of
€
35.4
million
have
be
make
and
there
be
64
payment
.
be
that
64
payment
to
64
individual
or
have
some
individual
receive
more
than
one
payment
?
I
be
concerned
also
about
the
worker
who
sustain
a
loss
of
income
as
a
result
of
the
crisis
.
when
the
processor
close
down
,
many
farm
worker
and
other
within
the
processing
industry
lose
income
.
the
question
can
be
ask
whether
they
should
be
entitle
to
some
form
of
compensation
package
for
loss
of
earnings
through
no
fault
of
they
own
.
will
Mr.
Moran
provide
some
clarification
on
that
?
hundred
of
pig
farmer
be
sustain
a
serious
loss
of
income
through
no
fault
of
they
own
,
who
be
not
directly
affect
by
or
who
have
never
use
the
contaminate
product
.
the
question
can
be
ask
also
as
to
whether
they
should
be
eligible
for
some
form
of
compensation
.
I
seek
clarification
on
the
nature
of
the
scheme
,
how
it
be
propose
to
make
the
payment
and
whether
there
will
be
a
full
disclosure
on
how
the
payment
be
make
and
to
whom
.
I
ask
about
compensation
of
worker
and
whether
there
be
a
proposal
in
the
scheme
for
they
.
I
also
ask
about
contingent
liability
.
can
I
get
a
viewpoint
on
that
matter
?
I
be
wonder
when
the
pig
in
the
poke
line
would
be
use
in
the
debate
.
deputy
Creed
get
in
there
.
I
ask
about
contingent
liability
but
I
be
not
satisfied
with
the
answer
I
receive
on
worker
's
compensation
.
if
I
be
interpret
what
the
witness
say
correctly
,
it
be
necessary
to
get
the
scheme
up
and
run
so
that
worker
could
get
back
into
the
plant
but
there
be
still
worker
who
have
suffer
loss
of
earnings
in
the
period
.
could
I
get
a
clarification
,
a
clear
succinct
answer
,
on
whether
there
will
be
fund
available
to
worker
suffer
a
loss
in
wage
for
that
period
?
be
that
envisage
within
the
scheme
?
with
regard
to
restoration
of
the
market
,
I
have
a
view
that
there
be
a
degree
of
political
expediency
go
on
from
the
Russian
point
of
view
.
be
it
the
case
that
the
Russian
think
we
still
have
a
problem
or
be
there
a
certain
degree
of
political
expediency
go
on
from
other
competitor
within
the
market
who
would
probably
have
they
purpose
serve
by
talk
down
the
Irish
product
?
how
far
down
the
line
be
the
department
in
term
of
restore
some
degree
of
confidence
in
the
product
?
be
the
issue
confidence
or
market
consideration
and
economics
?
we
will
get
to
read
about
it
in
30
year

time

thank

.
we
be
try
to
understand
the
anatomy
of
the
crisis
as
it
develop
and
the
response
to
it
,
to
learn
from
this
and
ensure
it
do
not
happen
again
.
the
restoration
of
public
confidence
in
pork
product
before
Christmas
be
largely
due
to
the
EFSA
's
statement
on
the
absence
of
a
risk
to
public
health
.
without
that
statement
there
would
probably
still
be
a
crisis
.
I
understand
the
distinction
make
between
risk
assessment
and
management
.
last
week
we
have
a
detailed
discussion
on
food
hygiene
legislation
and
food
business
operator
and
they
obligation
under
the
legislation
.
where
do
implementation
of
the
haccp
legislation
begin
and
end
?
be
it
solely
a
function
of
national
parliament
or
do
the
EFSA
have
a
role
?
why
be
the
type
of
fuel
use
here
not
govern
by
a
legislative
framework
?
the
haccp
principle
determine
risk
and
outline
a
reporting
procedure
.
be
there
a
failure
of
regulation
?
do
the
EFSA
have
competence
in
frame
the
legislation
or
advise
the
commission
or
national
government
on
its
interpretation
?
do
the
EFSA
have
a
view
on
how
we
can
learn
from
this
event
to
enhance
good
practice
among
supplier
of
food
ingredient
,
how
national
legislature
can
tighten
they
practice
and
how
the
commission
can
ensure
this
do
not
happen
again
?
I
should
state
for
the
public
record
that
,
while
I
welcome
the
fact
that
Dr.
Heppner
have
come
before
the
committee
today
,
we
could
have
receive
many
of
this
answer
by
e-mail
.
this
be
all
part
of
a
learning
curve
that
the
committee
be
on
.
in
term
of
the
question
that
have
be
pose
today
,
I
suggest
we
should
be
speak
to
representative
of
dg
Sanco
,
the
Directorate
General
for
Health
and
consumer
affair
.
for
the
record
,
I
thank
Dr.
Heppner
for
attend
but
we
may
have
waste
she
time
.
perhaps
she
could
still
be
sit
in
a
office
in
Brussels
.
I
thank
Mr.
Reilly
and
he
colleague
for
come
before
the
committee
today
,
for
they
comprehensive
presentation
and
for
answer
the
question
raise
.
I
thank
Mr.
Reilly
and
he
colleague
for
come
before
the
committee
today
,
for
they
comprehensive
presentation
and
for
answer
the
question
raise
.
not
mean
in
any
way
to
be
facetious
,
this
document
,
read
objectively
,
be
like
a
advertisement
for
waste
incineration
,
and
let
we
not
put
too
fine
a
point
on
that
.
I
start
from
that
base
point
and
say
so
objectively
.
in
the
first
contribution
make
,
it
be
state
"
that
such
a
ban
product
would
be
use
in
the
first
place
,
be
it
by
accident
or
design
,
be
now
a
subject
of
investigation
.
"
where
do
it
state
that
the
product
which
be
use
in
the
plant
in
Wexford
be
a
ban
product
?
when
,
at
a
previous
hearing
on
this
matter
,
I
ask
the
Secretary
General
of
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
whether
it
be
a
ban
product
,
I
could
not
get
a
straight
answer
.
he
tell
I
the
plant
concerned
should
have
be
the
subject
of
haccp
legislation
and
should
have
be
notify
as
to
the
type
of
product
be
use
in
the
process
.
nobody
have
be
able
to
clarify
whether
the
use
of
such
oil
be
cover
by
a
regulation
in
the
first
instance
and
my
layman
's
view
be
that
it
be
not
cover
by
a
regulation
.
perhaps
Mr.
Ahern
could
clarify
he
point
in
that
regard
.
I
seek
Mr.
Ahern
's
view
on
this
.
in
he
submission
he
speak
about
this
happen
after
the
fact
,
in
essence
.
we
be
try
to
achieve
a
enhance
regime
that
would
prevent
any
type
of
incineration
or
the
need
for
such
incidence
because
the
regulatory
regime
would
be
sacrosanct
in
the
first
instance
and
would
apply
to
all
of
the
stakeholder
who
be
food
producer
or
fpo
.
it
would
not
even
need
to
get
to
a
point
of
incineration
.
it
be
easy
to
cite
example
like
the
Belgian
dioxin
scare
and
the
recent
food
scare
to
promote
incineration
here
.
I
question
the
necessity
for
this
submission
.
unless
Mr.
Ahern
can
tell
we
how
we
could
effect
a
proper
regulatory
regime
that
ensure
this
do
not
happen
again
—
from
the
outset
of
a
process
in
term
of
food
production
and
not
after
the
fact
—
frankly
,
we
be
waste
we
time
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
we
guest
state
that
they
be
signatory
to
the
Stockholm
Convention
and
refer
to
pcb
oil
be
phase
out
.
be
that
a
bind
or
non-binding
legal
arrangement
?
one
could
be
a
stakeholder
sign
up
to
a
non-binding
arrangement
.
however
,
unless
this
be
support
by
a
legal
provision
,
one
will
get
nowhere
.
I
be
try
to
establish
whether
the
substance
involve
in
this
case
be
,
in
the
context
of
the
facility
in
question
,
a
ban
or
illegal
substance
.
I
have
not
be
able
to
clarify
the
position
in
that
regard
.
perhaps
Ms
Keaney
might
enlighten
I
.
on
a
point
of
clarification
,
we
be
not
Luddite
in
this
committee
;
we
be
fairly
open
-
minded
in
we
approach
to
this
matter
.
as
a
layman
I
realise
that
we
cannot
keep
bury
waste
.
it
be
just
not
feasible
.
I
wish
to
pick
up
on
what
Senator
Boyle
state
.
it
leave
I
a
little
confused
as
to
the
government
policy
on
the
incineration
of
waste
.
I
hope
someone
can
clarify
it
for
I
.
if
I
interpret
Senator
Boyle
's
statement
correctly
,
then
the
MBT
process
be
the
only
process
in
town
and
not
the
waste
to
incineration
or
waste
to
energy
incineration
as
envisage
by
Indaver
Ireland
and
other
such
company
.
what
be
the
government
position
?
I
suspect
Senator
Boyle
's
comment
be
inform
by
the
fact
that
there
be
a
proposal
for
Ringaskiddy
,
which
be
in
he
constituency
,
and
perhaps
he
be
play
a
little
to
the
gallery
in
that
respect
.
I
refer
to
a
specific
comment
about
the
dioxin
.
this
be
a
process
of
education
for
I
.
can
the
dioxin
be
contain
within
the
facility
in
a
safe
manner
?
in
the
mind
of
the
public
,
the
word
"
dioxin
"
be
both
emotive
and
potent
,
conjure
up
all
sort
of
image
.
I
take
the
point
make
by
the
delegation
that
we
ingest
or
consume
dioxin
or
be
expose
to
they
in
we
everyday
life
and
this
be
not
dispute
.
however
,
can
a
high
concentration
of
dioxin
be
produce
in
a
very
specific
geographical
confine
,
for
instance
,
20000
tonne
per
annum
in
County
Meath
,
be
contain
on
site
or
store
under
rigorous
condition
?
if
such
question
be
answer
this
will
ease
the
public
mind
in
some
respect
.
to
return
to
my
essential
point
about
the
context
of
the
submission
and
the
pork
crisis
,
I
think
this
submission
should
be
make
in
another
context
.
we
will
include
that
as
part
of
we
work
programme
.
I
thank
the
delegate
for
attend
the
meeting
,
for
they
comprehensive
presentation
and
for
answer
member
's
question
.

comprehensive

for

member
's
question
.
I
join
in
welcoming
all
the
contributor
.
Mr.
Cotter
say
8
%
of
world
production
be
trade
so
that
supply
and
demand
swing
can
have
big
effect
on
the
market
.
to
what
extent
,
post
2015
,
will
the
commodity
market
affect
the
Irish
dairy
sector
?
if
we
be
currently
trade
at
€
2.2
billion
,
do
Mr.
Cotter
see
a
significant
variation
in
that
figure
after
2015
or
be
there
,
necessarily
,
a
correlation
between
the
two
?
how
much
of
the
€
2.2
billion
,
which
be
the
dairy
sector
's
contribution
to
food
export
,
filter
down
to
the
primary
producer
?
if
one
compare
price
in
1979
with
current
price
and
consider
the
present
system
of
regulation
,
one
must
accept
that
the
primary
producer
be
a
net
loser
.
how
do
we
develop
a
model
of
agriculture
which
will
deal
with
the
potential
abyss
of
2015
?
what
structure
can
we
put
in
place
to
ensure
that
the
family
farm
can
continue
?
I
would
like
to
hear
the
view
of
the
farming
organisation
on
this
question
.
if
there
be
to
be
great
consolidation
of
the
dairying
sector
in
2015
,
it
follow
that
there
must
be
consolidation
of
farm
holding
.
hundred
of
farm
will
cease
to
exist
and
will
be
consolidate
into
a
new
structure
with
a
small
number
of
large
producer
.
if
there
be
another
possibility
I
would
like
to
hear
it
,
but
that
be
how
I
see
thing
develop
if
we
be
to
compete
with
country
like
New
Zealand
in
the
global
market
.
the
New
Zealand
model
be
not
base
on
the
family
farm
.
the
product
be
sell
into
a
single
milk
market
.
be
that
the
system
we
want
to
see
in
Ireland
and
be
that
where
we
be
go
?
be
there
a
disjoint
between
what
the
co-operative
,
or
plc
,
be
say
and
what
the
primary
producer
be
think
?
if
the
farmer
be
the
price
taker
from
the
co-operative
,
which
he
own
and
in
which
he
have
a
active
stake
,
do
the
farmer
not
control
the
price
?
that
thought
have
occur
to
I
in
the
recent
past
.
there
have
be
much
talk
of
volatility
.
how
do
we
guard
against
it
in
the
abyss
of
2015
?
what
mechanism
can
be
use
to
ensure
the
income
of
family
farm
as
pledge
in
the
Treaty
of
Rome
?
farming
organisation
say
the
future
be
not
bright
.
how
can
politician
ensure
that
a
long
term
view
of
the
future
of
agriculture
be
take
?
I
be
speak
of
a
20
year
and
not
a
two
or
three
year
view
.
I
see
the
point
Mr.
Cahill
be
make
about
reduce
quota
in
term
of
guarantee
a
price
for
the
present
,
but
be
that
sustainable
in
the
long
term
?
a
farmer
might
derive
a
increase
in
price
per
litre
now
if
there
be
a
reduction
in
quota
,
but
what
be
the
scenario
for
the
same
farmer
in
2015
?
that
be
the
question
I
be
try
to
grapple
with
in
term
of
how
we
take
political
responsibility
for
what
need
to
happen
in
agriculture
in
the
future
and
how
we
can
maintain
the
comparative
advantage
in
term
of
production
.
I
could
go
on
but
I
do
not
want
to
hog
the
meeting
.
I
thank
they
for
come
,
they
comprehensive
presentation
and
answer
member
's
question
.
I
welcome
the
minister
and
he
official
and
thank
they
for
attend
.
have
people
be
personally
search
under
section
17a
?
have
that
provision
be
exercise
in
that
fashion
?
who
be
the
authorise
officer
?
do
that
authorise
officer
have
the
power
to
bring
in
the
Army
to
cull
herd
?
if
so
,
have
that
provision
be
use
?
under
what
condition
would
a
person
be
search
pursuant
to
section
17a
?
I
be
uncomfortable
about
this
issue
,
due
to
the
rights
of
the
person
.
I
would
like
to
get
more
information
on
it
and
how
it
have
be
use
.
we
be
be
ask
to
extend
the
provision
under
section
17a
for
a
further
12
month
from
8
March
under
the
animal
health
and
welfare
Bill
.
be
it
fair
to
say
that
the
Bill
may
take
as
long
as
that
to
come
before
this
house
?
the
Bill
be
on
the
legislative
programme
since
this
government
's
mandate
begin
.
if
the
government
be
repeal
act
that
be
over
100
year
old
in
some
case
,
then
I
understand
that
such
a
cumbersome
process
will
take
time
.
however
,
as
we
be
well
into
the
mandate
of
this
government
,
when
will
this
Bill
be
before
we
?
it
seem
that
the
clock
be
tick
and
I
do
not
understand
how
it
have
not
be
bring
before
the
House
by
now
.
if
there
be
reason
for
the
failure
to
introduce
this
Bill
,
I
would
like
to
know
they
.
I
broadly
support
the
measure
to
provide
for
the
extension
,
subject
to
clarification
on
the
power
of
authorise
officer
to
search
person
.
I
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
if
we
be
a
food
-
export
nation
,
then
the
eradication
of
disease
be
paramount
to
ensure
we
comparative
advantage
.
I
be
concerned
also
about
the
power
that
be
propose
within
the
animal
health
and
welfare
Bill
.
the
minister
refer
in
he
statement
to
provision
to
make
regulation
cover
a
range
of
issue
.
I
would
like
to
know
what
that
issue
be
.
I
understand
what
the
minister
say
about
the
eradication
of
disease
and
he
refer
to
specific
disease
.
within
the
remit
of
the
legislation
will
the
minister
also
extend
that
power
to
cover
issue
such
as
puppy
farming
and
badger
baiting
?
will
all
of
that
issue
be
encompass
within
the
legislation
?
we
have
be
lobby
extensively
by
animal
welfare
group
seek
to
ban
certain
practice
and
it
be
difficult
to
know
how
to
respond
to
they
as
we
do
not
know
what
exactly
the
legislation
will
contain
.
we
be
in
a
vacuum
in
that
sense
.
I
understand
that
it
take
time
to
codify
or
consolidate
legislation
because
it
be
a
cumbersome
process
.
however
,
the
minister
must
act
with
more
proficiency
to
bring
the
legislation
forward
so
that
we
know
exactly
what
we
be
deal
with
in
regard
to
all
of
that
issue
.
on
a
point
of
order
—
—
in
term
of
the
question
I
ask
and
with
respect
to
the
minister
,
the
answer
be
not
adequate
.
he
be
ask
we
to
extend
the
timeline
of
section
17a
.
it
be
fair
and
responsible
of
we
to
ask
on
behalf
of
the
people
under
what
circumstance
have
the
power
be
use
,
in
particular
,
whether
they
have
be
use
with
regard
to
the
searching
of
person
.
it
be
reasonable
for
I
to
ask
this
question
and
the
minister
should
not
obfuscate
on
the
issue
.
I
understand
why
the
provision
be
in
place
and
I
be
not
against
it
necessarily
.
however
,
I
would
like
further
information
on
whether
it
have
be
use
to
search
individual
.
I
would
have
a
problem
with
this
and
would
like
a
more
detailed
answer
from
the
minister
.
with
all
due
respect
,
we
be
entitle
to
it
.

I
welcome
the
organisation
here
today
.
my
question
be
quite
specific
.
where
be
the
scientific
assumption
underlie
the
preservation
of
cod
stock
come
from
?
do
both
organisation
agree
with
that
assumption
?
do
they
agree
that
the
Council
regulation
put
in
place
for
the
preservation
of
cod
stock
represent
the
right
way
to
go
for
a
sustainable
industry
?
do
the
witness
feel
that
the
green
paper
on
the
common
Fishery
Policy
will
present
a
real
political
opportunity
to
overhaul
that
policy
?
do
they
think
that
it
will
come
down
to
the
same
,
last
minute
EU
Council
negotiation
and
will
pan
out
in
a
beggar
thy
neighbour
process
?
we
always
talk
about
what
a
great
resource
fishery
could
be
,
but
if
this
green
paper
be
to
mean
anything
,
there
will
have
to
be
real
political
change
.
do
the
witness
think
there
will
be
real
political
change
to
bring
about
the
type
of
industry
they
want
to
see
?
Mr.
Maddock
state
that
the
IFO
be
totally
oppose
to
the
new
regime
because
it
be
design
to
split
fisherman
,
will
increase
the
value
of
some
licence
and
make
a
number
of
licence
worthless
.
can
he
clarify
what
he
mean
?
I
be
still
a
little
bit
at
sea
—
pardon
the
pun
—
in
term
of
my
understanding
of
the
assumption
govern
the
regulation
on
the
limit
of
kilowatt
per
day
in
the
Celtic
Sea
.
can
somebody
elaborate
on
that
for
I
?
be
it
possible
to
quantify
how
many
boat
will
be
adversely
affect
as
a
result
of
the
restriction
on
mesh
size
?
when
he
speak
about
net
size
,
Mr.
Ó
Cinnéide
state
that
the
other
stock
be
in
a
relatively
healthy
state
.
can
he
elaborate
on
that
?
how
many
vessel
?
be
it
agree
that
the
clerk
of
the
committee
will
inform
the
minister
and
he
official
about
the
debate
that
take
place
here
today
?
agree
.
I
thank
the
Federation
of
Irish
Fishermen
and
the
Irish
Fishermen
's
Organisation
for
they
comprehensive
presentation
and
for
answer
the
question
raise
here
today
.

I
thank
the
Federation
of

Fishermen
and
the
Irish
Fishermen
's
Organisation
for
they
comprehensive
presentation
and
for
answer
the
question
raise
here
today
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
to
the
committee
.
most
of
my
question
have
already
be
cover
by
deputy
Sheahan
so
there
be
no
point
in
my
repeat
they
.
however
,
I
be
interested
in
the
statement
make
by
Commissioner
Borg
to
the
fishery
committee
of
the
European
Parliament
on
10
February
that
the
Hague
preference
would
be
open
for
negotiation
.
in
term
of
fishery
policy
,
it
seem
the
Irish
voice
at
the
European
Council
be
weak
to
begin
with
and
we
have
be
on
the
back
foot
ever
since
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
sense
from
the
Minister
of
State
of
whether
,
with
the
review
which
be
to
take
place
in
2012
,
there
will
be
a
strengthening
of
Irish
fishery
and
they
economic
potential
,
or
whether
it
will
be
the
usual
negotiation
for
the
low
common
denominator
.
be
there
potential
for
growth
in
real
term
?
I
would
also
like
to
hear
the
Minister
of
State
speak
more
about
the
potential
for
aquaculture
.
have
read
the
report
about
the
seminar
that
take
place
in
Kenmare
on
19
March
,
I
can
see
there
be
massive
potential
for
job
growth
in
this
sector
.
I
would
like
to
hear
how
that
would
be
bring
about
in
real
term
.
in
term
of
marketing
initiative
,
I
can
see
how
the
European
Seafood
Exposition
could
yield
result
,
but
such
initiative
have
be
ongoing
for
year
.
BIM
have
be
strong
in
term
of
market
Irish
fishing
,
but
there
seem
to
be
a
status
quo
.
be
there
new
initiative
which
will
seek
to
corner
a
great
percentage
of
the
export
market
from
the
point
of
view
of
aquaculture
and
sea-fishery
?
with
regard
to
the
percentage
share
hold
by
each
member
state
,
the
minister
state
they
have
generally
remain
the
same
for
more
than
20
year
under
the
principle
of
relative
stability
.
I
do
not
know
exactly
what
this
principle
mean
,
although
I
have
a
idea
of
what
it
might
mean
,
but
perhaps
the
minister
of
State
could
discuss
that
further
.
the
Minister
of
State
do
not
refer
to
the
future
of
eel
fishing
in
he
statement
.
I
would
like
he
to
elaborate
on
this
.
be
there
a
future
for
eel
fishing
in
this
country
?
be
it
come
under
threat
at
present
?
what
be
the
minister
of
State
's
view
?
on
behalf
of
the
joint
committee
,
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
and
he
official
for
attend
.
I
thank
he
for
he
comprehensive
presentation
and
answer
question
.
I
be
glad
he
have
indicate
that
he
will
come
back
to
we
if
there
be
further
news
.
it
be
great
to
see
he
back
in
full
fettle
after
he
recent
illness
.
how
will
the
inspection
regime
work
in
practice
?
if
I
be
a
farmer
,
would
I
be
visit
by
the
environment
section
of
the
local
authority
,
such
as
Cork
County
Council
,
by
a
EPA
inspector
,
and
by
a
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
inspector
,
all
of
whom
would
inspect
what
I
do
in
term
of
the
provision
in
the
directive
?
also
,
who
have
primacy
on
the
issue
—
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
or
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
?
how
be
it
envision
the
action
programme
will
be
devise
and
how
will
they
work
in
practice
?
will
they
be
base
on
information
garner
from
individual
inspection
?
it
be
difficult
to
understand
how
the
provision
can
be
implement
,
to
be
honest
.
what
will
be
the
cost
to
the
Exchequer
of
they
implementation
?
will
the
cost
be
borne
by
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
or
by
the
local
authority
?
if
local
authority
will
bear
the
cost
,
will
they
need
to
redeploy
exist
staff
to
carry
out
the
inspection
,
give
that
there
be
a
embargo
on
local
authority
's
take
on
new
staff
?
I
be
not
a
scientist
but
a
layman
in
this
respect
,
but
the
objective
of
the
nitrate
directive
be
to
reduce
water
pollution
cause
by
nitrate
and
phosphorus
from
agricultural
source
and
to
prevent
further
such
pollution
.
do
it
deal
only
with
phosphorus
from
agricultural
source
or
do
it
also
deal
with
other
source
?
the
witness
mention
the
dangerous
substance
directive
.
be
he
say
pollution
cause
by
phosphorus
come
primarily
from
agricultural
source
or
be
other
dangerous
substance
encompass
within
the
ECJ
judgment
?
I
represent
Cork
East
and
the
town
of
Mallow
and
Fermoy
be
within
my
constituency
.
Mallow
be
my
home
town
.
the
wastewater
treatment
plant
there
be
woefully
inadequate
and
will
not
meet
the
need
of
a
town
of
that
size
.
my
understanding
be
that
it
have
no
phosphorus
control
or
removal
facility
,
but
I
ask
the
witness
to
clarify
that
.
what
be
spend
on
phosphorus
removal
facility
?
what
percentage
of
wastewater
treatment
plant
and
sewage
treatment
plant
do
not
have
that
facility
?
I
return
to
my
early
question
about
the
preparation
and
publication
of
the
action
programme
.
the
regulation
state
that
the
minister
shall
"
prepare
and
publish
not
late
than
30
June
2010
and
every
four
year
thereafter
,
a
programme
of
measure
[...]
for
the
protection
of
water
against
pollution
from
agriculture
"
.
what
measure
be
be
take
to
prevent
pollution
from
source
other
than
agriculture
?
do
they
also
fall
within
the
remit
of
the
dangerous
substance
directive
?
it
seem
that
this
duplication
of
effort
will
actually
end
up
cost
the
Exchequer
a
lot
more
through
the
expending
of
resource
and
it
will
place
a
increase
burden
on
that
who
be
involved
in
agricultural
production
.
I
fail
to
see
how
the
Department
will
be
able
to
implement
this
regulation
without
expend
massive
resource
and
I
ask
for
a
comment
.
what
be
the
basis
of
the
ECJ
ruling
,
then
,
if
the
Department
have
be
carry
out
inspection
since
2005
?
it
be
important
to
give
time
to
the
subject
.
I
refer
to
the
inspection
regime
.
the
statutory
instrument
confer
fairly
extensive
power
on
the
Garda
,
local
authority
and
statutory
body
in
term
of
enter
a
farm
for
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
.
Mr.
Allen
state
that
approximately
3200
inspection
be
carry
out
since
2005
—
—
in
light
of
the
regulation
which
have
be
in
place
since
31
March
how
many
inspection
do
the
delegation
envisage
will
be
carry
out
?
who
will
have
the
primary
objective
in
this
regard
?
will
it
be
the
local
authority
,
the
EPA
or
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
?
if
it
be
to
be
a
local
authority
,
will
it
be
grant
increase
resource
to
enable
it
to
do
this
work
and
,
if
so
,
what
figure
have
be
put
aside
for
this
purpose
?
I
be
try
to
get
at
the
cost
to
the
Exchequer
as
a
result
of
this
statutory
instrument
in
term
of
a
inspection
regime
.
will
it
ultimately
lead
to
improve
water
quality
?
if
I
return
to
the
distinction
Mr.
Duggan
make
between
the
urban
wastewater
treatment
directive
and
the
dangerous
substance
directive
,
and
take
the
improvement
make
in
agricultural
practice
,
the
Department
,
through
lack
of
resource
provide
for
local
authority
,
be
the
main
culprit
in
low
water
quality
.
that
be
the
central
point
.
I
do
not
understand
why
we
be
add
another
layer
of
bureaucracy
when
we
should
streamline
the
bureaucratic
function
.
I
would
like
to
know
the
specifics
on
the
inspection
regime
,
how
many
will
be
carry
out
over
the
next
12
month
,
by
whom
and
at
what
cost
to
the
Exchequer
.
I
would
like
very
specific
answer
.
if
the
witness
cannot
answer
that
question
today
perhaps
they
could
revert
to
I
.
on
behalf
of
the
joint
committee
,
I

who
be
a
party
to
the
historical
negotiation
that
bring
about
a
scenario
which
would
see
the
abolition
of
quota
in
2015
?
who
be
the
ultimate
decider
of
that
?
ultimately
,
be
it
a
decision
of
the
Council
of
Minister
or
of
Commissioner
Fischer
Boel
?
if
it
be
a
decision
of
the
Council
of
Minister
,
be
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
a
party
to
that
negotiation
?
we
be
be
tell
that
the
capital
investment
be
in
the
order
of
€
286
million
at
full
production
.
may
I
have
a
breakdown
of
that
figure
and
how
that
be
disburse
throughout
the
industry
?
be
it
disburse
primarily
into
the
co-operative
movement
or
to
primary
producer
?
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
of
where
we
will
be
post
-2015
.
the
current
scenario
do
not
augur
well
because
global
market
price
have
collapse
and
farmer
be
produce
at
below
cost
.
it
seem
that
in
a
post
-2015
scenario
with
the
abolition
of
quota
one
will
be
leave
very
much
to
the
vagary
of
the
market
.
if
the
global
market
at
that
point
be
in
a
poor
state
,
I
fear
there
will
be
a
massive
reduction
in
the
production
from
small
producer
here
because
they
will
not
enjoy
the
economy
of
scale
to
compete
at
global
market
price
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
of
where
the
debate
be
now
,
because
Commissioner
Fischer
Boel
will
not
be
in
that
position
in
2015
and
there
may
be
a
new
regime
here
at
that
stage
as
well
.
the
question
remain
on
every
farmer
's
lip
be
,
will
he
be
able
to
produce
milk
competitively
and
will
he
derive
a
income
at
that
time
.
I
suspect
there
will
be
a
massive
reduction
in
milk
production
from
small
producer
who
will
not
be
able
to
compete
.
there
will
be
a
pyramid
where
there
will
be
a
small
number
of
large
producer
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
of
whether
that
be
the
ultimate
aim
or
whether
that
be
a
policy
provision
of
Commissioner
Fischer
Boel
,
the
commission
,
or
the
Council
of
Minister
.
I
refer
to
the
issue
of
commodification
of
agriculture
.
a
large
part
of
the
morass
in
which
we
find
ourselves
be
cause
by
how
milk
-
derive
product
have
be
use
as
commodity
on
global
market
.
I
wonder
whether
there
be
a
view
emerge
that
,
for
want
of
a
good
expression
,
decoupl
commodity
from
the
production
process
would
stabilise
market
and
allow
farmer
to
retain
a
foothold
in
the
market
.
I
do
not
have
a
firm
view
on
it
,
but
I
want
to
know
how
the
commodity
market
have
affect
the
price
of
milk
or
milk
derive
product
.
it
be
important
to
factor
that
into
the
process
.
I
understand
a
cumulative
increase
of
9.2
%
in
quota
lead
up
to
2014
be
be
sell
as
a
assistance
to
farmer
.
if
ours
be
a
grass
-
base
system
and
if
there
be
a
view
emerge
within
the
Green
movement
that
there
should
be
taxation
on
carbon
,
or
potentially
on
methane
,
I
wonder
how
that
will
affect
grass
-
base
agriculture
in
future
and
whether
it
will
mitigate
the
income
effect
on
farmer
in
2014
.
I
wonder
what
kind
of
economic
modelling
have
be
put
into
effect
for
the
post
-2015
period
because
analysis
be
hard
to
come
by
at
present
.
I
fear
that
large
farmer
will
survive
the
2015
scenario
but
small
producer
will
have
to
sell
-
up
to
a
large
producer
,
and
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
analyse
.
my
question
about
the
9
%
increase
in
quota
up
to
2014
have
not
be
answer
.
if
carbon
-
base
tax
be
introduce
at
EU
or
Irish
level
,
will
they
be
offset
against
income
that
may
be
earn
by
the
increase
in
methane
and
grass
-
base
production
?
I
suggest
this
theoretical
question
need
to
be
address
.
I
seek
clarification
,
for
my
own
information
,
of
what
deputy
O'Keeffe
say
.
be
he
suggest
milk
be
be
produce
competitively
in
Argentina
for
9
cent
a
litre
?

on

I

the
Secretary

and
he
official
for
attend
today
's
meeting
.
I
be
delighted
the
witness
be
here
today
because
this
represent
a
golden
opportunity
for
the
committee
to
have
some
degree
of
analysis
on
what
have
be
go
on
within
the
retail
food
sector
in
recent
month
in
particular
.
when
I
think
of
what
happen
at
the
time
of
the
May
bank
holiday
weekend
with
regard
to
Tesco
my
strong
feeling
be
that
it
pull
off
the
great
stroke
that
be
ever
pull
off
in
the
retail
food
sector
.
it
dress
up
a
design
plan
to
extract
as
many
Irish
product
and
goods
from
the
planogram
in
they
store
as
a
mechanism
to
reduce
price
to
the
consumer
.
if
one
listen
to
the
testimonial
of
shopper
come
from
the
store
after
that
weekend
it
be
brand
as
a
triumph
for
the
consumer
in
reduce
price
and
that
the
consumer
be
win
as
a
result
.
in
a
very
small
area
.
however
,
when
one
dig
a
little
deep
one
realise
that
Irish
household
name
brand
and
product
be
extract
from
the
shelf
.
this
include
Batchelor
,
Lyons
Tea
,
Barry
's
Tea
,
Dubliner
cheese
and
Tayto
,
which
be
squeeze
out
of
the
space
they
have
hold
heretofore
.
I
fear
that
Tesco
aim
at
the
creation
of
what
I
can
only
describe
as
a
"
tescopoly
"
.
it
now
have
26
%
of
the
market
and
be
reach
for
more
.
rather
than
carry
more
Irish
product
,
its
store
will
sell
a
wide
array
of
own
brand
,
import
and
arguably
inferior
goods
.
this
insidious
practice
need
to
be
stop
.
I
be
glad
the
witness
have
come
up
with
a
concrete
set
of
proposal
.
Rational
debate
be
require
on
food
margin
because
since
the
introduction
of
the
euro
,
Irish
consumer
can
easily
compare
the
price
of
a
basket
of
goods
in
Spain
,
for
example
,
with
similar
product
in
Ireland
.
it
be
easy
to
argue
that
Irish
producer
be
add
the
margin
that
create
significant
price
difference
,
whereas
they
be
determine
by
the
large
multiple
which
have
such
control
of
the
market
that
they
be
stealthily
squeeze
out
Irish
producer
.
it
be
a
dangerous
strategy
with
serious
implication
for
job
creation
in
the
future
.
a
document
launch
yesterday
by
IBEC
and
the
food
and
drink
Industry
of
Ireland
note
that
the
cost
input
of
food
production
in
Ireland
be
significantly
high
than
in
other
European
country
.
Mr.
Power
make
a
similar
point
in
he
contribution
.
how
do
we
address
the
issue
of
margin
?
how
can
we
put
in
place
a
legislative
framework
that
allow
the
primary
producer
and
retailer
to
take
they
cut
while
allow
the
consumer
to
pay
a
price
which
be
similar
to
elsewhere
in
Europe
?
reinstate
the
grocery
order
or
review
the
role
of
the
Competition
Authority
may
offer
way
of
achieve
that
goal
.
fair
trade
legislation
be
also
a
option
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
witness
's
view
on
how
such
legislation
could
be
implement
to
ensure
a
level
playing
field
for
retailer
,
consumer
and
primary
producer
.
regard
Tesco'
sourcing
of
foodstuff
from
abroad
,
and
the
UK
in
particular
,
what
would
happen
if
the
other
multiple
follow
suit
?
Ms
Campbell
refer
to
Aldi's
apparently
healthy
relationship
with
Irish
producer
.
be
it
possible
to
estimate
the
number
of
potential
job
loss
and
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
a
supermarket
price
war
on
the
Irish
market
?
the
grocery
sector
have
be
extremely
expose
to
currency
fluctuation
between
the
euro
and
sterling
.
I
be
try
to
assess
the
impact
on
Tesco
's
price
if
sterling
appreciate
.
in
regard
to
the
announcement
over
the
bank
holiday
weekend
on
dramatically
reduce
price
for
the
UK
basket
of
goods
,
I
believe
this
price
will
increase
over
the
long
term
and
Irish
consumer
will
end
up
pay
more
than
they
have
heretofore
.
what
be
the
witness
's
view
on
the
relationship
between
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
and
Enterprise
,
trade
and
employment
?
the
former
Department
's
announcement
of
€
641
million
for
agri-food
research
programme
seem
disconnect
from
the
latter
's
policy
for
job
creation
in
the
sector
.
my
impression
be
that
a
cross
-
departmental
approach
be
not
be
take
.
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
deal
with
farmer
,
the
co-operative
movement
and
the
European
Union
but
it
do
not
appear
to
have
a
input
into
the
role
of
the
retail
sector
in
agricultural
policy
.
my
awareness
of
the
potential
for
growth
in
the
food
industry
be
enhance
by
the
document
Mr.
Powers
produce
for
Agri-Aware
.
if
this
committee
be
to
influence
the
retail
sector
,
it
will
have
to
develop
a
concrete
set
of
proposal
that
can
be
present
to
the
government
.
starting
with
deputy
O'Sullivan
's
point
,
I
do
not
believe
it
be
necessarily
a
case
of
get
rid
of
the
multiple
rather
one
of
level
the
playing
pitch
concern
the
margin
ascertain
between
the
producer
and
the
retailer
.
that
must
be
borne
in
mind
.
I
do
not
advocate
the
abolition
of
the
multiple
.
they
be
necessary
and
have
a
place
within
the
market
.
I
refer
to
a
point
raise
by
Ms
Campbell
on
the
effect
on
small
town
and
the
increase
consolidation
of
the
retail
sector
.
she
refer
to
the
high
court
decision
on
the
Kerry
Group
's
acquisition
vis-à
-
vis
Dairygold
.
there
seem
to
be
a
contradiction
between
the
consolidation
of
the
co-operative
or
dairy
sector
and
the
need
for
local
food
market
.
we
be
tell
the
abolition
of
milk
quota
will
take
place
in
2015
and
producer
will
then
be
part
of
a
global
,
competitive
market
because
many
of
the
price
support
will
no
long
remain
in
the
dairy
industry
.
the
net
consequence
will
be
a
increase
and
even
further
consolidation
of
the
co-operative
movement
and
processing
.
therefore
,
the
brand
we
all
know
and
love
will
probably
be
own
by
one
or
two
player
in
the
market
.
that
model
compare
with
the
situation
in
north
Cork
,
for
example
,
in
which
the
new
market
co-operative
movement
have
begin
.
it
be
a
small
niche
model
with
high
end
product
that
compete
quite
well
.
at
question
be
how
to
marry
the
two
model
and
strike
a
balance
between
the
local
need
and
the
ability
of
Ireland
incorporate
to
compete
in
a
global
market
post
2015
.
politically
,
the
subsidisation
of
agriculture
by
the
European
Union
will
diminish
in
the
next
20
year
or
so
,
because
the
WTO
will
probably
influence
outcome
in
that
regard
.
what
be
the
perfect
model
,
if
there
be
such
a
thing
,
in
term
of
how
to
increase
export
and
at
the
same
time
marry
that
goal
to
the
need
of
develop
retail
within
the
high
street
?
currently
,
property
rights
be
so
entrenched
in
the
county
that
if
a
local
authority
seek
to
tackle
dereliction
or
a
board
up
shop
in
a
town
centre
,
it
could
not
do
so
because
it
would
be
drag
through
the
court
.
the
rights
of
the
property
owner
outweigh
that
of
the
common
good
in
term
of
a
main
street
property
and
they
supersede
the
right
of
the
town
in
term
of
its
enhancement
of
the
town
centre
.
I
trust
the
delegation
understand
the
point
I
be
try
to
make
.
there
must
be
a
fundamental
re-shaping
of
this
position
.
I
have
be
a
member
of
a
local
authority
and
I
have
witness
what
happen
to
land
adjoin
a
town
centre
in
which
the
so
-
call
"
donut
effect
"
be
create
.
it
be
a
consequence
of
the
need
to
attract
the
big
retailer
to
get
increase
footfall
in
a
give
town
.
unless
a
local
authority
can
provide
parking
,
change
the
fundamental
property
rights
of
people
within
town
centre
or
it
have
the
ability
to
impose
a
cpo
,
compulsory
purchase
order
,
on
derelict
land
then
that
policy
will
never
change
.
what
be
the
view
of
the
delegation
?
they
will
come
before
the
committee
.
they
will
come
before
the
committee
.
they
will
come
before
the
committee
.
I
be
sorry
to
interject
.
the
Communication
(
retention
of
data
)
Bill
be
before
the
Dáil
.
I
apologise
because
I
be
speak
on
the
Bill
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
I
thank
Ms
Kehoe
and
Mr.
Ronan
for
they
presentation
and
for
answer
question
.
I
welcome
Mr.
Gunning
and
Mr.
Egan
to
the
meeting
.
my
first
question
relate
to
the
target
of
planting
15000
hectare
,
which
,
if
government
policy
be
be
implement
,
should
be
achieve
every
year
.
why
have
that
target
not
be
reach
?
what
be
Coillte
's
response
to
the
failure
to
do
so
if
that
be
the
supposedly
sustainable
target
for
the
country
per
annum
?
COFORD
's
research
indicate
that
if
15000
hectare
be
plant
per
year
,
490
job
would
be
create
to
manage
,
harvest
and
process
the
timber
.
if
the
target
be
not
reach
,
what
influence
have
Coillte
in
the
failure
to
do
so
?
I
refer
to
by
-
product
.
have
we
still
be
in
a
boom
,
Coillte
's
profit
for
2008
would
be
significantly
good
and
they
would
not
have
reduce
by
77
%
.
have
the
organisation
hedge
too
much
of
its
resource
in
the
construction
industry
and
not
enough
in
the
bio-fuel
sector
,
give
the
renewable
target
that
must
be
meet
by
2020
?
accord
to
its
annual
report
,
Coillte
be
a
long
way
from
meet
this
target
such
as
12
%
renewable
heat
by
2020
and
5
%
by
2010
.
I
accept
that
be
national
target
and
Coillte
do
not
have
responsibility
for
the
country
in
this
regard
.
however
,
in
the
context
of
its
product
mix
,
the
organisation
have
massive
potential
to
exploit
alternative
energy
source
.
it
have
not
operate
at
its
potential
for
the
past
number
of
year
to
reach
the
target
or
to
maximise
profit
.
Mr.
Gunning
mention
the
projection
for
the
annual
report
due
in
April
2010
.
will
the
organisation
operate
at
a
loss
for
2009
or
will
it
still
make
a
profit
?
will
the
downturn
in
the
construction
industry
be
reflect
in
the
return
for
this
year
in
the
annual
report
?
the
most
important
issue
be
the
rate
of
afforestation
.
the
output
for
2009
will
represent
1
%
of
gdp
,
accord
to
COFORD
.
the
forestry
sector
be
underperfor
and
perhaps
there
be
too
much
hedge
in
the
expansion
of
the
construction
industry
.
while
Mr.
Gunning
refer
to
the
two
ancillary
company
and
Coillte
have
to
enter
that
market
,
nobody
could
predict
the
rate
of
the
crash
and
,
therefore
,
the
impact
on
the
organisation
's
project
.
should
it
have
a
wide
product
mix
and
refer
more
to
the
renewable
sector
?
this
sector
will
be
the
jewel
in
the
organisation
's
crown
in
the
future
and
perhaps
more
should
have
be
do
in
this
regard
over
the
past
two
year
.
while
I
be
a
layman
and
not
a
businessman
,
there
be
legitimate
question
about
this
in
the
semi-State
sector
.
I
be
a
absolute
believer
in
Coillte
's
recreation
policy
because
I
have
first
-
hand
experience
of
the
product
it
deliver
,
particularly
in
north
Cork
and
the
Ballyhoura
Mountain
.
it
be
a
fantastic
product
and
I
wish
Coillte
well
with
that
.
Coillte
have
underperform
in
the
renewable
sector
.
will
the
delegate
comment
on
that
?
perhaps
the
delegation
can
explain
something
to
I
with
regard
to
sequester
carbon
and
the
pre-1990
target
.
what
be
the
potential
for
Coillte
for
offset
carbon
?
currently
,
must
we
rely
on
pre-1990
forestry
growth
rate
in
order
to
be
include
for
offset
?
if
we
continue
grow
more
tree
,
can
we
offset
we
co2
emission
and
can
that
offset
be
use
in
the
accounting
in
term
of
reach
we
goal
,
for
example
the
post
-
Copenhagen
goal
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
will
Coillte
have
a
great
role
to
play
?
the
afforestation
goal
be
approximately
300000
hectare
per
annum
over
the
next
two
decade
and
Forestry
2030
have
a
target
of
approximately
1
million
hectare
by
2030
.
be
that
a
achievable
or
realistic
target
?
give
the
product
mix
and
corporate
strategy
be
adopt
by
Coillte
and
give
it
have
a
virtual
monopoly
in
the
area
,
will
we
reach
that
target
by
then
?
if
afforestation
be
be
use
for
carbon
sequestration
purpose
,
will
cut
not
have
a
affect
in
the
sense
that
it
increase
co2
emission
?

I

Gunning

's

in

differ

the
future
of
the
breed
.
in
regard
to
the
legal
position
,
Mr.
Keely
have
state
that
the
previous
director
declare
the
EGM
invalid
on
the
basis
of
allegation
of
forgery
in
the
requisition
of
document
.
Ms
Loughnane
,
however
,
state
:
follow
postponement
and
fail
mediation
effort
,
the
case
be
due
to
be
hear
in
the
high
Court
on
4
April
2008
.
on
that
day
,
the
former
director
accept
in
full
the
validity
of
the
meeting
and
that
the
resolution
pass
a
year
early
on
31
March
2007
be
bind
from
that
date
.
as
I
be
try
to
reconcile
the
date
to
my
satisfaction
,
perhaps
Ms
Loughnane
will
outline
the
course
of
event
and
Mr.
Cooke
will
describe
the
nature
of
the
complaint
.
it
be
clear
that
both
organisation
be
passionate
about
the
breed
.
the
involvement
of
Horse
Sport
Ireland
do
not
sit
well
with
I
.
if
the
Connemara
Pony
Breeders
Society
and
the
Irish
Cob
Society
can
control
they
own
stud
book
,
it
be
ludicrous
that
the
Irish
Draught
Horse
Society
,
if
that
be
to
be
the
legal
entity
,
cannot
have
control
of
the
breed
's
stud
book
.
what
sort
of
political
intervention
be
need
to
restore
that
control
?
I
ask
for
the
delegate
's
view
on
the
propose
breeding
policy
for
the
Irish
draught
horse
and
why
such
proposal
be
only
now
come
into
the
public
domain
.
the
policy
's
objective
be
:
"
to
breed
Irish
draught
horse
with
good
conformation
,
movement
and
temperament
that
conform
to
the
breed
standard
,
which
will
make
good
quality
,
sound
,
versatile
horse
and
be
a
foundation
breed
that
,
when
cross
with
other
breed
,
will
produce
performance
horse
.
"
as
I
be
a
layman
,
perhaps
somebody
can
explain
what
this
mean
.
I
suggest
it
represent
a
continuation
of
the
exist
policy
,
which
could
lead
to
further
dilution
of
the
breed
.
if
one
or
other
of
the
organisation
before
we
control
the
stud
book
,
would
it
be
possible
to
ensure
that
the
sport
horse
can
flourish
even
while
the
draught
horse
be
preserve
in
its
pure
form
?
the
two
objective
be
not
mutually
exclusive
.
if
we
recognise
the
legality
of
the
Irish
Draught
Horse
Society
on
the
basis
of
the
various
high
Court
action
that
have
be
take
,
we
would
also
acknowledge
that
it
should
control
it
stud
book
and
that
its
aim
do
not
exclude
Horse
Sport
Ireland
.
what
do
Mr.
Croke
mean
by
"
a
high
-
power
letter
"
?
this
go
to
the
—
—
do
Mr.
Croke
recognise
—
—
while
Mr.
Croke
be
speak
on
this
point
it
be
important
to
be
clear
about
what
be
be
say
.
the
case
be
hear
in
the
high
Court
on
4
April
2008
.
do
Mr.
Croke
recognise
the
validity
of
the
decision
arise
from
the
high
Court
proceedings
?
what
be
the
nature
of
Mr.
Croke
's
assertion
regard
the
forgery
?
I
cannot
reconcile

I
welcome
the
representative
from
Macra
to
Feirme
and
I
thank
they
for
they
cogent
and
well
think
out
presentation
.
Mr.
Gowing
indicate
that
a
grand
total
of
1088
student
throughout
the
country
be
avail
of
high
education
or
further
education
course
provide
by
Teagasc
.
I
have
a
serious
reservation
about
the
recruitment
embargo
and
the
fact
that
that
retire
from
teaching
be
not
be
replace
.
this
will
have
a
seriously
negative
effect
on
the
ability
to
adequately
train
farmer
in
the
future
.
I
agree
wholeheartedly
with
what
have
be
put
forward
by
Macra
to
Feirme
in
this
instance
.
the
committee
should
take
a
strong
position
on
the
issue
.
in
light
of
the
multiplier
effect
to
which
Mr.
Gowing
refer
in
respect
of
input
and
investment
into
the
economy
and
the
qualitative
nature
of
teaching
and
how
it
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
agriculture
sector
,
any
further
loss
within
the
academic
or
teaching
coterie
will
have
a
detrimental
effect
.
in
such
circumstance
,
the
committee
should
take
a
strong
position
and
should
base
this
on
the
figure
provide
by
we
guest
.
I
also
have
reservation
in
respect
of
tax
relief
.
the
time
be
fast
approach
when
"
tax
"
and
"
relief
"
will
be
perceive
as
dirty
word
.
it
will
be
impossible
to
keep
such
relief
at
the
level
to
which
people
have
become
use
.
I
do
not
know
if
it
will
be
possible
to
reintroduce
some
of
the
tax
relief
to
which
Mr.
Gowing
refer
.
I
be
interested
in
the
position
with
regard
to
stamp
duty
relief
.
do
this
primarily
benefit
that
who
engage
in
intrafamilial
transfer
of
property
or
land
or
do
it
affect
that
who
be
transfer
ownership
to
third
party
?
be
figure
available
in
this
regard
?
I
understand
how
it
provide
a
incentive
and
encourage
new
people
to
enter
farming
.
if
we
guest
could
provide
a
further
justification
of
Macra
to
Feirme
's
position
in
respect
of
this
matter
,
I
would
welcome
it
.
what
be
the
position
on
the
rolling
reference
year
in
the
context
of
the
post
-2013
scenario
?
I
accept
that
there
have
be
a
decrease
in
the
number
of
farmer
under
the
age
of
35
and
Mr.
Gowing
indicate
that
the
figure
have
fall
from
11
%
to
7
%
.
the
high
number
of
people
who
transfer
into
other
sector
of
employment
follow
decoupling
in
2005
might
account
for
this
reduction
.
however
,
we
guest
may
have
a
view
that
run
contrary
to
this
.
the
age
barrier
should
be
40
rather
than
35
,
particularly
in
light
of
the
transfer
of
skill
into
other
sector
in
the
period
since
decoupling
.
there
may
be
many
people
who
go
into
construction
in
recent
year
who
be
over
the
age
of
35
but
still
under
40
.
this
individual
might
re-enter
farming
now
and
they
might
be
in
position
to
benefit
from
that
relief
,
if
it
be
retain
.
in
the
context
of
demographic
,
I
be
try
to
educate
myself
with
regard
to
the
number
of
farmer
who
be
under
the
age
of
35
.
I
accept
that
percentage
figure
have
be
provide
but
there
be
no
actual
number
identify
.
I
be
in
favour
of
lift
any
barrier
to
entry
for
potential
new
entrant
to
the
sector
.
I
be
not
convinced
that
the
age
barrier
of
should
be
35
.
I
would
welcome
we
guest
's
observation
on
this
.
on
carbon
sink
,
I
be
interested
in
the
argument
put
forward
by
Mr.
Gowing
in
respect
of
permanent
pasture
and
forestry
.
I
do
not
want
to
see
a
situation
develop
whereby
there
will
be
a
compromise
in
respect
of
production
.
we
have
a
extremely
good
comparative
advantage
in
the
production
of
beef
and
I
do
not
want
this
to
be
adversely
affect
.
it
have
already
be
argue
that
if
beef
production
here
be
reduce
,
desertification
would
occur
in
other
area
of
the
world
and
Ireland
would
lose
its
comparative
advantage
.
on
question
Time
last
week
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
how
we
would
circumvent
difficulty
relate
to
production
of
methane
without
compromise
agricultural
production
.
a
major
dilemma
exist
here
and
the
minister
have
yet
to
provide
a
adequate
response
.
I
would
welcome
it
if
we
guest
would
put
forward
they
view
on
this
issue
.
I
be
impressed
by
Macra
to
Feirme
's
cogent
and
well
put
together
presentation
.
as
deputy
Creed
say
,
Macra
to
Feirme
fulfil
a
important
social
function
.
however
,
it
also
retain
strong
potential
in
the
context
of
lobbying
.
I
would
like
to
hear
more
from
we
guest
on
that
.
I
take
issue
with
they
on
tax
relief
.
however
,
I
would
welcome
hear
they
counter
argument
.
that
be
not
what
I
say
.
Mr.
Gowing
may
be
misinterpret
I
slightly
.
in
the
overall
context
of
tax
relief
on
property
and
construction
,
from
a
political
point
of
view
the
idea
of
apply
further
relief
be
dirty
and
that
be
the
context
in
which
I
mean
it
.
I
be
take
by
the
idea
.
if
there
be
rolling
reference
year
,
could
external
shock
that
cause
major
fluctuation
in
income
lead
to
a
negative
situation
?
perhaps
I
be
wrong
.
I
would
like
to
tease
out
the
matter
further
with
we
guest
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
the
Mr.
Gowing
and
he
colleague
for
they
presentation
and
for
answer
member
's
question
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
the
Mr.
Gowing
and
he
colleague
for

presentation
and
for

's
question
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
the
Mr.
Gowing
and
he
colleague
for
they
presentation
and
for
answer
member
's
question
.
I
join
previous
speaker
in
wish
Mr.
Walshe
well
in
he
future
endeavour
and
I
congratulate
he
on
he
very
good
tenure
as
president
of
the
IFA
.
Mr.
Walshe
enjoy
the
respect
of
that
he
represent
but
he
also
enjoy
the
respect
of
people
outside
the
sector
.
when
the
dioxin
scare
occur
last
Christmas
,
he
show
he
true
mettle
.
many
people
outside
the
sector
be
of
the
view
that
he
response
to
that
major
crisis
be
measure
and
positive
.
I
be
sure
Mr.
Burns
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
but
it
seem
that
complete
traceability
apply
in
respect
of
the
national
sheep
identification
system
.
I
be
of
the
opinion
that
the
necessity
to
electronically
tag
animal
mean
we
have
see
the
advent
of
a
surreal
level
of
bureaucracy
.
it
be
complete
and
utter
madness
.
when
it
come
to
the
traceability
of
animal
,
Ireland
be
way
ahead
of
every
other
country
in
the
European
Union
and
,
arguably
,
in
the
world
.
I
do
not
understand
why
we
would
impose
a
new
system
on
producer
.
give
that
the
exist
system
be
work
properly
,
there
be
no
need
for
a
new
one
.
Mr.
Burns
state
that
the
matter
be
with
the
European
Parliament
.
do
the
concept
of
introduce
a
new
system
emerge
on
foot
of
a
commission
proposal
?
if
the
answer
be
"
yes
"
,
will
the
European
Parliament
vote
on
that
proposal
?
will
the
matter
be
deal
with
under
the
new
co-decision
procedure
as
it
relate
to
agriculture
?
if
it
do
come
under
that
procedure
,
then
Irish
mep
will
have
a
significant
say
in
how
the
proposal
will
proceed
.
some
people
have
state
that
it
be
a
do
deal
.
I
know
I
can
speak
for
Alan
Kelly
,
MEP
,
in
state
that
this
proposal
will
be
oppose
if
it
be
return
to
the
European
Parliament
or
that
the
derogation
that
be
be
call
for
will
be
support
.
I
say
this
on
the
basis
that
a
common
-
sense
approach
must
be
adopt
.
this
new
system
be
completely
unnecessary
.
I
take
on
board
what
Mr.
Burns
state
.
the
committee
should
adopt
a
strong
position
on
the
matter
.
I
will
be
communicate
with
we
political
representative
in
Brussels
in
respect
of
it
.
if
there
be
scope
for
a
derogation
,
I
hope
there
will
be
cross
-
party
support
for
it
.
I
be
amazed
that
the
EU
Commission
would
seek
to
impose
such
a
measure
when
the
sector
in
this
country
be
begin
to
emerge
from
the
trough
it
be
in
.
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
try
to
support
the
case
be
make
.
a
unanimous
,
cross-party
decision
have
be
take
to
write
to
the
Minister
for
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
the
Minister
for
Health
and
Children
,
the
Taoiseach
and
the
propose
new
EU
Commissioner
,
Ms
Máire
Geoghegan
-
Quinn
.
we
will
individually
lobby
the
minister
to
go
back
to
Brussels
on
the
issue
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
come
before
the
committee
.
I
wish
Mr.
Walshe
and
Mr.
Burns
the
very
good
.
they
have
do
they
job
very
well
in
the
past
number
of
year
in
represent
farmer
.
I
know
they
will
not
go
away
but
will
keep
bang
on
door
in
farmer
's
interest
.
the
meeting
will
now
adjourn
until
next
Wednesday
,
when
Teagasc
will
be
in
attendance
.
I
,
too
,
welcome
the
group
.
it
be
important
to
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
plurality
of
view
on
farming
issue
and
that
there
be
group
outside
the
traditional
farm
lobby
organisation
such
as
the
IFA
and
ICMSA
whose
voice
should
be
recognise
.
I
will
start
with
some
of
the
basic
assumption
.
one
be
that
farmer
be
price
taker
,
not
price
maker
.
it
be
a
line
that
be
often
trot
out
.
why
have
we
arrive
at
that
scenario
?
there
be
a
time
when
farmer
control
the
co-operative
movement
.
production
and
distribution
network
be
more
localised
and
farmer
have
a
great
say
at
local
level
.
in
recent
year
,
as
co-operative
have
become
more
corporatise
or
have
be
mould
into
corporate
entity
,
the
voice
of
the
farmer
have
dissipate
.
that
be
relevant
to
the
issue
of
why
dairy
farmer
find
themselves
in
they
current
position
,
whereby
they
must
accept
the
price
determine
by
the
market
and
they
be
no
long
actor
or
agent
in
that
process
.
we
guest
be
advocate
that
a
regulator
should
be
appoint
.
I
take
a
similar
view
to
deputy
Creed
in
respect
of
this
matter
,
namely
,
that
we
do
not
want
another
layer
of
quasi
-
non
-
governmental
organisation
,
quango
,
be
create
.
there
be
enough
such
body
and
I
could
not
support
the
appointment
of
a
regulator
.
however
,
I
would
advocate
that
fair
trade
legislation
be
introduce
.
I
do
not
understand
why
ICOS
or
the
mighty
co-operative
movement
be
not
lobby
the
multiple
at
a
high
level
to
ensure
that
a
fair
price
be
pay
to
primary
producer
.
I
do
not
agree
with
the
government
's
position
on
a
potential
code
of
conduct
.
such
a
code
will
lack
tooth
and
,
ultimately
,
will
not
yield
a
proper
price
for
farmer
.
however
,
I
support
,
without
question
,
the
idea
that
fair
trade
legislation
should
be
introduce
so
that
primary
producer
will
retain
a
degree
of
autonomy
in
respect
of
or
control
over
what
they
produce
and
the
means
by
which
they
produce
it
.
in
most
case
,
there
be
a
lack
of
transparency
regard
the
profit
of
the
large
multiple
.
they
practice
in
the
context
of
how
they
treat
primary
producer
be
well
document
.
a
legislative
change
will
be
require
if
matter
in
this
regard
be
to
be
place
on
a
more
equitable
footing
.
in
that
sense
,
we
guest
should
not
fear
;
the
committee
be
well
aware
of
the
concern
they
have
express
in
that
regard
.
that
concern
have
be
well
document
and
the
committee
have
hold
numerous
hearing
and
be
work
on
that
matter
.
how
do
we
guest
arrive
at
a
figure
of
6000
with
regard
to
the
number
of
dairy
farmer
who
cease
production
last
year
?
I
be
not
question
the
veracity
of
that
figure
,
but
I
would
like
we
guest
to
identify
its
source
.
they
state
that
in
2004
there
be
24000
dairy
farmer
,
whereas
in
2009
this
have
fall
to
18000
.
will
they
indicate
from
where
this
figure
originate
?
be
today
's
market
price
for
milk
as
low
as
19
cent
per
litre
?
I
think
there
have
be
a
increase
in
that
regard
.
perhaps
we
guest
produce
they
document
a
long
time
ago
and
the
price
have
not
be
update
.
I
take
issue
with
we
guest
's
approach
to
dairy
farmer
sell
to
the
high
pay
processor
.
I
be
operate
on
the
assumption
that
most
dairy
farmer
be
member
of
co-operative
movement
.
what
,
therefore
,
would
be
the
permutation
for
a
dairy
farmer
who
be
a
shareholder
in
the
Dairygold
Co-Operative
Society
Limited
?
why
would
he
or
she
want
to
sell
to
another
co-operative
entity
?
I
would
have
think
that
people
would
have
a
vested
interest
in
sell
to
they
own
co-op
because
,
theoretically
,
there
would
be
a
financial
yield
to
they
at
some
point
in
the
future
.
on
behalf
of
the
group
,
I
thank
the
committee
for
listen
to
we
and
any
help
it
can
offer
we
.
I
join
in
welcoming
Animal
Health
Ireland
to
the
committee
.
it
be
vital
that
we
seek
to
maintain
and
improve
upon
the
comparative
advantage
we
hold
in
term
of
beef
and
livestock
export
.
we
have
a
particular
comparative
advantage
.
I
be
pleased
to
see
the
presence
of
a
organisation
that
be
not
necessarily
a
statutory
body
,
but
a
independent
body
involve
all
the
stakeholder
,
include
the
scientific
and
commercial
sector
,
to
deal
with
improve
this
comparative
advantage
.
I
welcome
the
work
be
do
.
it
seem
the
figure
of
€
500000
commit
by
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
over
a
five
-
year
term
,
while
welcome
,
appear
to
be
a
relatively
modest
sum
,
give
that
disease
eradication
be
very
pertinent
to
the
whole
issue
of
improve
we
export
potential
.
I
hope
there
will
be
scope
,
notwithstand
the
current
environment
,
for
improvement
on
that
figure
to
assist
AHI
with
its
work
.
do
AHI
agree
that
perhaps
not
every
primary
or
livestock
producer
be
adequately
au
fait
with
such
disease
as
BVD
and
IBR
?
there
may
be
a
dearth
of
knowledge
in
respect
of
this
disease
and
more
work
should
be
do
.
be
there
widespread
knowledge
of
all
such
disease
among
livestock
holder
and
primary
producer
?
we
all
know
about
tuberculosis
,
for
example
,
and
we
could
quote
the
history
,
chapter
and
verse
.
be
there
adequate
knowledge
among
primary
producer
?
will
the
work
of
AHI
inform
they
knowledge
down
the
line
?
will
a
stage
be
reach
whereby
every
primary
producer
will
know
the
range
of
disease
and
will
be
in
a
position
to
have
indicator
for
they
in
place
?
I
will
leave
it
at
that
for
now
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
Mr.
Magan
and
Mr.
O'Flaherty
for
they
presentation
and
for
answer
the
question
raise
.
I
be
glad
they
have
indicate
that
they
will
update
we
on
any
report
or
concern
that
might
be
relevant
to
this
committee
's
work
.
I
thank
they
for
give
that
commitment
.
if
it
be
necessary
for
they
to
attend
the
committee
again
over
the
next
12
month
we
would
be
delighted
to
welcome
they
back
here
.
I
thank
the
chairman
.
I
too
welcome
Mr.
Ryan
,
Mr.
Maguire
and
Ms
McCann
to
the
committee
.
I
have
some
very
short
and
glaringly
obvious
question
to
which
I
would
like
immediate
answer
.
do
the
Irish
Draught
Horse
Breeders
Association
apply
to
take
ownership
or
control
of
the
studbook
?
do
the
Department
recognise
that
the
Irish
Draught
Horse
Society
have
make
a
application
for
the
studbook
?
that
seem
like
a
obvious
question
but
I
just
want
a
answer
for
the
record
.
do
the
Department
recognise
that
the
Irish
Draught
Horse
Society
have
a
legal
personality
?
I
would
appreciate
answer
to
that
three
question
before
proceed
with
my
next
round
of
question
.
in
effect
,
no
application
have
be
make
at
close
of
—
—
I
want
to
be
unequivocal
about
this
.
be
it
correct
that
no
application
be
receive
by
the
IDHBA
to
take
control
of
the
stud
book
?
I
have
to
keep
remind
myself
about
why
we
be
here
and
what
be
the
issue
.
the
society
be
seek
to
take
ownership
and
control
of
the
stud
book
to
preserve
the
breed
in
perpetuity
.
I
,
therefore
,
have
a
question
about
passport
.
when
a
passport
be
issue
by
Horse
Sport
Ireland
for
a
draught
horse
with
draught
horse
parentage
on
both
side
,
do
it
state
that
the
horse
be
a
Irish
draught
horse
or
a
Irish
sport
horse
?
for
a
period
,
therefore
,
in
the
1990
Irish
draught
be
not
record
on
passport
of
foal
who
be
bear
with
Irish
draught
parentage
on
both
side
.
I
would
like
to
fast
forward
to
the
Department
's
correspondence
of
16
October
2009
with
Ms
Anne
Loughnane
,
which
refer
to
the
application
to
maintain
the
stud
book
for
the
Irish
draught
horse
.
Mr.
Michael
Dillon
in
response
to
Ms
Loughnane
's
application
for
approval
under
EC
equine
Studbook
and
Competition
Regulation
SI
399/2004
to
maintain
a
stud
book
for
the
Irish
draught
horse
outline
the
reason
for
the
intend
refusal
of
the
application
.
he
state
:
horse
of
the
breed
to
be
enter
or
register
in
the
stud
book
for
which
approval
be
seek
may
be
enter
or
register
in
a
section
of
a
stud
book
which
be
maintain
by
a
person
or
a
international
organisation
or
association
already
approve
and
operate
in
conformity
with
annex
95353
...
HSI
be
already
approve
to
maintain
the
stud
book
...
and
can
already
be
register
in
the
exist
approve
Irish
draught
horse
stud
book
maintain
by
HSI
...
the
minister
may
refuse
to
grant
a
approval
for
the
purpose
of
maintain
a
stud
book
if
he
or
she
consider
that
the
granting
of
approval
would
endanger
the
preservation
of
the
breed
or
jeopardise
the
improvement
or
selection
programme
of
one
or
more
organisation
or
association
already
approve
.
this
be
central
to
the
debate
.
if
we
accept
that
the
IDHS
have
a
legal
personality
and
its
modus
operandi
be
the
preservation
of
the
breed
,
it
be
ludicrous
for
anybody
,
include
a
minister
or
official
,
to
suggest
its
application
for
control
of
the
stud
book
would
potentially
be
consider
to
endanger
the
breed
.
why
can
nobody
come
up
with
a
solution
that
suggest
that
if
the
IDHS
take
control
of
the
stud
book
,
it
will
in
no
way
impede
the
future
of
the
sport
horse
while
also
ensure
the
pedigree
and
future
of
the
draught
horse
?
if
the
society
be
concerned
about
the
breed
,
it
be
the
most
likely
organisation
to
have
the
purity
of
the
breed
at
heart
.
it
would
cost
the
Exchequer
nothing
in
the
sense
that
the
breed
would
be
maintain
but
the
future
economic
viability
of
other
breed
would
also
be
ensure
as
a
result
.
I
can
not
tally
this
.
this
be
a
overtly
political
decision
,
which
have
no
regard
to
the
future
of
the
breed
.
with
due
respect
,
it
be
give
as
a
reason
for
the
refusal
to
grant
control
over
the
stud
book
.
the
letter
quote
from
the
legislation
and
this
be
use
as
one
of
the
reason
for
refusal
.
it
state
,
"
...
he
or
she
consider
that
the
granting
of
approval
would
endanger
the
preservation
of
the
breed
or
jeopardise
the
improvement
or
selection
programme
of
one
or
more
organisation
...
"
.
Mr.
Ryan
state
that
HSI
have
more
competence
to
ensure
the
continuation
of
the
breed
but
it
be
disingenuous
to
suggest
that
the
reason
for
refuse
to
grant
control
over
the
stud
book
to
the
IDHS
be
there
may
be
a
potential
danger
to
the
breed
therein
.
that
be
how
that
could
be
interpret
by
a
layman
such
as
myself
.
how
would
that
be
detrimental
?
on
behalf
of
the

I
welcome
the
member
of
Teagasc
.
while
there
have
be
several
attempt
to
bring
they
before
the
committee
,
it
be
good
to
see
that
they
be
here
,
finally
.
on
the
whole
area
of
research
and
the
McCarthy
report
proposal
for
one
centralise
research
body
with
the
various
interest
seek
to
draw
from
centralise
funding
,
what
will
the
permutation
of
that
proposal
be
for
Teagasc
,
if
it
be
implement
?
in
term
of
Teagasc
's
current
research
function
,
what
percentage
of
the
proposal
actually
come
to
fruition
within
the
marketplace
or
in
the
agricultural
sector
per
se
?
I
be
a
rational
person
,
although
not
a
scientist
.
as
a
layman
I
understand
that
while
there
be
many
proposal
in
scientific
research
,
many
of
they
could
fall
by
the
wayside
,
with
research
end
up
in
a
blind
alley
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
from
Teagasc
as
to
how
applicable
much
of
its
research
may
be
in
real
term
,
the
budget
line
and
whether
this
be
warrant
and
if
a
case
could
be
make
against
the
proposal
in
the
McCarthy
report
.
obviously
,
it
will
be
the
task
of
politician
down
the
line
to
make
decision
as
to
how
such
funding
be
designate
.
I
would
like
the
view
of
the
delegate
on
that
.
I
would
also
like
to
hear
about
the
intellectual
property
rights
in
research
be
carry
out
by
Teagasc
.
while
I
realise
it
be
look
for
more
effective
way
of
interact
with
the
food
industry
,
and
successful
and
commercially
viable
proposal
might
arise
from
that
,
the
question
be
who
will
hold
the
intellectual
property
rights
,
in
the
event
,
and
whether
the
food
industry
be
get
a
cheap
advantage
which
it
could
turn
into
a
large
profit
.
can
anything
be
claw
back
by
Teagasc
in
the
event
of
such
effort
become
commercially
viable
?
could
somebody
please
tell
I
what
be
go
on
in
the
local
office
,
in
Mallow
,
for
instance
?
I
shall
be
accuse
of
be
somewhat
parochial
in
this
regard
,
but
it
be
probably
typical
of
some
other
office
around
the
country
.
we
be
tell
that
it
could
be
move
to
Fermoy
or
Mitchelstown
and
the
staff
be
somewhat
confused
about
what
be
go
on
.
they
do
not
know
what
the
future
hold
for
they
.
could
somebody
please
clarify
the
future
of
the
Mallow
office
?
also
,
on
the
advisory
service
in
particular
,
if
there
be
a
40
%
reduction
in
staff
in
this
area
,
will
this
give
rise
to
the
12
%
project
decline
,
or
have
this
be
factor
in
?
I
refer
to
the
advisory
office
rationalisation
proposal
.
by
the
end
of
2012
,
the
report
say
,
there
be
expect
to
up
to
a
40
%
reduction
in
all
advisory
service
staff
,
and
the
project
decline
in
number
be
in
the
order
of
12
%
.
I
just
wonder
about
the
exact
correlation
there
and
again
,
perhaps
,
Teagasc
might
clarify
this
.
be
we
hand
over
the
advisory
service
to
the
agricultural
consultant
association
or
such
body
and
in
the
event
,
can
a
mix
of
two
such
area
of
expertise
effectively
co-exist
?
I
be
reluctant
to
hand
over
such
a
service
to
one
or
two
entity
and
believe
that
a
strong
capability
exist
within
the
service
as
it
be
.
a
40
%
reduction
in
all
advisory
service
staff
be
a
dangerous
departure
and
I
would
not
like
to
see
this
.
while
I
can
understand
the
need
for
rationalisation
,
a
excellent
service
be
be
provide
within
this
local
office
.
Teagasc
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
,
however
,
in
term
of
my
way
of
think
on
advocate
that
the
service
should
be
near
the
client
.
in
particular
,
with
the
Mallow
proposal
,
there
be
the
question
as
to
whether
the
service
will
be
move
further
away
from
its
client
catchment
area
.
if
we
be
talk
about
the
client
,
ultimately
,
the
service
have
to
be
near
he
or
she
.
forgive
I
if
I
sound
parochial
,
but
I
be
use
Mallow
as
a
benchmark
for
other
office
.
on
the
agricultural
college
,
we
need
a
further
explanation
of
the
transfer
of
undertaking
.
my
impression
of
Pallaskenry
be
that
it
comprise
Teagasc
staff
employ
within
that
college
.
there
be
no
ambiguity
in
my
mind
about
that
.
perhaps
I
can
be
forgiven
if
a
incorrect
impression
be
convey
to
the
committee
on
that
matter
.
I
shall
leave
it
at
that
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
apologise
to
Mr.
Boyle
and
he
colleague
for
the
postponement
of
the
meeting
on
16
December
due
to
all
the
vote
that
be
call
on
that
day
.
I
thank
they
for
be
with
we
,
for
give
we
a
overview
of
the
position
,
for
they
presentation
and
for
answer
the
member
's
question
.
I
think
this
meeting
would
conclude
at
12.30
p.m.
or
1
p.m.
but
it
be
now
approach
2
p.m
.
I
thank
the
representative
and
the
member
for
they
contribution
.
I
welcome
the
minister
and
he
official
to
the
committee
.
I
refer
to
the
animal
health
and
welfare
Bill
.
for
the
record
,
a
charade
be
be
play
out
here
in
respect
of
the
animal
health
and
welfare
Bill
.
I
have
raise
this
issue
on
numerous
occasion
.
I
acknowledge
that
I
have
be
offer
briefing
on
the
matter
and
it
remain
for
I
to
organise
that
.
that
be
a
matter
for
I
.
however
,
it
be
include
in
the
legislative
programme
and
we
seek
to
have
it
publish
with
haste
.
will
the
Bill
deal
with
non-farm
animal
and
will
a
undertaking
be
give
in
respect
of
the
treatment
of
horse
?
a
issue
be
surface
throughout
the
country
at
present
whereby
horse
be
be
abandon
.
it
be
particularly
prevalent
in
the
area
of
north
Cork
and
I
wish
to
see
provision
in
the
Bill
which
would
deal
with
that
issue
.
I
call
on
the
minister
to
respond
in
this
regard
.
I
refer
to
section
17a
and
I
agree
with
the
provision
.
I
believe
a
robust
provision
be
necessary
to
deal
with
the
health
and
welfare
and
the
control
of
disease
of
animal
.
if
robust
provision
be
missing
then
one
compromise
the
comparative
advantage
we
have
economically
in
respect
of
the
production
of
food
.
arguably
,
there
be
a
authoritarian
streak
to
the
provision
,
but
it
be
one
with
which
I
have
no
particular
problem
.
if
we
do
not
have
information
about
the
number
of
incident
that
occur
under
the
section
17A
provision
then
the
committee
be
leave
in
the
dark
in
respect
of
how
we
make
a
inform
decision
about
whether
to
continue
with
it
.
while
the
minister
's
party
be
in
the
majority
and
will
decide
the
issue
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
I
have
no
particular
problem
with
section
17a
,
I
remain
concerned
that
a
lack
of
knowledge
exist
in
respect
of
it
and
I
call
on
the
minister
to
talk
we
through
the
provision
.
the
minister
state
"
where
the
exercise
of
the
power
in
section
17a
be
activate
,
a
authorise
officer
must
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
before
act
.
in
the
case
of
entry
to
a
private
dwelling
,
a
search
warrant
be
require
"
.
I
call
on
the
minister
to
talk
we
through
that
process
and
to
give
some
indication
to
the
committee
of
how
this
have
be
enforce
in
the
past
12
month
.
it
be
high
time
the
animal
health
and
welfare
Bill
be
introduce
.
I
realise
a
significant
number
of
issue
attach
to
the
Bill
and
its
publication
.
I
trust
that
when
the
provision
of
the
Bill
deal
with
non-farm
animal
be
publish
they
will
include
some
provision
in
respect
of
or
do
something
about
the
number
of
horse
be
slaughter
and
leave
to
die
in
public
area
throughout
the
country
,
and
that
strenuous
and
strong
provision
would
be
include
in
the
Bill
in
this
regard
.
I
call
on
the
minister
will
speak
to
that
issue
in
he
reply
.
I
agree
with
the
minister
's
point
about
the
responsibility
of
the
owner
of
horse
,
of
that
there
be
no
question
.
I
also
agree
that
the
minister
and
he
Department
have
do
they
good
on
funding
of
local
authority
.
he
have
acknowledge
the
role
play
by
animal
welfare
group
.
I
be
in
total
agreement
with
the
minister
on
that
point
.
there
be
a
issue
regard
people
who
have
not
register
horse
and
who
operate
outside
of
register
premise
.
act
of
cruelty
be
be
visit
upon
animal
who
have
,
for
want
of
a
good
term
,
no
fix
abode
.
I
seek
the
inclusion
of
some
provision
in
the
legislation
that
will
put
a
onus
on
the
owner
,
or
will
ensure
that
every
horse
have
some
identifiable
mark
,
to
ensure
that
the
ISPCA
and
the
local
authority
will
not
be
hamper
in
they
work
in
deal
with
incident
of
act
of
cruelty
to
animal
.
when
they
have
to
investigate
incident
,
they
will
be
able
to
trace
the
animal
back
to
the
owner
.
that
be
my
view
on
this
issue
.

for
the
record
I
have
formally
request
that
the
Ombudsman
be
invite
to
the
committee
to
address
the
content
of
she
report
on
the
Lost
at
Sea
scheme
.
the
issue
be
very
simple
.
it
be
about
whether
any
citizen
can
have
confidence
in
the
fact
that
if
he
or
she
make
a
complaint
to
the
ombudsman
and
where
he
or
she
make
a
adjudication
that
the
recommendation
be
adhere
to
.
in
this
case
somebody
make
a
complaint
to
the
Ombudsman
and
the
ombudsman
make
a
recommendation
that
be
subsequently
reject
by
the
government
.
if
the
Ombudsman
have
place
the
report
before
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
that
be
a
very
serious
matter
and
have
serious
implication
for
the
faith
the
State
can
have
in
the
Office
of
the
Ombudsman
and
whether
the
citizen
can
reliably
make
a
complaint
and
have
confidence
in
that
office
.
the
ombudsman
should
be
give
the
opportunity
to
appear
before
this
committee
to
facilitate
a
exchange
of
view
and
a
question
and
answer
session
on
the
content
of
she
report
.
it
be
totally
inadequate
that
we
have
a
scenario
whereby
we
have
statement
in
the
dáil
because
that
do
not
facilitate
a
process
where
I
,
as
a
member
of
this
House
,
could
have
have
time
to
question
the
minister
involved
in
this
process
.
it
be
a
set
piece
and
as
a
process
it
be
fundamentally
flawed
.
the
only
way
we
can
address
that
be
by
give
the
Ombudsman
a
opportunity
to
present
herself
to
the
committee
to
allow
we
have
a
proper
discussion
on
the
content
of
the
report
.
in
term
of
the
way
the
State
work
it
be
a
sad
day
if
we
choose
as
a
democratic
body
to
ignore
the
finding
of
the
ombudsman
's
report
because
it
will
have
implication
for
any
citizen
who
make
a
complaint
in
the
future
.
we
should
tread
carefully
on
a
issue
such
as
this
one
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
I
reject
any
contention
by
any
member
of
the
House
that
I
be
seek
to
politicise
this
issue
.
what
be
at
the
heart
of
this
issue
be
the
facilitation
of
the
ombudsman
to
allow
she
expand
on
she
own
report
.
all
that
I
ask
be
that
she
would
be
facilitate
to
expand
on
she
report
in
this
committee
.
she
have
not
be
give
that
opportunity
and
I
be
merely
request
,
devoid
of
any
political
motivation
,
that
she
be
give
that
opportunity
.
this
be
a
serious
matter
,
regardless
of
the
political
party
one
be
a
member
of
,
when
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
be
furnish
with
she
report
.
that
be
a
rejection
of
the
report
and
we
be
merely
seek
a
opportunity
for
the
ombudsman
to
present
she
finding
to
this
committee
.
I
have
question
about
the
Lost
at
Sea
report
which
I
wish
to
pose
to
she
in
a
public
forum
such
as
this
.
all
I
ask
be
that
she
be
afford
that
opportunity
.
I
will
not
be
accuse
of
politicise
this
issue
by
a
member
of
the
House
.
I
respectfully
propose
that
we
do
not
open
up
this
debate
now
.
the
issue
here
be
the
motion
before
we
and
whether
we
agree
to
it
.
I
formally
second
that
motion
.
in
so
do
,
I
agree
that
some
opportunity
must
be
afford
to
the
ombudsman
so
that
we
can
fulfil
we
democratic
function
,
as
well
as
allow
she
a
opportunity
to
present
the
finding
of
the
report
as
part
of
such
a
investigation
.
I
hereby
second
the
motion
.
I
apologise
that
I
must
leave
to
deal
with
the
Fines
Bill
in
the
Dáil
.
we
have
have
a
good
hearing

fair
play

all
involve

O'Riordan

Smyth

how
many
company
do
Meat
Industry
Ireland
represent
?
my
second
question
,
if
it
be
not
too
pertinent
,
be
how
this
new
quality
standard
and
grading
system
have
affect
the
profit
margin
of
the
meat
industry
since
it
have
be
introduce
.
have
there
be
a
significant
increase
in
profit
accrue
to
the
meat
industry
as
a
result
of
the
implementation
of
this
relatively
new
grading
system
?
I
ask
that
question
because
I
know
one
farmer
in
particular
who
be
get
less
of
a
return
since
the
introduction
of
this
system
.
there
be
legitimate
question
about
this
new
system
.
I
apologise
for
not
be
here
for
deputy
Eamon
Scanlon
's
intervention
.
I
know
he
have
a
particular
expertise
in
live
cattle
export
.
therefore
,
if
I
repeat
question
that
have
already
be
ask
,
I
apologise
.
a
monopoly
pertain
in
term
of
live
cattle
export
.
if
one
want
to
export
live
cattle
,
one
have
to
go
through
a
one
or
two
processor
.
the
trade
seem
to
be
control
by
a
very
small
number
of
operator
,
one
in
particular
who
shall
remain
nameless
.
how
do
that
position
affect
the
price
that
accrue
to
the
primary
producer
?
be
it
possible
to
unlock
that
monopolistic
position
to
allow
for
the
same
level
of
efficiency
in
term
of
the
slaughtering
process
and
for
access
to
market
through
the
work
of
Bord
Bia
?
when
there
be
a
great
degree
of
competition
in
the
slaughtering
process
it
be
important
to
ensure
that
the
primary
producer
can
shop
around
in
term
of
that
market
.
I
would
like
to
hear
the
view
of
Bord
Bia
and
Meat
Industry
Ireland
on
that
point
.
we
would
appreciate
that
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
I
thank
Mr.
Healy
,
Mr.
Brickley
and
they
colleague
for
they
presentation
and
for
answer
question
.
I
thank
Mr.
Nolan
and
Mr.
Ryan
for
appear
before
the
committee
today
.
they
submission
be
hard
-
hit
and
they
do
not
pull
any
punch
with
regard
to
they
view
on
Coillte
.
this
be
a
issue
which
the
committee
need
to
consider
seriously
.
the
submission
state
that
the
witness
believe
the
forestry
industry
be
unsustainable
as
a
result
of
the
reckless
misadventure
of
Coillte
.
if
this
be
be
say
by
the
contractor
's
association
who
be
at
the
coalface
,
so
to
speak
,
this
need
to
be
investigate
.
I
support
the
view
of
deputy
Sheehan
in
that
regard
.
I
would
also
argue
that
perhaps
we
need
to
discuss
this
with
the
new
minister
.
just
before
Christmas
,
the
Oireachtas
pass
a
Bill
which
give
Coillte
a
re-financing
facility
of
approximately
€400
million
.
in
my
view
,
this
measure
be
very
opaque
,
with
more
unknown
about
this
facility
than
there
be
known
,
so
to
speak
.
the
manner
in
which
that
procedure
be
rush
through
the
Dáil
raise
a
number
of
question
,
some
of
which
be
now
come
forward
in
this
submission
.
there
be
a
corporate
governance
issue
with
regard
to
Coillte
.
there
be
no
question
but
that
its
own
standing
staff
quota
have
be
reduce
significantly
over
the
year
and
no
question
but
that
Coillte
take
a
punt
on
other
avenue
of
business
which
have
not
borne
fruit
.
I
realise
it
go
into
the
construction
industry
at
the
height
of
the
game
and
invest
in
venture
such
as
Medite
and
so
on
and
this
have
not
borne
fruit
.
however
,
if
the
forestry
contractor
be
question
issue
with
regard
to
machinery
sale
and
the
investment
or
diversification
into
nursing
home
and
if
this
be
at
a
price
of
the
quality
of
wood
be
grow
and
the
management
of
the
forestry
,
then
we
need
to
raise
this
issue
with
Coillte
.
I
have
a
couple
of
question
on
the
submission
.
I
want
to
increase
my
understanding
of
the
manner
in
which
contractor
be
force
to
take
responsibility
for
the
forest
estate
.
can
the
witness
elaborate
on
the
ratio
between
standing
sale
and
harvest
sale
?
as
I
understand
it
,
Coillte
seem
to
be
shift
the
goalpost
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
mill
be
have
to
compete
with
the
contractor
on
management
and
on
harvesting
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
I
wonder
if
we
be
set
a
dangerous
precedent
.
I
would
like
the
delegate
to
elaborate
on
that
.
I
would
also
like
to
ask
about
the
percentage
of
land
that
be
forest
.
do
the
Irish
Forestry
Contractor
Association
have
any
idea
on
grow
the
number
of
tree
need
to
reach
the
17
%
target
?
I
be
also
concerned
about
the
issue
of
whether
contractor
and
other
stakeholder
in
the
industry
should
be
represent
on
the
board
of
Coillte
.
would
that
help
to
address
the
whole
issue
of
corporate
governance
?
if
contractor
be
treat
as
major
stakeholder
,
at
least
they
will
have
some
sort
of
say
at
the
table
when
decision
be
make
about
what
be
happen
on
the
ground
.
I
be
most
familiar
with
the
Ballyhoura
region
.
I
have
see
at
first
hand
the
value
of
the
amenity
,
include
the
bicycle
trail
,
which
have
be
develop
there
.
more
and
more
,
however
,
I
be
witness
problem
with
Coillte
's
forestry
management
.
I
look
at
forestry
as
a
layman
,
as
I
do
not
have
a
expert
view
on
it
.
every
time
I
walk
around
the
Ballyhoura
Mountain
,
I
can
see
the
amount
of
dumping
that
be
take
place
.
I
be
sure
this
be
replicate
throughout
the
country
.
when
I
be
in
the
Ballyhoura
region
last
Sunday
,
I
think
the
amount
of
dumping
be
absolutely
scandalous
.
I
get
a
sense
that
the
number
of
standing
staff
have
be
reduce
to
the
extent
that
that
who
work
to
manage
or
monitor
the
forest
resource
be
contractor
,
rather
than
permanent
staff
.
I
suggest
,
from
a
layman
's
perspective
,
that
the
quality
of
wood
may
have
diminish
somewhat
as
well
.
there
be
a
time
when
between
25
and
30
man
would
have
be
work
in
a
area
like
the
Skahanagh
and
Castlepook
region
.
I
realise
that
the
mechanisation
and
modernisation
of
machinery
have
supplant
many
of
that
man
.
there
be
a
time
when
that
present
on
the
ground
be
able
to
monitor
what
be
go
on
.
it
seem
to
I
that
Coillte
have
completely
and
utterly
shif
its
etho
towards
a
kind
of
outsource
.
it
be
now
try
to
bring
its
outsource
down
to
the
low
common
denominator
,
by
begin
to
squeeze
the
contractor
who
be
work
at
the
coalface
.
I
be
glad
we
have
receive
this
submission
today
.
to
a
certain
extent
,
it
have
open
we
eye
to
what
be
go
on
.
I
would
like
the
delegate
to
elaborate
on
the
current
pricing
mechanism
for
the
contractor
.
where
do
they
envisage
that
the
future
growth
in
they
industry
will
take
place
?
can
we
get
some
sort
of
elaboration
on
how
they
see
that
be
address
?
how
can
we
assist
that
process
?
can
the
committee
take
it
then
that
because
the
forest
-
scape
be
currently
so
sparse
,
replant
be
not
occur
?
there
be
certain
thing
we
can
say
under
parliamentary
privilege
which
Mr.
Nolan
cannot
.
I
appreciate
he
position
.
the
committee
,
however
,
can
ask
Coillte
about
a
issue
raise
by
Mr.
Nolan
concern
forestry
machinery
which
he
feel
should
be
investigate
.
can
I
clarify
this
point
?
do
Coillte
have
a
obligation
to
clear
this
up
?

I
join
in
welcoming
the
ombudsman
before
the
joint
committee
.
I
will
not
address
the
aspect
of
she
presentation
pertain
to
the
constitutional
aspect
of
she
office
as
that
matter
should
be
leave
for
another
day
.
I
believe
that
today
's
meeting
of
the
committee
should
deal
specifically
with
the
Byrne
case
and
the
complaint
make
by
the
Byrne
family
.
I
wish
to
get
a
sense
of
where
the
Byrne
family
be
come
from
in
the
first
instance
.
I
wish
to
establish
whether
they
primary
motivation
in
the
first
instance
be
compensation
or
the
replacement
of
tonnage
.
I
ask
this
question
because
both
the
minister
,
in
he
statement
to
the
Dáil
on
4
February
,
and
Mr.
Plunkett
seek
to
convey
the
clear
impression
that
somehow
,
the
primary
motivation
be
a
compensatory
package
.
however
,
to
my
mind
the
Byrne
's
primary
motivation
be
the
replacement
of
tonnage
.
I
wish
to
get
a
sense
of
the
particular
provision
under
which
Mr.
Byrne
make
the
complaint
in
the
first
instance
and
I
ask
the
ombudsman
to
articulate
what
they
be
.
first
be
that
the
special
circumstance
of
he
family
's
case
be
not
properly
consider
by
the
Department
and
that
the
lose
at
sea
scheme
have
not
be
properly
advertise
.
the
ombudsman
should
speak
a
little
more
on
that
issue
.
in
addition
,
the
Department
write
to
a
number
of
potential
applicant
at
the
time
and
it
already
have
record
of
the
lose
at
sea
.
as
for
the
record
concern
the
lose
at
sea
,
be
the
term
"
deep
storage
"
the
ombudsman
's
own
or
be
it
a
term
that
be
use
by
departmental
official
?
it
suggest
to
I
that
the
Byrne
family
feel
there
should
have
be
some
record
of
the
loss
of
the
Skifjord
and
therefore
that
they
should
have
come
within
the
criterion
.
I
wish
to
establish
in
layman
's
term
the
reason
that
be
not
the
case
.
therefore
,
one
aspect
of
Mr.
Byrne
's
complaint
be
that
essentially
,
the
Department
do
not
try
hard
enough
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
this
boat
have
sink
and
therefore
,
the
ombudsman
consider
such
a
response
to
be
inadequate
in
the
context
of
design
the
scheme
.
on
the
compensatory
issue
,
the
Ombudsman
's
report
state
on
page
82
that
:
because
the
scheme
have
long
since
expire
and
because
of
subsequent
development
in
relation
to
Ireland
's
sea-fishing
capacity
,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
attempt
to
apply
the
term
of
the
scheme
by
way
of
a
remedy
—
even
though
this
be
precisely
what
the
Byrne
family
be
seek
.
besides
,
I
could
not
recommend
that
the
Department
apply
the
term
of
this
scheme
to
the
Byrne
family
in
circumstance
where
they
application
do
not
meet
at
least
two
of
the
qualifying
condition
.
give
this
scheme
have
long
since
expire
,
I
seek
to
establish
,
in
layman
's
term
,
the
reason
the
Ombudsman
do
not
allow
for
tonnage
to
be
divvy
out
,
the
reason
she
take
a
decision
to
award
compensation
and
the
reason
she
use
the
decommissioning
scheme
as
the
criterion
.
the
minister
,
in
he
speech
to
the
Dáil
state
that
give
that
the
scheme
be
intend
to
allow
family
to
continue
a
family
tradition
of
sea
fishing
,
it
be
difficult
to
see
how
it
could
be
sustain
that
the
Byrne
family
be
disadvantage
by
the
failure
of
its
application
some
20
year
late
.
after
the
sinking
,
he
say
,
the
family
be
see
,
perhaps
understandably
,
to
have
leave
the
fishing
industry
for
the
subsequent
20
year
.
there
be
a
issue
of
quota
here
.
we
would
support
the
fact
that
compensation
be
pay
.
the
ombudsman
will
correct
I
if
I
be
wrong
,
but
even
if
she
could
have
recommend
that
tonnage
should
be
give
to
the
family
,
this
could
not
have
be
do
,
in
any
event
,
because
of
the
expiration
of
the
scheme
,
quite
apart
from
the
restriction
on
tonnage
.
the
Ombudsman
refer
to
a
interview
with
Mr.
Carroll
,
the
former
Secretary
General
,
on
page
51
.
how
specifically
design
be
the
scheme
?
it
seem
to
I
that
it
be
not
a
wide
range
scheme
,
but
be
very
much
target
towards
certain
individual
.
Mr.
Carroll
agree
that
the
official
"
be
negatively
dispose
towards
a
change
in
policy
"
as
be
envisage
,
but
the
then
minister
be
particularly
tenacious
on
the
issue
.
the
ombudsman
in
she
speech
,
state
that
the
minister
instruct
that
the
scheme
should
go
ahead
but
"
no
doubt
,
in
view
of
the
opposition
of
he
official
and
some
of
the
producer
organisation
....
I
want
to
see
how
we
can
ringfence
six
to
eight
genuine
case
include
that
before
the
high
Court
"
.
on
page
101
of
the
report
,
deputy
Fahey
in
he
response
to
some
of
the
deliberation
state
that
he
use
of
the
word
"
ringfence
"
should
be
interpret
as
he
wish
to
ring
fence
the
scope
of
any
scheme
to
only
genuine
bona
fide
case
.
further
use
of
the
word
"
ringfence
"
,
he
say
,
be
in
response
to
a
note
from
a
person
.
the
impression
here
be
that
really
and
truly
natural
justice
be
not
serve
.
if
it
be
really
design
to
have
a
broad
scope
,
then
the
Byrne
family
would
have
quite
easily
fit
in
under
the
criterion
,
which
as
they
exist
or
be
administer
,
have
be
design
with
certain
individual
potentially
in
mind
.
for
the
purpose
of
understanding
can
I
clarify
the
difference
between
maladministration
and
contrary
to
fair
and
sound
administration
?
I
be
not
be
facetious
in
ask
that
question
,
but
on
page
18
of
the
report
the
ombudsman
refer
to
"
maladministration
"
while
on
page
81
,
in
term
of
the
recommendation
,
it
be
state
that
the
scheme
be
operate
contrary
to
fair
and
sound
administration
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
the
Labour
Party
do
not
seek
to
politicise
this
issue
.
we
seek
at
all
time
to
ensure
the
ombudsman
would
be
afford
a
opportunity
to
appear
before
this
committee
in
a
non-partisan
way
.
I
have
a
conclude
remark
.
the
Ombudsman
,
through
this
report
,
have
endeavour
to
seek
natural
justice
.
deputy
McGinley
have
sum
up
the
argument
in
term
of
the
human
factor
.
nobody
in
this
committee
would
disagree
with
he
that
the
rule
of
equity
and
fairness
,
as
this
scheme
be
devise
,
do
not
apply
to
the
Byrne
family
.
I
hope
that
natural
justice
be
restore
to
this
scheme
and
the
Byrne
family
.
I
also
hope
that
the
Oireachtas
,
in
examine
the
power
of
the
ombudsman
,
would
proceed
with
caution
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
there
should
be
a
reversal
of
the
decision
and
a
recommendation
be
make
which
seek
to
compensate
the
Byrne
family
,
which
I
hope
will
be
the
case
,
then
we
want
to
ensure
that
no
change
be
make
in
haste
which
will
have
we
at
this
juncture
again
,
except
in
a
different
set
of
circumstance
.
I
call
for
caution
.
my
experience
of
the
Ombudsman
's
office
be
that
it
work
well
because
the
assumption
under
which
we
operate
when
we
take
a
case
to
the
ombudsman
be
that
fairness
will
prevail
and
the
decision
be
recognise
as
a
completely
independent
decision
that
all
party
can
accept
.
if
there
be
a
change
of
heart
in
this
case
,
we
should
proceed
with
caution
thereafter
.
that
be
the
point
that
I
be
make
.
we
report
will
be
put
before
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
so
it
will
not
stop
in
the
Department
.
it
will
be
debate
and
we
recommendation
will
be
put
forward
.
this
be
a
fair
and
open
discussion
.
I
thank
the
Ombudsman
and
she
official
for
the
presentation
and
for
answer
we
question
.
by
she
frankness
,
she
have
enhance
the
office
and
I
be
delighted
that
ours
be
the
first
committee
she
appear
before
.
perhaps
a
arrangement
could
be
put
in
place
whereby
a
presentation
be
make
to
the
Oireachtas
annually
.
we
will
discuss
that
when
the
chairman
return
and
make
a
recommendation
to
the
committee
on
procedure
and
privilege
.
we
intend
to
invite
the
minister
and
the
appropriate
official
from
the
Department
,
and
deputy
Fahey
,
as
former
minister
,
to
further
meeting
on
this
issue
and
to
report
to
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
in
due
course
.
we
report
will
be
put
before
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
so
it
will
not
stop
in
the
Department
.
it
will
be
debate
and
we
recommendation
will
be
put
forward
.
this
be
a
fair
and

.
I

I
wish
to
speak
on
the
issue
of
advertising
and
the
ombudsman
's
conclusion
in
this
regard
.
first
,
I
ask
deputy
Fahey
to
address
conclusion
no.
2
of
the
Ombudsman
's
report
,
on
page
81
,
which
state
:
the
way
the
Lost
at
Sea
Scheme
be
design
be
contrary
to
fair
and
sound
administration
.
the
specific
weakness
in
the
design
process
include
,
lack
of
adequate
research
,
lack
of
thorough
document
analysis
of
the
pro
and
con
of
the
various
criterion
and
a
failure
to
include
provision
for
discretion
in
the
vetting
of
application
.
in
deputy
Fahey
's
own
submission
,
he
quote
from
a
letter
date
3
July
2008
to
the
ombudsman
from
Mr.
Tom
Moran
in
which
it
be
state
:
"
the
objective
and
purpose
of
the
scheme
be
clear
,
transparent
and
unambiguous
"
.
the
deputy
go
on
to
say
:
that
be
the
reason
the
scheme
be
advertise
only
in
the
marine
press
and
the
fishing
organisation
be
consult
and
inform
of
the
scheme
.
the
Byrne
family
have
not
be
involve
in
fishing
since
the
tragic
accident
in
the
early
1980
,
so
they
would
not
have
qualify
for
the
scheme
even
if
they
application
have
be
make
in
time
.
they
would
not
have
qualify
for
the
scheme
,
therefore
,
even
if
they
application
have
be
make
on
time
.
my
question
go
back
to
page
81
where
the
Ombudsman
say
the
advertising
be
inadequate
.
in
conclusion
no.
3
she
state
:
give
that
this
be
a
finite
,
once
-
off
scheme
,
aim
at
a
specific
class
of
individual
the
scheme
be
not
advertise
adequately
.
the
advertising
process
should
have
be
more
thorough
,
comprehensive
and
target
.
in
addition
some
prospective
applicant
be
put
in
a
more
advantageous
position
than
other
as
they
be
write
to
directly
by
the
Department
and
the
minister
to
inform
they
about
the
scheme
...
I
have
always
approach
the
specific
reference
to
advertising
in
the
report
on
the
basis
that
,
ceteris
paribus
,
the
Byrne
family
would
not
reasonably
have
be
in
a
position
because
of
the
tragic
circumstance
to
read
the
marine
press
in
the
intervene
year
.
deputy
Fahey
state
the
scheme
be
properly
advertise
but
I
cannot
tally
how
he
can
justifiably
say
it
be
adequately
advertise
when
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
be
state
some
people
be
put
in
a
advantageous
position
as
a
result
of
the
scheme
.
on
the
one
hand
,
he
be
argue
it
be
advertise
adequately
and
that
all
comer
who
may
have
benefit
from
the
scheme
could
have
benefit
from
it
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
some
people
be
put
in
a
more
advantageous
position
because
as
the
then
minister
he
write
to
specific
person
outline
the
prospective
launch
of
the
scheme
.
the
Ombudsman
also
state
:
with
regard
to
find
number
3
the
former
minister
,
in
respond
to
the
draft
investigation
report
,
object
,
inter
alia
,
to
the
suggestion
that
he
be
responsible
for
the
advertising
campaign
.
he
say
that
this
be
a
matter
for
the
civil
servant
in
the
Department
.
have
say
that
,
he
also
express
the
view
that
the
advertising
campaign
be
reasonable
and
satisfactory
.
perhaps
this
be
a
incongruous
issue
but
I
would
like
this
clear
up
.
from
a
layman
's
perspective
,
if
I
make
a
complaint
to
the
Ombudsman
and
I
look
at
this
objectively
,
I
would
have
see
that
the
minister
of
the
day
inform
certain
person
prior
to
the
launch
of
the
scheme
and
if
I
be
a
complainant
,
I
could
have
argue
that
the
scheme
be
not
adequately
advertise
at
the
time
because
if
I
do
not
read
the
marine
press
,
there
be
no
way
a
prospective
complainant
would
have
know
about
the
scheme
.
I
would
,
therefore
,
have
be
put
at
a
disadvantage
.
the
Ombudsman
's
conclusion
be
unambiguous
in
that
regard
.
what
be
deputy
Fahey
's
response
to
she
conclusion
that
the
scheme
be
"
contrary
to
fair
and
sound
administration
"
?
some
people
be
potentially
put
in
a
advantageous
position
.

deputy
Fahey
need
to
respond
on
this
.
be
that
letter
in
the
report
?
I
be
a
layman
,
not
a
lawyer
,
but
the
English
language
be
something
I
like
to
think
I
can
interpret
fairly
well
.
to
return
to
the
conclusion
,
conclusion
no.
2
of
the
Ombudsman
's
report
be
that
the
way
the
lose
at
sea
scheme
be
design
be
contrary
to
fair
and
sound
administration
.
to
my
mind
,
that
be
to
say
it
be
not
design
in
a
way
that
be
fair
to
anyone
apply
to
the
scheme
.
I
ask
a
specific
question
on
the
advertising
process
.
I
accept
deputy
Fahey
have
state
he
position
in
that
regard
.
how
do
he
respond
to
the
question
I
ask
about
the
fact
that
some
people
be
notify
about
the
launch
of
the
scheme
prior
to
other
?
a
question
mark
arise
because
the
impression
be
give
that
some
people
be
put
in
a
advantageous
position
.
I
surmise
that
the
Byrne
family
would
contend
that
they
be
severely
disadvantage
by
the
make
-
up
of
the
scheme
even
though
the
ombudsman
acknowledge
that
they
do
not
fit
all
of
the
criterion
but
she
be
work
accord
to
the
principle
of
natural
justice
.
Natural
justice
be
well
serve
if
one
's
name
be
Paddy
Mullen
or
Tony
Faherty
but
it
be
not
if
one
's
name
be
Mrs.
Winifred
Byrne
.
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
to
allay
the
concern
of
ordinary
people
.
with
all
due
respect
,
to
what
meeting
do
the
minute
refer
?
it
be
a
contemporaneous
record
take
by
a
colleague
of
deputy
Fahey
.
it
be
not
the
minute
of
a
official
meeting
.
I
know
I
have
limited
time
.
let
we
stick
to
the
ombudsman
's
report
.
be
the
16
owner
notify
then
?
be
it
the
case
that
all
16
be
contact
and
not
just
Paddy
Mullen
and
Tony
Faherty
?
deputy
Fahey
contend
it
be
somehow
coincidental
that
Mr.
Paddy
Mullen
and
Mr.
Tony
Flaherty
happen
to
be
he
constituent
,
because
there
be
16
person
in
total
,
many
of
whom
be
not
constituent
of
he
,
who
also
benefit
from
a
notification
of
the
scheme
.
on
behalf
of
the
joint
committee
I
thank
deputy
Fahey
for

presentation

for
answer

will
not
change
the
position
the

take
in

anticipate

be
enter

by
Mr.

Department
will
attest
to
they
position

I
imagine
the
statement
today
will
reflect
the
position
so
there
will
be
no
change

from
my
perspective

there
be
a
view
that
Mr.
Moran
and
he
official
be
give
a
view
on
a
report
in
which
they
have
no
active
part
in
term
of
the
timeframe
around
when
the
complaint
be
make
.
for
example
,
if
the
report
be
draft
in
November
2008
,
it
could
be
argue
that
Mr.
Moran
and
the
official
appear
before
the
committee
today
have
no
direct
impact
or
no
direct
involvement
in
the
designation
or
design
of
the
scheme
when
it
be
implement
.
for
we
to
get
down
to
the
nut
and
bolt
of
the
culture
that
exist
within
the
Department
at
the
time
,
it
would
be
important
for
we
to
hear
the
view
of
that
official
who
be
actively
involved
in
design
the
scheme
.
we
be
now
get
a
contemporaneous
view
from
Mr.
Moran
and
he
colleague
.
I
have
no
problem
with
that
but
it
should
be
extend
so
as
to
reflect
the
view
of
the
official
who
be
at
the
coalface
when
the
scheme
be
be
design
.
anything
short
of
that
will
leave
this
committee
devoid
of
full
and
frank
assessment
in
term
of
be
able
to
hear
all
the
witness
and
all
the
party
who
be
involved
in
this
vital
issue
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
will
Mr.
Moran
deal
now
with
the
point
we
have
raise
?
I
just
hear
Mr.
Moran
say
that
one
design
a
scheme
from
first
principle
and
then
one
advertise
it
.
my
question
relate
to
the
scheme
and
the
manner
in
which
it
come
about
.
I
be
conscious
of
the
fact
that
Mr.
Moran
be
speak
in
2010
about
a
scheme
which
arguably
he
have
no
involvement
in
design
in
the
first
instance
.
I
be
therefore
ask
question
about
something
that
he
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
answer
.
I
hope
that
he
have
a
view
,
however
,
give
that
he
be
the
voice
of
the
Department
in
this
context
.
on
the
scheme
itself
,
be
it
fair
to
say
that
there
be
strident
attempt
by
official
to
prevent
the
scheme
come
into
existence
in
the
first
place
?
in
term
of
the
design
of
the
scheme
and
when
it
come
into
existence
,
the
Byrne
family
make
they
complaint
and
the
ombudsman
conclude
.
the
Ombudsman
's
report
,
on
conclusion
and
recommendation
,
state
:
in
other
word
,
my
investigation
consider
not
just
the
question
of
whether
the
Byrne
family
meet
the
condition
of
the
scheme
,
but
also
whether
the
design
of
the
scheme
and
the
publication
arrangement
be
factor
in
they
not
qualifying
under
the
scheme
in
the
first
place
.
she
speak
directly
to
the
fact
that
they
may
not
have
meet
some
of
the
condition
of
the
scheme
,
but
the
design
of
the
scheme
,
once
it
come
into
fruition
,
be
flawed
.
Mr.
Moran
,
in
he
correspondence
,
state
that
the
way
in
which
the
scheme
be
advertise
be
such
that
a
fisherman
read
the
fishing
press
be
akin
to
a
farmer
read
the
Irish
Farmers
's
Journal
.
that
be
Mr.
Moran
's
view
in
a
contemporary
sense
,
but
do
he
not
consider
that
the
Byrne
family
may
not
have
have
the
heart
to
look
at
the
fishing
press
in
the
intervene
period
from
when
the
tragedy
happen
and
that
it
be
quite
likely
that
they
would
not
have
have
notice
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
would
not
have
read
the
fishing
press
.
Mr.
Moran
cannot
make
the
assumption
with
100
%
certainty
that
if
they
be
interested
in
fishing
or
if
they
have
a
active
part
in
fishing
,
they
would
have
read
the
fishing
press
.
he
cannot
make
that
assumption
and
no
Department
official
,
past
or
present
,
can
make
that
assumption
.
therefore
,
the
ombudsman
,
in
respect
of
she
view
on
the
advertising
component
of
the
scheme
,
be
vindicate
in
she
position
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
she
acknowledge
that
they
do
not
meet
at
least
two
of
the
criterion
.
what
I
conclude
from
that
be
that
there
be
the
balance
of
two
opinion
,
from
a
objective
point
of
view
,
whether
one
take
the
ombudsman
's
point
of
view
that
the
scheme
be
inadequately
advertise
or
whether
one
take
the
view
,
because
,
as
the
Secretary
General
be
promulgate
here
,
that
there
be
a
close
-
knit
fishing
community
with
a
specialised
press
,
that
there
be
a
clear
assumption
that
everybody
will
read
that
and
be
make
aware
of
the
term
of
a
scheme
when
it
be
so
advertise
.
what
we
be
concerned
with
here
be
the
fact
that
the
Ombudsman
have
a
special
position
in
relation
to
the
query
and
complaint
that
the
average
citizen
make
.
whether
we
take
the
balance
of
the
view
of
the
ombudsman
or
whether
we
take
the
balance
of
the
view
of
the
Secretary
General
,
who
,
arguably
,
have
no
act
or
part
in
the
designation
or
design
of
this
scheme
in
the
first
instance
be
a
matter
of
conjecture
.
however
,
I
speak
to
the
conclusion
the
Ombudsman
make
,
in
point
3
in
she
report
.
it
state
:
give
that
this
be
a
finite
,
once
-
off
scheme
,
aim
at
a
specific
class
of
individual
the
scheme
be
not
advertise
adequately
.
if
we
take
the
weight
that
be
the
Ombudsman
's
office
,
do
we
then
take
in
good
faith
she
conclusion
in
this
respect
if
she
further
state
:
the
advertising
process
should
have
be
more
thorough
,
comprehensive
and
target
.
in
addition
some
prospective
applicant
be
put
in
a
more
advantageous
position
than
other
as
they
be
write
to
directly
by
the
Department
and
the
minister
to
inform
they
about
the
scheme
when
it
be
launch
.
overall
,
the
manner
in
which
the
scheme
be
advertise
be
contrary
to
fair
and
sound
administration
.
that
be
she
conclusion
.
it
be
deem
,
arguably
,
that
she
have
no
vested
interest
.
as
somebody
who
have
no
vested
interest
who
be
look
at
this
objectively
,
do
we
,
if
we
be
not
to
undermine
she
office
,
take
this
in
good
faith
?
I
suggest
that
we
do
.
however
,
if
somebody
,
who
be
,
as
she
state
,
a
prospective
applicant
,
"
be
put
in
a
more
advantageous
position
than
other
as
they
be
write
to
directly
by
the
Department
"
,
do
that
not
put
the
complainant
at
a
disadvantage
?
do
it
put
some
person
to
whom
the
Department
write
in
a
more
advantageous
position
in
respect
of
this
scheme
,
thereby
undermine
the
level
of
fairness
attach
to
the
scheme
?
be
it
the
case
that
,
as
the
Ombudsman
state
,
the
manner
in
which
the
scheme
be
advertise
be
contrary
to
fair
and
sound
administration
?
will
the
chairman
indicate
how
much
time
be
leave
to
I
?
in
deference
to
colleague
,
I
will
leave
it
at
that
.
the
Ombudsman
state
to
the
committee
that
the
Department
have
accept
a
late
application
date
11
April
2003
under
the
scheme
.
she
obtain
the
background
paper
and
state
:
it
appear
that
the
application
be
accept
by
the
Department
on
the
grounds
that
the
complainant
say
he
have
be
in
contact
by
telephone
with
the
Department
on
a
number
of
occasion
before
the
closing
date
but
be
give
incorrect
information
,
which
make
he
decide
at
the
time
that
there
be
no
point
in
submit
a
application
.
the
Department
decide
that
it
would
be
unfair
not
to
accept
he
application
.
I
understand
that
the
application
be
ultimately
unsuccessful
.
there
be
a
double
standard
in
this
regard
.
on
behalf
of
the
joint
committee
,
I
thank
Mr.
Moran
and
he
official
for
they
presentation

answer
the
question

I

I

have
already
have
it
.
a
list
of
the
issue
raise
be
furnish
to
Mr.
Gunning
and
Mr.
Egan
.
I
would
like
the
committee
to
go
straight
to
that
issue
instead
of
revisit
what
be
already
say
about
Coillte
's
operation
and
the
result
for
2009
.
it
would
make
good
use
of
we
time
to
go
to
the
issue
if
that
be
possible
;
there
be
at
least
nine
that
require
answer
.
respectfully
,
I
ask
that
we
do
as
I
suggest
and
that
we
go
straight
to
the
issue
,
adopt
we
normal
format
where
any
question
from
spokesperson
and
then
other
member
be
address
.
we
should
go
straight
to
the
question
.
any
of
the
issue
before
we
on
the
submission
on
figure
will
come
out
as
the
question
be
answer
.
I
thank
Mr.
Gunning
and
Mr.
Egan
for
come
before
the
committee
a
relatively
short
time
after
they
last
submission
.
since
then
,
the
€400
million
facility
be
agree
by
way
of
legislation
at
Christmas
and
the
Irish
Forestry
Contractor
Association
have
appear
before
the
committee
.
there
be
a
inherent
respect
for
the
work
Coillte
do
,
it
be
see
as
a
vital
resource
,
but
there
be
issue
where
question
can
be
ask
,
particularly
about
the
structure
for
the
€400
million
.
on
the
designation
of
Coillte
,
what
be
the
exact
structure
?
be
it
a
semi-State
company
,
a
state
company
or
a
private
company
?
what
department
be
it
vested
in
and
which
minister
do
it
answer
to
?
what
be
its
exact
designation
as
a
company
?
why
do
the
chief
executive
request
a
€400
million
credit
facility
for
financial
restructuring
?
be
it
because
loan
outstanding
have
to
be
restructure
or
because
there
be
short
-
falls
in
financing
arrangement
?
be
there
a
shortfall
in
pension
provision
or
be
the
company
in
financial
difficulty
?
we
have
see
the
2008
and
2009
report
and
the
picture
for
2009
be
not
what
the
body
would
like
it
to
be
.
what
be
the
extent
of
the
difficulty
?
the
Irish
Forestry
Contractor
Association
appear
before
we
and
make
some
serious
allegation
concern
the
standing
sale
.
Mr.
Christy
Nolan
,
who
appear
before
we
on
14
April
,
say
that
in
regard
to
the
2010
ratio
of
standing
sale
,
Coillte
want
to
take
over
most
of
that
sale
and
be
only
put
up
40
%
of
timber
for
standing
sale
to
the
mill
contractor
and
that
it
be
take
over
more
of
the
harvesting
sale
,
which
amount
to
approximately
53
%
.
he
state
that
this
will
force
the
mill
contractor
to
tender
against
Coillte
contractor
,
who
be
already
in
dire
strait
.
he
claim
to
have
be
inform
by
the
mill
that
Coillte
have
take
up
to
100000
cubic
metre
off
the
system
for
optimisation
,
which
he
believe
be
another
means
of
get
control
of
more
of
the
harvesting
on
its
condition
.
I
be
not
say
I
agree
with
that
but
I
would
like
to
see
that
allegation
answer
by
Coillte
.
we
want
to
get
a
true
picture
of
where
the
issue
of
standing
sale
stand
at
present
.
there
be
a
perception
that
have
be
express
to
we
that
there
be
depletion
of
long
-
standing
staff
in
favour
of
sub-contractor
.
there
be
a
perception
that
contractor
do
not
have
a
stake
in
forestry
management
in
the
same
way
as
the
exist
staff
and
,
through
the
depletion
in
number
there
have
be
a
diminution
in
the
standard
in
term
of
replant
,
thinning
and
other
issue
.
as
somebody
who
know
very
little
about
forestry
,
I
have
to
say
that
when
I
walk
in
the
Ballyhouras
I
get
a
sense
of
depletion
and
that
replanting
be
not
as
vigorous
as
it
might
have
be
.
I
do
not
know
if
that
be
the
case
or
reflect
the
rest
of
the
country
but
I
would
like
to
see
the
point
answer
.
the
question
be
also
raise
by
Mr.
Nolan
about
Coillte
's
diversification
into
other
product
and
market
.
I
,
for
one
,
would
stand
behind
any
company
that
seek
to
diversify
into
as
broad
a
range
of
area
as
possible
.
it
be
a
good
and
healthy
way
to
do
business
.
however
,
the
idea
of
Coillte
,
which
be
a
forestry
company
,
diversify
into
nursing
home
warrant
some
degree
of
question
.
whether
Coillte
be
seek
to
do
this
to
avail
of
tax
incentive
or
have
a
clear
objective
to
seek
a
return
from
this
type
of
activity
be
open
to
question
.
however
,
the
perception
be
that
there
have
be
diversification
into
such
a
wide
range
of
area
that
it
be
to
the
detriment
of
the
core
business
,
and
that
should
be
address
.
this
be
the
issue
we
want
to
raise
and
which
we
want
to
give
Coillte
a
opportunity
to
address
.
with
all
due
respect
,
the
reason
for
the
legislation
and
the
technical
issue
around
that
be
understand
,
that
be
,
the
fact
that
Coillte
have
to
come
back
on
a
annual
basis
and
seek
the
requirement
.
at
issue
here
be
the
use
to
which
the
borrowing
requirement
be
be
put
,
transparency
in
regard
to
why
a
requirement
of
€400
million
be
be
seek
and
how
that
translate
into
pound
,
shilling
and
pence
in
substantive
term
.
do
Mr.
Egan
not
think
Coillte
be
ill
-
advise
on
the
Medite
acquisition
or
that
it
take
a
short
-
term
view
of
the
matter
give
the
borrowing
requirement
of
€
70
million
?
it
appear
to
I
the
bank
dictate
that
debt
restructuring
would
not
take
place
until
they
be
satisfied
that
the
company
have
a
extend
borrowing
facility
.
what
bank
be
involved
and
what
be
the
nature
of
the
deliberation
?
we
have
enter
a
new
era
of
transparency
in
term
of
the
link
between
the
banking
sector
and
State
company
.
if
a
state
-
own
company
like
Coillte
seek
a
extension
to
its
borrowing
requirement
,
we
would
like
to
know
more
about
the
nature
of
its
relationship
with
the
bank
.
on
a
point
of
order
,
I
refer
to
the
contention
make
by
the
Irish
Forestry
Contractor
Association
in
respect
of
the
2010
ratio
of
standing
sale
.
the
follow
have
be
allege
by
the
forestry
contractor
to
this
committee
.
Coillte
want
to
take
over
most
of
the
standing
sale
and
be
only
put
up
for
40
%
of
timber
for
standing
sale
to
the
mill
contractor
and
be
take
over
more
of
the
harvesting
sale
,
which
amount
to
approximately
53
%
.
this
will
force
the
mill
contractor
to
tender
against
Coillte
contractor
who
be
already
in
dire
strait
.
we
have
be
inform
by
the
mill
that
Coillte
have
take
up
to
100000
cu.
m
off
the
system
for
optimisation
.
we
need
some
concrete
answer
to
this
allegation
.
I
also
pose
a
question
on
the
relationship
with
the
bank
.
I
would
like
to
know
which
bank
Coillte
have
be
deal
with
.
have
it
have
any
dealing
with
Anglo
Irish
Bank
?
do
Coillte
have
a
legal
obligation
to
remove
refuse
that
be
dump
illegally
?
the
company
have
reduce
its
staff
down
to
a
core
group
of
about
500
employee
.
this
mean
that
there
be
not
as
much
of
a
presence
and
if
the
standing
quota
of
staff
be
reduce
,
then
the
company
cannot
be
as
vigilant
on
forestry
management
and
illegal
dumping
.
the
sub
-contractor
will
not
be
vigilant
on
behalf
of
Coillte
in
respect
of
illegal
dumping
.
there
will
have
to
be
a
core
staff
in
certain
sector
that
will
be
able
to
police
illegal
dumping
.
if
this
do
not
happen
,
we
will
not
be
able
to
control
the
tidal
wave
that
follow
.
it
be
get
bad
in
Munster
and
in
my
own
region
.
I
ask
a
question
relate
to
the
bank
.
on
a
philanthropic
and
very
local
issue
,
a
67
year
old
man
live
by
a
forest
pathway
in
north
Cork
,
without
electricity
,
want
to
get
a
electricity
connection
.
he
be
tell
by
Coillte
he
would
have
to
pay
€
80000
for
that
to
be
facilitate
by
the
ESB
.
there
be
toing
and
froing
and
he
be
subsequently
tell
it
would
cost
he
approximately
€
14000
.
this
be
a
man
who
have
live
in
the
forest
all
he
life
,
who
,
late
in
life
have
decide
he
want
to
electrify
he
little
hold
.
he
cannot
pay
€
14000
.
if
there
be
any
way
in
which
Coillte
would
see
its
way
to
facilitate
this
man
in
he
autumn
year
he
would
be
very
grateful
.
I
have
a
note
on
the
detail
that
I
can
pass
to
the
delegate
.
it
would
be
a
major
feather
in
Coillte
's
cap
.
the
ESB
side
be
such
that
the
situation
be
all
square
off
and
it
be
ready
to
go
.
Coillte
be
the
stick
point
.

I

committee
's
question
.
we
need
to
take
cognisance
that
the
Minister
of
State
must
speak
authoritatively
about
the
design
and
promulgation
of
a
scheme
which
predate
he
membership
of
the
House
.
on
one
level
and
with
a
degree
of
equity
,
one
must
recognise
it
be
difficult
for
he
to
speak
with
some
authority
on
the
scheme
's
good
part
and
flaw
several
year
after
it
have
finish
.
have
say
that
,
there
be
nothing
new
in
what
the
Minister
of
State
have
say
today
.
with
respect
to
he
,
I
must
conclude
he
be
follow
the
line
of
he
Department
's
Secretary
General
,
which
he
acknowledge
in
he
open
statement
.
when
the
committee
be
seek
witness
to
the
lose
at
sea
scheme
,
the
obvious
move
be
to
request
the
current
minister
with
responsibility
for
fishery
to
attend
the
committee
.
however
,
it
be
not
surprising
he
have
follow
the
same
line
.
who
among
we
would
not
do
so
in
a
particular
set
of
circumstance
?
the
issue
for
the
Labour
Party
be
whether
this
committee
will
support
the
Ombudsman
's
finding
in
she
special
report
lay
before
the
Oireachtas
that
there
be
maladministration
or
administration
contrary
to
sound
and
fair
principle
of
the
scheme
in
question
.
the
other
issue
be
whether
the
Byrne
family
have
a
legitimate
case
in
they
complaint
about
the
scheme
to
the
ombudsman
.
my
view
,
and
that
of
the
Labour
Party
,
be
that
they
have
a
legitimate
case
.
however
,
it
be
clear
from
the
Minister
of
State
's
submission
he
have
make
up
he
mind
,
along
the
same
line
as
the
Minister
and
the
Secretary
General
,
that
there
be
no
case
to
answer
.
the
government
will
,
therefore
,
run
contrary
to
the
ombudsman
's
view
.
if
the
Oireachtas
be
to
give
due
regard
to
the
Ombudsman
's
independent
role
,
it
must
respect
the
finding
of
any
report
she
lay
before
the
House
.
if
any
citizen
be
to
have
confidence
in
make
a
complaint
to
the
ombudsman
,
the
right
option
be
for
the
Oireachtas
to
accept
she
finding
,
the
independence
of
she
office
and
move
on
.
deputy
Bobby
Aylward
take
the
chair
.
that
may
be
the
case
but
I
have
hear
nothing
today
from
the
Minister
of
State
to
suggest
there
have
be
any
shift
in
the
government
's
position
.
instead
,
all
I
have
see
be
a
further
entrenchment
of
its
position
as
to
how
it
propose
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
I
do
not
but
I
be
entitled
to
use
my
time
.
I
do
not
believe
my
ask
question
would
serve
any
purpose
today
.
I
have
ask
every
possible
question
on
this
matter
over
the
past
several
day
.
I
do
not
believe
the
Minister
of
State
be
go
to
add
anything
further
to
what
be
know
already
.
with
all
due
respect
,
it
do
not
matter
what
the
committee
decide
.
ultimately
,
the
decision
rest
with
the
government
and
the
minister
have
already
make
he
case
.
even
if
the
committee
decide
to
support
unanimously
the
Ombudsman
's
report
,
it
be
clear
from
the
Minister
of
State
's
statement
today
that
the
government
have
already
decide
its
position
.
let
we
call
a
spade
a
spade
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
presentation
to
the
committee
and
for
answer
question
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of

I
thank

for

presentation

.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
he
presentation
to
the
committee
and
for
answer
question
.
I
welcome
the
gentleman
appear
before
the
committee
.
in
regard
to
the
funding
stream
,
what
be
the
net
financial
position
for
Bord
to
gCon
which
include
the
horse
and
greyhound
fund
of
€
11.8
million
,
the
€
5.5
million
which
be
plough
back
in
,
and
the
delegation
state
that
it
receive
€
6.2
million
directly
from
off
-
course
bookmaker
at
the
end
of
the
year
?
my
second
question
relate
to
what
I
would
regard
as
some
degree
of
semantics
be
employ
by
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Heritage
and
local
Government
in
respect
of
litter
.
in
regard
to
point
20
of
its
submission
,
will
the
delegation
outline
the
permutation
?
the
submission
state
:
this
be
present
as
a
concession
but
be
in
fact
a
folly
of
waste
human
and
financial
resource
.
[
that
be
strong
language
,
it
be
vociferous
and
direct
.
]
I
cannot
see
the
difference
between
the
previously
propose
one
litter
every
12
month
and
the
new
concession
of
a
maximum
of
three
litter
every
36
month
in
term
of
the
ability
of
a
small
breeder
to
earn
a
living
.
I
can
see
the
sense
of
what
the
delegation
be
say
there
.
I
do
not
understand
what
the
minister
be
at
and
perhaps
we
need
to
see
some
common
sense
be
employ
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
I
understand
the
minister
may
have
write
to
the
Taoiseach
outline
some
of
the
concern
and
he
may
have
say
that
part
of
he
justification
be
that
it
will
address
concern
relate
to
situation
where
a
bitch
might
not
fall
pregnant
within
a
12
-
month
period
.
the
minister
say
he
propose
a
minor
modification
to
the
definition
of
a
dog
breeding
establishment
,
allowance
of
three
litter
over
three
year
,
subject
to
veterinary
advice
,
provide
that
the
provision
of
a
maximum
of
six
litter
in
the
lifetime
of
a
bitch
would
be
retain
,
and
,
second
,
that
he
would
alter
the
definition
of
breeding
establishment
and
extend
the
four
-
month
age
threshold
to
six
month
.
he
further
state
that
the
change
of
the
definition
to
six
month
will
allow
further
time
for
owner
of
a
new
bear
litter
of
pup
to
decide
whether
to
sell
or
retain
the
pup
.
he
state
also
that
,
heretofore
,
once
the
pup
reach
four
month
of
age
and
be
capable
of
breed
,
each
bitch
pup
would
have
be
reckonable
for
registration
purpose
and
that
he
amendment
effectively
extend
this
period
to
six
month
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
view
from
Bord
to
gCon
on
that
proposal
because
it
speak
for
itself
.
the
third
issue
relate
to
the
inspection
regime
,
the
person
who
be
envisage
to
be
nominate
as
inspector
.
in
this
regard
the
minister
state
that
to
allay
this
concern
he
propose
to
provide
a
facility
whereby
representative
of
IBG
icc
would
accompany
local
authority
veterinary
inspector
on
they
visit
.
he
also
propose
to
restrict
the
personnel
who
be
authorise
to
issue
a
improvement
order
to
local
authority
veterinary
inspector
.
the
authorisation
process
be
the
nub
of
this
issue
and
the
ability
to
issue
a
improvement
order
to
local
authority
veterinary
inspector
.
be
it
the
view
of
the
delegation
that
it
will
only
be
local
authority
veterinary
inspector
or
could
there
be
other
such
person
as
designate
by
the
minister
who
may
not
have
the
necessary
qualification
,
medical
or
otherwise
to
be
able
to
make
proper
inspection
?
there
be
concern
within
the
industry
particularly
among
small
breeder
and
owner
as
to
how
that
might
pan
out
.
be
there
still
concern
that
animal
welfare
group
could
become
part
of
that
process
and
that
there
be
still
scope
through
ministerial
direction
or
secondary
legislation
to
effect
that
?
there
be
more
working
class
pursuit
.
there
be
nothing
leave
for
I
to
do
only
to
thank
Mr.
Neilan
,
Mr.
McKenna
and
Mr.
Gilbert
for
come
in
here
.
I
thank
they
for
they
insight
on
the
matter
.
unfortunately
,
they
get
side
-
track
on
the
Dog
breeding
Establishments
Bill
2009
,
which
be
go
through
the
house
at
present
.
naturally
,
it
be
go
to
come
up
.
I
would
like
to
see
they
come
back
again
,
as
they
state
.
Bord

have
be
assume

we
have
already
write
to

progress
on

perhaps
we
will
get
the

as
well

delegation
will
come
back
at
a

date
when
we
will
have
another
get

I
welcome
the
departmental
official
.
it
be
not
realistic
to
expect
local
authority
,
in
a
economic
downturn
,
to
police
the
provision
of
the
Control
of
Horse
Act
1996
.
they
can
not
be
expect
to
look
after
wonder
horse
and
to
do
what
be
necessary
to
ensure
the
welfare
of
horse
be
maintain
.
the
problem
be
what
could
be
describe
as
the
informal
horse
sector
where
people
put
horse
onto
land
that
may
be
perceive
to
be
in
public
ownership
.
there
be
no
chance
this
animal
be
microchip
.
local
authority
official
would
have
a
difficult
time
seek
to
identify
the
owner
and
even
if
they
could
find
they
and
be
to
tell
they
that
the
law
state
they
must
have
they
animal
microchip
,
they
would
probably
be
laugh
at
.
I
do
not
want
to
seem
cynical
but
the
notion
of
maintain
a
protocol
be
unrealistic
because
the
resource
be
not
there
to
back
it
up
.
notwithstanding
the
positive
aspiration
of
the
Department
,
the
Farm
Animal
Welfare
Advisory
Council
and
the
animal
welfare
group
,
the
situation
remain
that
horse
be
be
leave
to
wander
on
public
land
and
there
be
no
oversight
in
term
of
how
they
be
treat
.
it
be
very
easy
to
discover
the
owner
of
a
horse
when
that
animal
be
on
privately
own
land
.
the
problem
arise
in
regard
to
the
informal
ownership
structure
that
exist
.
it
be
not
easy
to
police
ownership
of
horse
where
they
be
keep
on
public
land
.
how
do
we
bridge
the
gap
?
be
it
the
case
that
we
need
to
reach
out
to
owner
of
horse
in
the
large
metropolitan
area
to
ensure
,
in
the
first
instance
,
that
they
be
not
ignorant
of
the
law
and
that
they
be
educate
about
animal
welfare
issue
?
the
rate
of
abandonment
of
horse
last
winter
because
of
the
severe
weather
condition
be
disgraceful
.
be
it
time
now
to
build
relationship
with
this
people
?
it
seem
that
the
people
who
own
horse
in
the
large
conurbation
be
not
part
of
any
formal
structure
and
that
no
one
have
approach
they
in
regard
to
put
in
place
a
structure
to
ensure
they
maintain
they
horse
in
a
proper
fashion
.
I
be
interested
in
the
official
's
view
in
this
regard
.
we
be
all
aware
of
the
implication
of
the
Control
of
Horse
Act
,
but
it
do
not
seem
relevant
to
many
horse
owner
in
urban
setting
.
there
be
possibly
a
large
ignorance
of
the
law
in
respect
of
the
obligation
of
owner
and
,
as
I
say
,
I
wonder
how
we
can
bridge
that
gap
.
I
be
interested
to
hear
whether
there
be
idea
within
the
Department
as
to
how
that
can
be
do
and
whether
the
political
impetus
be
there
to
follow
that
through
.
we
must
do
everything
possible
to
ensure
the
welfare
of
horse
in
urban
area
.
how
far
back
in
time
be
the
chairman
go
?
on
a
point
of
order
and
forgive
my
ignorance
,
but
be
deputy
O'Sullivan
suggest
that
a
premium
be
pay
directly
to
owner
to
slaughter
they
horse
because
they
cannot
keep
the
animal
any
long
?
on
behalf
of
the
committee
I
thank
Mr.
Carroll
and
he
official
for
they
presentation
and
for
answer
we
question
.
as
request
by
deputy
Upton
,
we
will
consider
invite
the
minister
and
he
official
or
the
local
authority
before
the
committee
to
talk
about
the
situation
.

it
be
hard
not
to
disagree
with
what
be
contain
in
the
document
in
term
of
the
aspiration
of
the
IFA
in
relation
to
CAP
,
namely
,
support
family
farm
,
maintain
and
support
the
production
base
,
sustainable
grass
base
production
,
response
to
demand
of
consumer
,
EU
equivalence
on
food
safety
and
climate
change
goal
.
it
be
not
often
I
or
this
committee
would
disagree
with
the
IFA
.
there
be
a
sense
that
the
future
of
agriculture
and
this
economy
be
predicate
on
a
strong
agricultural
base
and
that
this
will
form
the
basis
of
the
recovery
we
need
.
I
be
at
variance
with
the
IFA
's
position
in
relation
to
the
preservation
of
the
historical
model
.
I
do
not
believe
the
historical
model
as
the
IFA
see
it
will
be
preserve
.
I
do
not
believe
there
exist
the
political
will
within
the
European
Union
group
of
member
state
to
preserve
the
historical
model
as
espouse
here
.
I
wonder
if
the
political
reality
be
such
that
the
historical
model
will
not
be
preserve
and
if
this
be
the
IFA
's
negotiating
position
at
this
juncture
—
it
be
still
early
day
.
what
will
be
the
IFA
's
fall
-
back
position
in
the
event
that
there
be
no
political
support
for
the
preservation
of
the
historical
model
?
the
Labour
Party
agree
that
we
must
try
to
preserve
the
envelope
.
of
that
,
there
be
no
question
.
perhaps
Mr.
Bryan
will
clarify
the
follow
for
I
.
I
do
not
understand
how
the
IFA
can
on
the
one
hand
preserve
the
historical
model
and
at
the
same
time
encourage
the
entry
of
new
farmer
into
the
sector
.
I
believe
there
be
a
imbalance
in
this
regard
.
CAP
need
to
be
structure
in
a
way
that
pertain
to
Ireland
and
in
such
a
manner
that
ensure
that
farmer
who
innovate
and
continue
to
push
out
the
boundary
to
grow
they
enterprise
be
reward
.
such
people
be
in
the
main
the
young
generation
of
farmer
who
enter
into
the
sector
in
recent
year
.
I
do
not
wish
to
be
at
variance
with
the
IFA
but
I
be
try
to
open
up
a
debate
on
whether
it
be
realistic
to
assume
the
historical
model
as
we
know
it
which
we
would
like
to
see
preserve
if
the
political
wind
be
blow
against
it
.
the
minister
,
when
address
the
Seanad
,
appear
to
suggest
that
preserve
that
model
of
payment
will
be
a
uphill
battle
for
the
Irish
government
.
I
be
interested
to
hear
the
IFA
's
response
.
I
state
at
the
last
meeting
of
this
committee
attend
by
all
the
farm
representative
that
I
fear
for
the
way
in
which
modulation
might
go
in
that
if
payment
be
to
be
divert
through
pillar
2
,
they
might
be
divert
away
from
directly
benefit
farmer
,
farm
holding
or
primary
producer
,
thus
fall
into
the
black
hole
of
the
leader
group
and
other
such
representative
organisation
,
something
which
I
would
be
against
.
my
party
would
not
countenance
any
situation
whereby
the
farm
effort
in
term
of
primary
producer
would
not
be
directly
fund
.
it
be
easy
for
I
to
proffer
a
argument
that
suggest
the
historical
model
might
be
dead
.
the
question
that
arise
then
be
what
be
the
alternative
.
I
believe
it
be
still
early
day
in
this
regard
.
we
need
a
model
that
ensure
innovation
be
reward
and
there
be
no
income
floor
below
which
any
farmer
or
primary
producer
will
fall
.
there
must
be
a
safety
net
in
place
and
a
floor
below
which
no
producer
will
fall
to
ensure
at
least
a
income
.
I
do
not
know
whether
the
IFA
go
along
with
the
argument
put
forward
by
certain
sector
within
the
farm
lobby
that
we
should
have
a
minimum
payment
for
every
farmer
or
a
per
hectare
minimum
payment
.
however
,
it
be
a
issue
that
need
to
be
examine
.
I
believe
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
and
that
the
Irish
member
of
the
European
Parliament
's
agricultural
committee
will
have
a
major
bear
on
how
this
negotiation
pan
out
in
the
long
run
.
I
be
glad
to
see
that
because
of
the
Lisbon
treaty
,
this
be
the
case
and
that
it
will
not
be
only
a
single
voice
,
namely
,
the
minister
,
who
will
be
negotiate
.
the
co-decision
procedure
allow
mep
to
have
a
strong
say
in
how
CAP
progress
.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
the
farming
organisation
what
will
be
the
alternative
if
the
historical
model
be
to
be
abolish
because
there
be
no
political
support
for
it
.
I
would
like
also
that
we
would
all
buy
into
that
process
and
would
not
be
behind
the
curve
in
relation
to
Ireland
incorporate
.
I
have
be
call
away
.
I
apologise
for
be
rude
and
not
stay
to
listen
to
the
response
to
my
question
.
I
will
read
the
official
report
.
I
thank
the
president
of
the
IFA
,
Mr.
Bryan
,
Mr.
Smith
and
Ms
Dwyer
for
attend
this
meeting
and
for

presentation
.
we
all
have
a
job
to
do
over
the
next
year
or
two
,
and
we
have
to
row
together
from
government
level
to
committee
level
and
on
to
the
level
of
deputy
and
Senator
.
we
have
to
convince
the
power
that
be
that
we
need
the
envelope
,
we
need
as
big
a
envelope
as
we
have
in
the
past
and
we
need
to
maintain
that
.
that
be
we
task
in
the
come
period
.
we
will
keep
in
contact
.
the
IFA
might
put
in
its
submission
in
regard
to
this
report
,
if
it
have
anything
to
add
.
hopefully
,
we
can
all
row
together
and
get
the
conclusion
we
want
.
I
thank
the
witness
once
again
for
attend
and
for
they
presentation

this
be
the
start
of
the
process
,
and
we
will
move

I
apologise
for
my
late
arrival
due
to
travel
up
from
Cork
.
I
note
the
presence
of
Mr.
Louis
Duffy
and
be
sure
that
with
the
number
of
Cork
people
present
,
he
must
feel
this
meeting
be
a
bit
like
a
meeting
of
Cork
County
Council
.
he
be
probably
wonder
why
he
come
so
far
for
it
.
exactly
.
I
note
the
submission
from
Cork
County
Council
and
will
speak
on
that
,
but
there
be
no
point
in
I
address
the
submission
of
other
local
authority
because
the
only
one
on
which
I
can
speak
with
some
authority
be
the
Cork
one
.
the
question
face
we
be
whether
,
if
the
come
winter
be
similar
to
that
of
last
year
,
we
will
see
similar
abandonment
of
horse
as
happen
last
year
.
there
be
no
evidence
to
suggest
matter
will
be
any
different
this
come
winter
.
we
cannot
lay
the
blame
at
the
door
of
the
local
authority
because
they
be
do
everything
they
can
to
try
to
alleviate
the
problem
.
the
issue
be
how
to
ensure
responsible
ownership
.
the
type
of
horse
abandon
in
north
Cork
in
particular
be
the
typical
piebald
horse
.
a
question
arise
,
therefore
,
as
to
whether
member
of
the
Traveller
community
adequately
ensure
they
horse
be
identifiable
in
compliance
with
legislation
.
it
be
fair
to
surmise
,
without
be
racist
or
prejudiced
,
that
this
be
the
problem
.
how
can
we
ensure
everyone
who
own
a
horse
,
no
matter
they
class
,
creed
or
origin
,
comply
with
the
law
on
ownership
of
animal
?
be
microchipping
be
police
?
if
not
,
how
can
it
be
police
and
have
the
state
the
resource
to
police
it
?
I
do
not
believe
in
the
notion
of
give
irresponsible
owner
a
slaughter
premium
so
that
they
can
create
another
market
.
person
must
take
responsibility
for
the
animal
they
have
purchase
from
day
one
and
now
that
there
be
a
excess
supply
of
horse
,
they
or
other
should
not
benefit
from
slaughter
premia
to
get
rid
of
the
problem
.
we
need
to
tackle
the
issue
and
find
some
mechanism
to
ensure
horse
will
be
traceable
from
birth
and
that
owner
can
be
readily
identify
.
where
such
horse
be
abandon
,
punitive
measure
should
be
take
against
the
owner
without
prejudice
.
I
suspect
the
pound
operate
by
Cork
County
Council
in
Carrignavar
will
be
full
again
this
year
,
despite
this
discussion
,
unless
the
government
take
control
of
and
grapple
with
the
issue
once
and
for
all
.
again
,
I
thank
witness
very
much
.
again
,
I
thank
witness
very
much
.
I
too
welcome
the
commissioner
.
it
be
heartening
to
see
he
and
to
hear
he
view
.
it
be
important
that
we
hear
that
view
and
that
he
get
some
sense
of
the
Irish
position
.
I
be
a
member
of
the
Labour
Party
,
which
be
on
the
left
,
and
it
should
be
worth
note
that
we
party
would
take
the
view
that
the
envelope
must
be
preserve
if
possible
.
the
justification
for
that
be
that
if
there
be
a
growth
in
the
global
population
from
6
billion
to
9
billion
between
now
and
2050
,
depend
on
which
figure
one
believe
—
it
be
a
massive
rate
of
growth
nonetheless
—
then
the
challenge
for
the
European
Union
bloc
will
be
to
feed
itself
and
to
export
.
we
import
approximately
€
78
billion
in
food
import
,
therefore
it
seem
to
I
that
the
logical
position
,
notwithstand
the
economic
downturn
we
face
at
the
current
time
,
be
that
we
must
ramp
up
investment
in
ensure
that
we
can
have
a
market
for
foodstuff
and
that
we
can
guarantee
that
we
avoid
the
food
scarcity
the
commissioner
speak
about
.
the
Irish
model
of
agriculture
be
one
whereby
the
public
goods
be
build
in
,
in
the
sense
of
the
quality
of
the
output
and
much
work
have
be
do
in
recent
year
in
regard
to
environmental
measure
and
so
on
.
I
be
encourage
by
what
the
Commissioner
say
regard
direct
payment
when
he
say
they
be
crucial
and
that
it
will
be
a
evolution
and
not
a
revolution
.
there
be
concern
here
,
particularly
when
we
face
such
a
massive
deficit
in
the
public
finances
,
that
if
there
be
a
major
retrenchment
in
the
agricultural
model
or
agrifood
sector
,
it
could
further
undermine
a
area
where
there
be
great
potential
for
growth
.
if
we
look
at
theburgeoning
Asian
middle
class
,
where
certain
taste
have
develop
,
we
be
well
place
to
meet
significant
demand
for
food
export
.
we
need
the
assistance
,
however
,
to
carry
out
that
multiplier
and
if
there
be
retrenchment
in
the
envelope
,
it
could
impede
we
prospect
.
we
be
mindful
that
the
Commissioner
face
challenge
with
we
eastern
European
neighbour
.
they
will
be
irone
out
in
due
course
but
if
we
be
talk
about
global
food
scarcity
and
the
massive
increase
in
global
population
,
if
we
can
preserve
the
envelope
,
we
will
be
well
place
to
benefit
and
to
add
value
to
the
EU
bloc
.
I
thank
the
Commissioner
and
he
official
and
also
the
minister
,
deputy
Brendan
Smith
,
and
he
official
for
they
attendance
.
I
welcome
the
delegation
and
I
acknowledge
the
presence
of
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
Enterprise
,
Trade
and
Innovation
,
deputy
Calleary
.
I
will
deal
with
the
budget
of
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority
for
2009
to
2010
.
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority

the
Joint
Committee
on
economic
Regulatory
affair
on
13
October
2009
.
in
the
course
of
that
meeting
Mr.
O'Halloran
outline
the
budget
figure
.
this
year
the
budget
of
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority
be
€
22.6
million
,
which
be
€
1.8
million
less
than
at
the
start
of
2008
.
base
on
current
employment
level
,
this
equate
to
approximately
€
10.80
per
worker
per
year
.
that
be
the
level
of
cost
to
the
State
of
provide
the
Health
and
Safety
Authority
.
some
€
13.5
million

,
€
1.2
million
to

,
and
€
1
million
to
travel
and
subsistence
.
have
there
be
a
further
reduction
in
the
HSA
's
budget
for
2010
?
what
be
the
breakdown
for
all
of
this
area
?
as
a
result
of
the
major
downturn
in
the
construction
industry
have
there
be
a
reallocation
of
resource
and
funding
to
other
area
such
as
farm
safety
?
I
wish
to
put
this
question
first
of
all
and
,
beg
the
Chairman
's
indulgence
,
I
will
put
some
more
question
afterwards
.
however
,
I
would
prefer
to
get
the
answer
to
that
first
,
if
possible
.
I
beg
the
chairman
's
indulgence
on
this
.
I
wish
to
drill
down
into
the
figure
somewhat
vis-à
-
vis
the
HSA
.
we
all
buy
into
the
strategy
of
the
farm
safety
action
plan
2009
-
2012
.
we
all
realise
that
all
the
stakeholder
be
involved
.
however
,
we
be
unable
to
see
a
significant
dent
in
the
figure
over
a
historical
period
.
perhaps
I
be
incorrect
in
this
regard
.
let
we
consider
the
figure
for
the
hsa
in
2008
.
there
be
expenditure
of
€
1.2
million
for
information
provision
,
€
1
million
for
travel
and
subsistence
,
and
€
2.2
million
for
accommodation
.
the
question
arise
whether
some
of
this
resource
should
now
be
reallocate
into
Teagasc
or
the
farm
organisation
through
some
newly
-
design
programme
to
ensure
there
be
great
stakeholder
involvement
by
the
farm
organisation
with
regard
to
reduce
the
number
of
fatality
and
accident
.
I
be
not
convinced
that
there
be
a
sufficient
allocation
of
resource
by
the
hsa
.
the
HSA
claim
it
will
increase
inspection
from
1700
to
3000
next
year
but
there
be
only
five
inspector
.
I
surmise
that
five
inspector
have
always
be
there
.
have
there
be
a
increase
in
the
number
of
inspector
attribute
to
this
function
?
it
be
a
fairly
significant
leap
to
get
from
1700
to
3000
.
it
be
no
harm
for
we
to
question
this
figure
within
the
committee
if
the
major
aim
of
everyone
be
to
try
to
get
the
number
of
accident
down
.
I
seek
a
response
to
this
point
.
okay
.
chairman
,
I
ask
other
question
.
I
ask
about
the
budget
and
the
possible
diversification
of
the
budget
.
I
ask
about
the
breakdown
of
the
hsa
budget
which
be
€
22.6
million
.
we
be
pay
€
2.2
million
for
accommodation
,
€
1.2
million
for
information
provision
and
€
1
million
in
travel
and
subsistence
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
budget
now
,
give
that
there
have
be
a
remarkable
reduction
in
the
construction
industry
?
be
the
hsa
stand
over
a
figure
of
€
1
million
for
travel
and
subsistence
?
the
number
of
farm
death
do
not
appear
to
have
be
reduce
dramatically
.
out
of
a
total
of
40
fatality
across
all
sector
,
the
figure
for
farming
be
23
.
where
be
the
bang
for
the
buck
in
that
?
with
all
due
respect
,
I
do
not
want
blasé
answer
.
I
appreciate
that
response
and
I
think
the
more
frank
response
help
I
as
a
member
of
the
committee
.
I
have
ask
also
about
the
statistical
range
.
be
the
number
of
farm
fatality
above
the
European
average
?
I
ask
also
whether
we
should
be
divert
some
of
the
budget
into
Teagasc
which
have
a
direct
involvement
and
interaction
with
farmer
on
the
ground
.
should
that
issue
be
explore
?
be
the
reduction
in
the
number
of
adviser
not
a
function
of
government
policy
?
be
the
deputy
not
a
member
of
the
government
party
?
I
join
in
thank
the
contributor
.
I
assume
there
have
not
be
a
update
study
from
UCG
on
recent
accident
trend
and
farmer
health
statistic
.
look
at
the
figure
,
it
would
stand
to
reason
that
a
high
professional
such
as
a
lawyer
be
infinitely
less
likely
to
have
a
accident
than
a
farmer
or
a
unskilled
manual
labourer
.
be
there
anything
in
the
figure
that
throw
light
on
the
subject
?
the
presentation
contain
reference
to
the
percentage
of
recent
accident
trend
.
for
2008
to
date
it
refer
to
a
value
of
50
for
vehicle
and
machinery
and
between
2001
and
2007
the
figure
be
43
.
how
do
delegate
interpret
this
figure
?

would

if

be
allow
to
put
question
on

section
of
the
report
to
which
Professor
Boyle
have
just
refer
?
would
it
be
appropriate
to
deal
with
the
report
on
a
section
by
section
basis
?
I
thank
Professor
Boyle
and
Dr.
Hennessy
for
come
before
we
.
there
be
a
clear
message
be
send
to
the
committee
-
via
the
statement
present
by
Professor
Boyle
-
in
respect
of
the
advisory
service
.
the
question
that
arise
be
whether
a
properly
fund
state
advisory
service
should
remain
in
place
or
a
privatise
model
should
be
adopt
.
a
political
challenge
arise
in
that
regard
.
we
must
take
cognisance
of
the
fact
that
if
we
be
to
achieve
the
target
relate
to
food
harvest
2020
,
a
strong
advisory
service
will
be
require
.
such
a
service
be
already
in
place
at
Teagasc
.
as
already
state
,
there
be
a
challenge
to
be
meet
and
we
must
be
aware
of
it
.
the
position
be
self
-
explanatory
in
that
sense
.
I
thank
deputy
Edward
O'Keeffe
.
I
do
not
need
a
pat
on
the
head
.
this
be
what
I
call
progress
.
from
we
perspective
we
be
begin
to
drill
down
into
the
food
harvest
2020
report
and
recognise
the
challenge
face
we
arise
from
it
.
as
we
see
it
,
we
have
set
ourselves
political
target
which
in
themselves
present
serious
challenge
.
the
challenge
have
be
summarise
,
but
the
question
that
come
to
my
mind
relate
to
the
improve
restructuring
of
land
.
from
the
research
I
have
carry
out
,
the
number
of
farm
have
decrease
from
223000
in
1980
to
170000
in
1991
to
128000
in
2007
.
the
average
farm
size
have
increase
to
32.3
hectare
.
if
we
be
to
achieve
the
economy
of
scale
necessary
to
achieve
the
target
,
then
obviously
,
as
state
in
the
submission
,
there
must
be
a
improve
restructuring
of
land
.
the
question
that
follow
be
whether
there
be
recognition
by
farm
owner
or
land
owner
as
to
the
need
to
restructure
the
land
.
if
that
restructuring
be
to
take
place
,
how
will
it
take
place
?
will
it
take
place
through
farm
partnership
or
some
type
of
collectivisation
?
I
do
not
mean
that
in
a
load
political
sense
of
the
word
.
be
we
talk
about
people
sell
they
holding
to
achieve
that
economy
of
scale
?
will
the
traditional
family
farm
-
which
be
a
emotive
term
-
as
we
know
it
cease
to
exist
to
achieve
that
target
that
be
necessary
?
the
next
question
be
how
do
one
get
farmer
to
take
up
new
technology
to
achieve
the
efficiency
and
the
return
that
be
necessary
.
if
the
demographic
be
old
and
the
age
profile
be
old
now
,
how
do
we
achieve
a
great
throughput
of
young
farmer
who
be
more
inclined
to
take
up
the
challenge
than
the
more
traditional
farmer
?
perhaps
I
be
wrong
-
perhaps
old
farmer
be
more
open
minded
to
scientific
knowledge
.
my
perception
be
that
the
old
one
be
and
the
long
one
be
in
the
sector
,
the
more
traditional
be
the
individual
's
output
and
the
less
likely
one
be
to
take
on
board
new
technology
to
improve
one
's
holding
.
there
be
a
great
many
challenge
.
what
I
be
drive
at
be
whether
there
be
a
view
in
Teagasc
as
to
how
this
target
can
be
achieve
in
practice
.
what
be
the
political
input
and
what
decision
need
to
be
take
by
policy
maker
with
a
view
to
achieve
this
target
?
I
be
a
regular
reader
of
the
Teagasc
magazine
Today
's
Farm
.
I
find
it
invaluable
and
the
T
research
document
that
come
out
on
a
regular
basis
be
invaluable
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
.
in
one
article
on
greenhouse
gas
in
the
current
edition
where
Mark
Gibson
,
the
environment
specialist
in
Athenry
talk
about
the
international
research
.
he
state
that
international
research
have
establish
that
the
fair
and
most
accurate
way
of
measure
greenhouse
gas
emission
be
on
a
per
unit
product
basis
so
that
for
example
total
greenhouse
gas
emission
from
a
litre
of
milk
or
a
kilogramme
of
meat
by
reduce
the
carbon
footprint
of
we
produce
would
enable
all
country
to
compete
on
a
level
playing
pitch
and
work
towards
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emission
from
global
agriculture
.
if
I
track
back
from
there
as
a
layman
,
the
question
be
what
research
be
go
on
,
how
be
the
multidisciplinary
internal
working
group
work
at
the
moment
to
achieve
that
target
and
be
there
something
concrete
arise
from
it
that
will
feed
into
the
end
game
or
the
target
set
out
in
food
harvest
2020
,
to
which
we
all
subscribe
at
some
level
.
greenhouse
gas
,
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
,
be
one
of
the
major
challenge
and
I
know
there
be
a
great
deal
of
work
go
on
in
Moorepark
on
that
issue
.
that
be
well
recognise
and
well
establish
.
the
question
be
whether
we
will
achieve
the
target
and
where
be
we
scientifically
in
that
sense
.
I
will
make
a
brief
point
and
I
accept
that
it
be
somewhat
tangential
in
nature
.
I
refer
to
carbon
leakage
and
the
issue
raise
in
Mr.
Mark
Gibson
's
article
in
Today
's
Farm
.
the
question
that
arise
for
many
people
outside
the
committee
be
whether
we
should
reduce
the
number
in
the
national
herd
.
my
view
be
that
,
particularly
for
economic
reason
,
we
should
not
do
so
.
there
be
also
a
scientific
opinion
which
indicate
that
,
because
of
carbon
leakage
,
we
should
not
do
so
.
will
Dr.
Hennessy
provide
a
brief
outline
regard
how
Teagasc
define
carbon
leakage
?
I
thank
Dr.
Hennessy
.
when
I
ask
to
speak
about
the
artisan
food
sector
issue
,
I
want
to
get
a
sense
of
whether
there
be
a
formal
structure
within
Teagasc
and
the
sector
.
I
be
not
sure
what
the
exist
structure
be
and
my
question
be
answer
.

I
thank

I
support
my
colleague
deputy
Upton
.
the
State
can
no
long
justify
a
fund
or
subvention
of
€
26.3
million
,
especially
when
we
can
,
in
this
era
of
advanced
technology
,
capture
funding
easily
in
a
online
setting
.
we
contend
that
if
one
can
raise
€
90
million
through
online
and
off
-
line
activity
at
a
tax
rate
of
1.5
%
,
one
be
create
a
level
playing
pitch
.
this
be
because
one
be
not
penalise
bookmaker
such
as
Mrs.
Bambury
in
Mallow
,
a
independent
bookmaker
who
do
not
have
a
online
presence
.
she
have
be
put
at
a
disadvantage
relative
to
Celtic
Bookmaker
,
Paddy
Power
and
all
the
major
entity
which
can
operate
online
and
create
company
abroad
in
Gibraltar
and
such
place
for
taxation
purpose
.
consider
that
the
IMF
have
already
be
to
this
shore
,
one
cannot
argue
that
the
Exchequer
must
now
fund
the
industry
with
another
€
26.3
million
.
I
be
a
greyhound
owner
and
hail
from
the
town
of
Mallow
which
have
a
proud
tradition
of
racing
.
in
anticipation
of
deputy
Edward
O'Keeffe
's
contention
about
Youghal
,
I
have
a
dog
run
there
a
couple
of
week
ago
and
,
therefore
,
know
the
value
of
that
location
.
if
there
be
sufficient
political
will
,
we
could
capture
million
of
euro
in
a
online
setting
.
it
have
not
be
sufficient
heretofore
.
the
Labour
Party
,
include
deputy
Upton
,
have
much
forbearance
in
this
regard
.
we
have
now
create
a
policy
that
allow
the
government
to
get
off
the
hook
and
take
on
the
large
player
in
the
betting
industry
such
that
it
can
capture
funding
that
will
,
in
turn
,
fund
the
industry
.
one
could
increase
the
number
of
job
in
the
industry
above
the
current
number
,
27000
.
to
do
this
,
however
,
one
must
think
more
laterally
.
that
be
the
logic
of
the
Labour
Party
's
argument
and
why
I
support
deputy
Upton
.
if
we
be
sufficiently
brave
and
bold
,
there
be
no
reason
we
cannot
tackle
online
betting
.
the
potential
be
massive
and
nobody
will
convince
I
that
one
cannot
capture
the
online
market
.
I
do
not
know
whether
tinker
around
with
legislation
be
sufficient
.
do
one
place
a
onus
on
the
industry
to
capture
the
funding
or
place
a
onus
on
the
Exchequer
?
I
would
be
happy
to
hear
the
minister
or
he
official
talk
about
how
the
system
operate
in
other
country
where
what
I
propose
have
be
achieve
.
to
what
extent
have
the
minister
explore
the
issue
of
online
capture
from
a
technical
point
of
view
?
while
I
acknowledge
the
reference
to
the
French
model
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
we
have
no
choice
but
to
pursue
online
betting
.
if
we
do
not
,
the
industry
will
falter
in
a
situation
where
it
will
remain
reliant
on
the
Exchequer
.
what
technical
advance
have
be
make
in
this
regard
?
to
whom
in
the
industry
be
the
department
talk
in
term
of
such
capture
?
be
it
only
a
legislative
change
that
be
necessary
?
will
the
onus
be
place
on
the
industry
to
capture
its
own
fund
or
will
the
state
be
responsible
?
it
be
easy
to
quantify
the
number
of
bet
in
a
online
setting
.
likewise
,
it
be
not
difficult
to
ascertain
how
much
be
be
bet
on
exchange
and
so
on
.
exchange
which
be
currently
exempt
from
tax
should
also
be
part
of
the
capture
.
there
be
a
somewhat
nefarious
system
,
whereby
operator
,
by
form
exchange
,
exempt
themselves
from
payment
of
the
betting
tax
.
the
bottom
line
be
that
the
State
need
this
revenue
capture
and
that
the
very
future
of
the
industry
depend
on
go
after
online
betting
.
I
be
neither
a
technophile
nor
a
technophobe
,
but
I
would
like
to
know
who
in
the
State
agency
be
talk
the
language
of
online
capture
from
a
technical
point
of
view
.
can
the
meeting
resume
after
the
vote
?
member
must
return
after
the
vote
in
the
Dáil
.
we
dissent
from
that
position
.
the
Labour
Party
believe
there
have
be
more
than
enough
time
for
the
government
to
seek
to
get
a
online
capture
and
to
expand
that
capture
's
remit
.
it
be
not
fair
to
other
taxpayer
that
the
government
would
now
seek
to
extract
the
€
26.3
million
.
we
strongly
believe
that
this
amount
could
be
obtain
through
other
means
.
on
this
basis
,
we
oppose
the
procedure
.
we
oppose
the
motion
.
on
behalf
of
the
Labour
Party
,
I
wish
the
Chairman
,
member
,
the
minister
,
he
staff
,
he
colleague
and
the
secretariat
a
happy
Christmas
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
forbearance
throughout
the
year
.
I
also
thank
he
staff
and
colleague
for
all
of
they
hard
work
and
great
co-operation
.
they
be
helpful
at
all
time
.
I
wish
the
minister
well
.

I
welcome
Mr.
Moran
and
he
colleague
to
the
joint
committee
.
I
want
to
address
the
issue
of
the
special
share
.
what
be
the
distinction
between
a
special
share
and
a
golden
share
?
the
suggestion
by
Mr.
Moran
be
that
the
decision
to
cease
production
be
lay
firmly
and
squarely
at
Greencore
's
door
,
and
neither
the
Department
nor
the
government
of
the
day
have
any
input
into
that
decision
because
the
quota
be
own
by
Irish
Sugar
.
my
understanding
of
the
import
of
the
special
share
be
that
it
be
hold
by
the
government
.
it
have
the
same
monetary
value
as
any
other
share
,
but
condition
be
attach
which
mean
that
Greencore
could
not
dispose
of
the
control
interest
in
Irish
Sugar
without
the
prior
consent
of
the
minister
of
the
day
.
the
former
minister
,
Mr.
Michael
Smith
,
tell
the
Dáil
at
the
time
that
the
special
share
in
Greencore
do
not
allow
the
minister
,
act
on
behalf
of
the
State
,
to
contribute
to
the
decision
make
by
Greencore
on
the
renunciation
of
the
quota
.
the
propose
action
by
Greencore
,
which
require
the
minister
's
consent
under
the
term
associate
with
the
special
share
,
be
related
to
any
change
to
certain
specify
article
of
the
article
of
association
-
the
voluntary
wind
up
of
Greencore
,
the
sale
of
more
than
49
%
of
Irish
Sugar
plc
,
a
subsidiary
of
Greencore
,
and
the
creation
of
a
new
class
of
share
in
Greencore
.
legal
advice
obtain
at
the
time
be
that
they
do
not
include
provision
for
the
minister
to
direct
Greencore
in
regard
to
the
sugar
quota
.
Greencore
be
the
holder
of
the
entire
Irish
sugar
quota
.
Irish
Sugar
,
Cómhlucht
Siúcre
Éireann
Teoranta
,
predate
the
foundation
of
the
European
Union
and
Ireland
's
accession
to
the
European
Union
in
1973
.
it
be
set
up
by
the
State
as
a
State
company
.
for
the
life
of
I
,
I
do
not
understand
the
mechanism
in
regard
to
the
golden
or
special
share
.
the
Irish
people
and
polity
reasonably
understand
that
the
basis
of
that
share
be
such
that
it
would
be
hold
in
perpetuity
for
the
people
and
that
it
would
have
,
by
its
very
nature
and
character
,
conveyance
of
certain
power
for
the
people
.
we
have
be
tell
by
the
Secretary
General
and
the
minister
that
be
not
the
case
and
that
be
so
relinquish
.
therefore
,
the
import
,
or
net
result
,
of
that
be
that
it
be
hand
over
lock
,
stock
and
barrel
to
a
corporate
entity
which
could
do
whatever
it
want
to
do
,
that
the
State
,
once
it
reach
a
decision
in
regard
to
the
negotiation
on
the
overhaul
of
the
sugar
regime
,
have
no
power
or
effect
whatsoever
and
that
a
corporate
entity
,
Greencore
,
have
the
ultimate
power
in
term
of
renounce
the
quota
.
to
my
mind
,
that
be
nothing
short
of
national
sabotage
.
what
it
signal
be
that
the
government
of
the
day
literally
hand
over
a
industry
which
have
be
here
since
the
1920s
and
which
be
found
by
Irish
man
and
woman
for
the
people
.
it
be
effectively
hand
over
to
a
corporate
entity
,
the
likes
of
which
pay
some
of
its
representative
the
sum
of
€
4.6
million
last
year
.
the
four
top
executive
in
Greencore
,
the
food
group
,
take
home
a
cumulative
€
4.56
million
last
year
,
a
rise
of
55
%
.
this
industry
have
be
sell
from
under
the
foot
of
the
people
and
not
even
with
a
bang
but
with
a
whimper
,
to
misquote
the
poet
T.
S.
Eliot
.
that
be
the
past
.
I
hail
from
the
town
of
Mallow
and
believe
there
could
be
potential
but
we
must
be
very
realistic
about
what
we
want
to
achieve
from
this
day
onwards
.
I
would
like
a
straight
answer
to
the
follow
question
.
can
the
State
carry
out
a
feasibility
study
to
ascertain
whether
we
can
start
to
produce
sugar
again
for
its
own
marketability
or
ethanol
in
order
that
we
can
offset
some
of
the
cost
of
importation
of
undenatured
ethanol
from
third
country
like
Brazil
,
which
be
what
we
be
do
?
the
other
inherent
contradiction
be
that
for
€
20
million
or
so
less
,
by
way
of
compensation
to
cover
dismantling
cost
,
the
State
could
have
maintain
the
facility
at
Mallow
.
we
have
be
tell
by
various
expert
that
if
we
be
to
kick
-
start
the
industry
,
it
will
cost
we
€500
million
plus
.
if
we
have
decide
to
retain
the
factory
,
could
the
State
have
state
to
Greencore
that
it
would
take
on
that
facility
for
a
negotiable
sum
in
order
that
the
State
,
as
a
entity
,
could
have
do
what
it
want
with
that
factory
?
the
Oireachtas
recently
pass
the
biofuel
obligation
scheme
.
the
biofuel
obligation
scheme
be
a
transposition
of
a
European
directive
,
which
basically
mean
that
we
must
put
a
certain
percentage
of
biofuel
into
we
petrol
or
diesel
tank
on
a
daily
basis
.
the
irony
of
it
be
that
we
be
import
that
and
Whitegate
and
the
big
oil
company
start
import
undenatured
ethanol
from
third
country
a
number
of
year
ago
in
anticipation
of
the
transposition
of
this
directive
.
when
the
biofuel
obligation
scheme
legislation
come
before
the
Dáil
,
the
Labour
Party
put
forward
amendment
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Ryan
,
to
ask
that
we
would
look
at
impose
a
tariff
on
undenatured
ethanol
import
from
third
country
so
that
we
could
kick
-
start
this
industry
.
the
irony
of
it
be
that
there
be
a
ready
-
make
factory
in
Mallow
which
could
have
take
up
that
slack
to
produce
ethanol
,
either
from
beet
or
from
other
source
,
which
would
meet
that
particular
need
.
that
factory
be
gone
.
it
seem
to
I
that
it
be
gone
because
of
a
lack
of
oversight
,
a
lack
of
foresight
and
a
lack
of
vision
,
which
be
the
same
type
of
vision
which
create
the
Irish
sugar
industry
in
the
first
instance
.
how
will
we
go
back
to
basic
and
what
can
we
do
to
restimulate
this
industry
?
can
we
,
as
a
starting
point
,
bring
all
of
the
stakeholder
together
,
include
government
,
all
of
the
Department
involve
and
the
farming
organisation
,
to
at
least
see
if
the
State
could
fund
the
cost
of
a
feasibility
study
to
see
if
it
be
viable
,
either
for
ethanol
production
or
for
sugar
production
?
we
be
hamper
by
the
fact
that
we
cannot
access
quota
,
and
that
be
a
political
decision
that
have
be
make
.
however
,
for
the
period
after
2015
and
for
long
-
term
planning
-
I
refer
not
to
two
or
three
year
hence
but
to
20
year
down
the
road
when
there
may
be
a
renegotiation
of
the
sugar
quota
and
other
such
quota
-
we
could
put
in
place
some
sort
of
a
feasibility
study
so
that
we
can
start
think
in
the
long
term
about
kick
-
start
a
industry
where
farmer
want
to
grow
the
beet
and
there
be
a
generation
of
worker
out
there
who
be
still
young
enough
to
have
that
knowledge
to
put
together
the
infrastructure
again
.
that
be
the
kind
of
thinking
we
want
to
see
.
there
be
nothing
in
Mr.
Moran
's
statement
that
would
give
I
any
grounds
for
hope
.
effectively
,
he
state
that
it
be
a
commercial
decision
by
the
company
and
that
the
State
abdicate
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
have
relinquish
its
special
share
or
that
special
share
have
no
particular
weight
.
he
also
state
that
it
be
not
possible
to
produce
sugar
for
export
outside
the
EU
and
there
be
no
mechanism
under
the
present
regulation
that
would
allow
for
the
reinstatement
of
the
sugar
quota
for
grow
of
sugar
beet
in
Ireland
.
Mr.
Moran
be
not
give
we
any
grounds
for
hope
today
.
I
want
to
hear
from
Mr.
Moran
,
who
be
arguably
a
key
decision
maker
as
Secretary
General
of
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
which
have
a
massive
budget
in
this
country
.
I
want
to
hear
a
new
kind
of
language
come
from
civil
servant
that
ask
if
we
can
look
at
a
feasibility
study
to
see
if
we
can
kick
-
start
this
industry
.
that
be
the
kind
of
statement
my
party
want
to
hear
in
this
committee
today
.
would
the
Department
consider
engage
with
the
stakeholder
interested
in
put
forward
proposal
or
at
least
consider
have
a
exchange
of
view
with
viable
stakeholder
who
wish
to
kick
-
start
project
?
I
accept
at
face
value
and
in
good
faith
the
offer
make
of
support
with
regard
to
approach
to
Enterprise
Ireland
,
but
will
the
Department
engage
with
stakeholder
on
the
issue
of
the
feasibility
study
?
will
either
the
Secretary
General
or
he
colleague
within
the
Department
become
involved
in
direct
consultation
?
I
thank
the
Secretary
General
and
he
official
for
the
presentation
and
discuss
the
matter
today
.
it
be
a
worthwhile
exercise
.
I
thank
the
Secretary
General
and
he
official
for
the
presentation
and
discuss
the
matter
today
.
it
be
a
worthwhile
exercise
.
I
appreciate
that
Mr.
Coveney
agree
to
appear
before
the
committee
at
the
last
minute
,
give
that
we
be
suppose
to
be
engage
with
Mr.
Odlum
.
I
be
glad
the
head
of
Greencore
be
able
to
attend
.
Mr.
Coveney
's
submission
do
not
pull
any
punch
but
it
would
be
worthwhile
to
investigate
further
the
historical
perspective
.
I
do
not
want
to
dwell
on
this
matter
too
long
because
we
be
most
interested
in
the
future
viability
of
the
industry
and
where
we
can
go
as
a
country
in
regard
to
ethanol
or
sugar
production
.
it
be
important
to
hear
Greencore
's
opinion
on
this
matter
.
from
a
political
point
of
view
,
the
historical
perspective
suggest
that
Greencore
's
version
of
event
be
at
variance
with
that
of
the
Secretary
General
of
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
Fishery
and
food
,
Mr.
Moran
,
who
state
in
he
submission
:
the
decision
to
close
the
Mallow
factory
and
thus
to
cease
sugar
production
,
be
make
by
Greencore
and
Greencore
alone
.
the
government
and
the
Department
do
not
have
any
power
to
prevent
this
.
he
go
on
to
state
that
the
renunciation
of
the
quota
be
in
the
hand
of
Greencore
and
be
a
commercial
decision
in
which
the
government
do
not
play
a
role
.
Mr.
Coveney
state
:
"
in
the
early
day
of
this
discussion
...[
r]
ecognise
that
some
significant
change
be
inevitable
,
Greencore
lobby
hard
at
EU
and
government
level
for
Ireland
to
retain
a
reduce
but
significant
quota
in
a
regime
reform
through
quota
cut
.
"
this
suggest
the
decision
be
political
rather
than
corporate
.
I
seek
clarity
on
this
matter
.
Mr.
Coveney
also
refer
to
Mr.
McConnell
's
report
in
the
Irish
Times
that
grower
be
split
down
the
middle
on
whether
to
seek
a
increase
in
the
base
price
or
opt
for
a
complete
shut
-
down
,
state
:
the
IFA
choose
the
latter
course
of
action
on
behalf
of
its
member
.
it
be
not
a
irrational
response
,
give
the
compensation
potentially
on
offer
to
grower
and
the
practical
difficulty
.
this
be
confusing
because
he
go
on
to
state
:
"
no
grower
have
commit
to
supply
Mallow
by
the
beginning
of
March
2006
for
the
autumn
2006
campaign
.
"
be
that
factually
the
case
?
there
be
a
school
of
thought
which
believe
a
number
of
grower
in
the
Mallow
and
north
County
Cork
area
would
have
be
more
than
willing
to
engage
the
company
if
it
have
not
demolish
its
plant
.
they
intend
to
grow
for
a
further
12
month
and
then
decide
how
the
market
be
perform
.
I
ask
for
clarity
because
it
appear
there
be
disparity
between
the
government
's
position
as
set
out
by
Mr.
Moran
and
what
Greencore
have
argue
today
.
Mr.
Coveney
also
state
that
the
Department
exercise
its
discretion
under
the
new
regime
to
base
the
allocation
of
compensation
to
grower
on
the
2003
-
04
reference
period
without
consult
Greencore
.
what
be
the
nature
of
the
contact
between
Greencore
and
the
Department
or
the
minister
of
the
day
?
it
have
be
suggest
the
decision
to
change
the
regime
be
make
by
the
Council
of
Minister
and
that
the
interaction
with
Greencore
be
subsequent
to
that
fateful
night
in
November
.
I
have
before
I
a
master
plan
for
Mallow
west
which
be
submit
for
consideration
under
the
2006
local
area
plan
.
I
be
the
mayor
of
Mallow
in
2004
and
2005
,
during
which
time
the
issue
of
the
site
's
future
arise
.
we
hesitate
to
support
the
submission
because
the
factory
's
worker
have
not
yet
receive
they
due
entitlement
from
the
compensation
package
.
in
spite
of
what
Mr.
Coveney
have
claim
,
the
perception
of
Greencore
be
very
negative
among
grower
,
worker
and
the
wide
community
because
we
do
not
believe
it
have
a
sense
of
corporate
social
responsibility
to
the
generation
of
worker
and
grower
who
keep
the
factory
go
.
there
be
a
sense
that
Greencore
and
the
sweeping
hand
of
capitalism
be
go
to
make
as
much
as
it
could
from
the
site
.
we
only
agree
to
the
Mallow
west
proposal
in
the
county
development
plan
on
the
basis
that
the
worker
be
compensate
properly
.
the
plan
state
the
Mallow
west
project
would
involve
a
capital
investment
of
€500
million
and
create
a
consumer
spend
of
€
22.7
million
per
annum
,
a
total
of
2000
job
and
a
critical
mass
so
that
Mallow
could
capitalise
on
its
designation
as
a
hub
town
under
the
national
spatial
strategy
.
none
of
that
have
happen
.
as
member
will
imagine
,
the
perception
of
Greencore
in
Mallow
be
very
negative
at
this
stage
.
now
that
a
realistic
proposal
have
emerge
from
the
Irish
bio-fuel
initiative
to
get
something
go
on
some
site
in
Ireland
,
Mr.
Coveney
appear
to
suggest
it
will
not
be
possible
to
produce
sugar
without
subsidy
.
at
the
same
time
,
he
state
that
Greencore
will
not
be
involve
in
sugar
or
ethanol
production
in
the
future
but
be
available
for
assistance
.
what
be
Greencore
's
plan
for
the
site
?
some
of
it
be
rezone
at
we
behest
for
light
industrial
use
.
will
the
company
engage
with
stakeholder
,
such
as
the
Irish
bio-fuel
initiative
,
to
contribute
to
a
viability
study
in
line
with
the
Department
's
offer
of
support
and
,
if
so
,
how
will
it
go
about
it
?
I
suggest
Greencore
have
corporate
social
responsibility
in
this
matter
.
it
have
do
quite
well
out
of
the
process
but
there
be
a
perception
that
it
have
give
nothing
back
to
Mallow
.
perhaps
one
way
of
redress
that
imbalance
would
be
for
it
to
engage
with
people
or
party
who
want
to
develop
that
site
for
industrial
or
commercial
purpose
.
I
hope
this
issue
can
be
address
.
I
have
further
question
which
I
will
ask
on
the
second
round
of
question
if
I
be
permit
.
it
be
Mallow
west
.
to
what
do
Mr.
Coveney
attribute
that
,
if
I
may
ask
?
I
seek
clarification
because
it
be
important
for
the
people
of
north
Cork
.
if
we
can
reach
a
stage
where
Greencore
be
meaningfully
engage
with
the
Mallow
Development
Partnership
or
stakeholder
such
as
the
Irish
Biofuels
Initiative
,
then
we
have
a
starting
point
.
if
such
a
guarantee
could
be
garner
today
with
regard
to
the
Mallow
site
or
other
potential
use
for
the
site
from
a
commercial
or
industrial
point
of
view
through
the
Mallow
Development
Partnership
and
the
Irish
Biofuels
Initiative
,
it
would
represent
a
positive
that
we
could
take
from
today
.
I
refer
to
the
special
share
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
allow
I
back
in
.
on
Thursday
,
11
November
2010
,
there
be
statement
in
the
dáil
on
the
EU
sugar
regime
.
on
that
occasion
the
minister
say
:
...
the
special
share
in
Greencore
do
not
allow
the
minister
,
act
on
behalf
of
the
State
,
to
contribute
to
the
decision
make
by
Greencore
on
the
renunciation
of
the
quota
.
the
propose
action
by
Greencore
that
require
the
minister
's
consent
under
the
term
associate
with
the
special
share
be
related
to
any
change
to
certain
specify
article
of
the
article
of
association
;
the
voluntary
wind
up
of
Greencore
;
the
sale
of
more
than
49
%
of
Irish
Sugar
plc
,
a
subsidiary
of
Greencore
;
and
the
creation
of
a
new
class
of
share
in
Greencore
.
legal
advice
obtain
at
the
time
be
that
they
do
not
include
provision
for
the
minister
to
direct
Greencore
in
relation
to
the
sugar
quota
.
Greencore
be
the
holder
of
the
entire
Irish
sugar
quota
.
my
interpretation
of
that
statement
be
that
the
renunciation
of
the
share
,
accord
to
the
minister
,
rest
firmly
and
squarely
at
the
door
of
Greencore
,
by
virtue
of
the
legislation
,
and
,
therefore
,
the
minister
be
arguably
wash
he
hand
of
any
decision
,
say
it
be
a
corporate
decision
as
oppose
to
a
political
decision
.
where
do
we
go
from
here
?
what
be
the
future
?
I
would
like
to
hear
Mr.
Coveney
's
opinion
on
this
particular
tract
of
the
speech
?
what
be
the
future
?
Greencore
have
clearly
state
here
that
it
have
no
intention
of
get
involved
in
sugar
or
ethanol
production
.
that
be
clear
and
we
can
put
that
issue
to
bed
.
I
would
like
to
get
a
further
sense
of
how
Greencore
will
engage
with
the
stakeholder
.
I
be
aware
that
he
say
early
he
would
not
go
into
the
detail
of
that
but
if
he
can
reaffirm
that
commitment
we
will
take
something
positive
from
this
meeting
.
I
welcome
the
fact
that
some
of
the
statement
make
in
regard
to
sugar
production
in
Ireland
by
Mr.
Coveney
may
be
rebut
at
a
future
meeting
of
committee
by
the
Irish
Biofuels
Initiative
and
possibly
by
Mr.
McCarthy
and
company
.
I
be
glad
from
my
party
's
point
of
view
that
we
have
have
this
consultation
because
it
have
clarify
certain
matter
for
which
I
thank
Mr.
Coveney
.
on
behalf
of
the
committee
I
thank
Mr.
Coveney
for

I
welcome
the
Mr.
Kavanagh
and
he
colleague
to
the
committee
.
the
Labour
Party
issue
a
document
through
deputy
Upton
call
raise
the
Stake
which
raise
similar
aspiration
and
concern
to
that
set
out
by
the
delegate
.
why
do
we
have
a
situation
in
which
celebrity
plug
online
betting
exchange
when
the
evidence
be
clear
they
be
not
contribute
to
the
Exchequer
or
the
prize
money
for
the
very
race
on
which
people
place
they
bet
?
the
challenge
for
the
next
government
will
be
to
go
after
the
online
community
.
it
be
disingenuous
of
the
big
betting
company
,
which
have
a
online
presence
alongside
offshore
accounting
procedure
,
to
expect
the
Irish
taxpayer
will
continue
to
fund
prize
and
allow
they
to
live
off
the
fat
of
the
land
.
I
come
from
Mallow
,
where
Mrs.
Bambury
have
operate
a
bookmaking
operation
through
thick
and
thin
.
I
wonder
how
this
matter
affect
she
give
that
she
do
not
have
a
online
presence
.
she
be
fund
the
prize
money
through
the
levy
while
the
big
operator
be
not
require
to
pay
.
we
need
to
address
that
disparity
.
the
delegate
's
submission
reveal
a
willingness
to
engage
.
if
politician
can
work
with
Horse
Racing
Ireland
,
we
would
be
able
to
reach
a
arrangement
that
allow
for
the
continue
funding
of
the
industry
.
it
have
to
be
fund
by
punter
and
company
as
well
as
taxpayer
.
the
company
will
have
to
stop
hide
under
wonderful
statement
about
the
job
they
be
create
.
I
acknowledge
they
be
create
job
but
they
cannot
use
that
as
a
battering
ram
to
get
away
from
funding
prize
money
.
we
need
to
find
solution
and
in
that
regard
I
welcome
the
submission
as
a
step
forward
.
I
thank
Mr.
Kavanagh
for
the
presentation
and
for
discuss
the
matter
.
I
be
sure
the
new
committee
will
invite
HRI
to
a
full
meeting
because
this
be
a
vital
issue
.
I
be
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
address
the
committee
and
I
be
also
thankful
to
you
,
Chairman
,
and
the
member
of
the
committee
for
the
work
to
date
on
forestry
give
that
it
feed
so
much
into
the
global
agenda
of
climate
action
.
I
think
we
all
agree
on
that
.
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
this
committee
be
give
a
significant
priority
to
forestry
issue
in
a
way
that
I
have
never
witness
in
my
time
here
.
I
have
a
specific
case
that
I
wish
to
raise
.
I
have
refer
it
to
the
Minister
of
State
by
email
.
it
have
be
the
subject
of
parliamentary
question
.
it
be
tfl00177018
.
to
I
,
this
case
be
the
kernel
of
the
issue
as
it
relate
to
application
for
felling
licence
.
the
woman
in
question
who
make
the
application
make
it
on
28
June
2018
and
she
contact
the
forestry
service
on
7
April
this
year
after
bring
in
a
consultant
and
much
toing
and
froing
.
at
this
stage
,
a
conservative
estimate
be
that
there
be
up
to
100
piece
of
correspondence
between
she
,
as
the
applicant
,
and
the
Department
.
she
be
tell
on
7
April
that
they
could
not
tell
she
when
a
ecologist
would
be
appoint
to
deal
with
she
file
.
this
be
a
woman
,
a
farmer
,
with
a
modest
income
who
want
to
play
she
part
and
to
raise
she
family
.
she
want
to
contribute
to
climate
action
and
to
ensure
that
she
earn
a
modest
income
or
return
from
that
application
.
the
return
on
this
will
be
very
modest
.
she
be
not
a
big
farmer
.
she
be
not
rich
.
we
be
hit
four
year
with
this
application
,
and
I
cannot
tell
this
person
,
despite
all
the
engagement
I
have
have
with
the
Minister
of
State
's
Department
,
when
she
can
reasonably
expect
to
receive
she
felling
licence
.
this
crystallise
the
issue
.
we
may
get
into
the
weed
in
this
committee
concern
who
represent
the
commercial
forester
and
who
represent
other
.
the
fact
remain
,
however
,
that
there
be
a
perception
,
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
that
preference
and
priority
be
give
to
Coillte
application
and
that
the
screen
,
and
the
rule
for
screen
,
do
not
seem
to
apply
as
rigorously
to
Coillte
application
as
they
do
to
application
come
from
private
forestry
owner
.
I
just
want
to
be
able
to
go
back
to
my
constituent
-
who
be
a
decent
and
hard
-
work
person
who
have
raise
a
family
on
a
modest
hold
-
and
be
able
to
tell
she
that
she
will
have
she
licence
this
year
.
preferably
,
l
would
like
to
be
able
to
tell
she
she
will
have
she
licence
in
the
next
two
or
three
month
.
I
say
that
because
harvest
plan
have
be
produce
and
this
person
be
tell
before
that
the
ecology
report
be
be
work
on
.
as
public
representative
,
we
be
not
get
clear
sight
of
what
be
happen
internally
in
the
Department
.
therefore
,
the
Minister
of
State
can
surely
understand
why
frustration
arise
when
there
be
name
people
in
the
Department
who
have
responsibility
for
implement
the
policy
.
they
be
see
as
the
go
-
to
people
.
it
be
a
small
country
where
everybody
know
everybody
,
so
people
get
frustrated
and
people
get
name
.
the
Minister
of
State
will
understand
why
that
happen
.
person
perceive
that
blockage
be
be
put
in
place
.
in
this
case
it
be
almost
Kafkaesque
,
base
on
the
correspondence
I
have
see
between
this
applicant
and
the
Department
.
this
person
's
consultant
,
a
person
who
adhere
to
the
most
rigorous
professional
standard
,
make
the
application
and
do
the
harvest
plan
for
she
.
after
year
interact
with
the
forestry
service
,
and
this
consultant
be
a
forester
himself
,
he
be
now
scratch
he
head
and
say
he
cannot
understand
why
this
applicant
be
not
get
she
licence
.
this
sum
up
the
situation
.
can
the
Minister
of
State
understand
the
frustration
of
organisation
like
SEEFA
,
when
they
representative
be
tell
she
they
be
sell
sapling
to
Scotland
,
but
they
can
not
put
sapling
in
the
ground
here
?
I
be
try
to
take
the
heat
out
of
this
matter
,
but
I
be
deeply
frustrated
because
I
see
the
massive
potential
forestry
have
in
the
context
of
deal
with
climate
change
.
if
there
be
a
target
of
8,000
ha
,
why
be
that
not
be
reach
?
there
be
massive
potential
here
,
and
we
all
instinctively
know
what
it
be
.
I
understand
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
say
about
the
housing
sector
and
the
potential
for
forestry
to
deliver
in
that
regard
,
and
we
need
a
commercial
forestry
sector
for
that
aspect
.
there
be
also
private
forester
,
however
,
who
want
to
contribute
to
take
action
on
climate
change
,
who
want
to
grow
native
species
as
well
and
who
want
to
make
they
contribution
to
achieve
the
target
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
refer
,
but
they
cannot
see
how
they
be
go
to
do
that
now
.
I
will
go
back
to
this
woman
of
whom
I
have
speak
to
tell
she
I
have
raise
this
topic
today
.
hopefully
,
she
will
get
she
licence
as
soon
as
possible
because
of
the
Minister
of
State
's
intervention
.
when
I
ask
she
,
though
,
whether
she
will
plant
tree
after
this
experience
,
I
guarantee
that
she
answer
will
be
:
"
no
,
I
will
never
go
near
forestry
again
"
.
this
be
the
people
we
be
take
out
of
the
equation
because
of
the
system
that
exist
.
I
refer
to
the
honest
-
to
-
goodness
farmer
who
plant
a
bit
of
ground
.
as
SEEFA
have
say
,
that
bit
of
ground
be
that
farmer
's
wealth
.
if
confidence
among
this
people
be
dampen
,
then
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
regenerate
it
.
I
would
love
to
be
able
to
tell
my
constituent
about
the
system
that
have
be
put
in
place
,
the
regulatory
review
,
the
Mackinnon
report
,
the
stakeholder
all
come
together
and
there
be
many
more
policy
intervention
now
to
create
more
incentive
.
I
guarantee
,
though
,
that
she
will
never
go
near
planting
forestry
again
,
and
I
be
sure
we
be
speak
about
thousand
of
people
like
she
now
.
in
the
context
of
the
Minister
of
State
dig
out
this
file
,
I
serve
as
a
minister
of
State
for
five
year
and
I
use
to
get
into
the
nitty
-
gritty
of
detail
.
if
I
be
the
minister
of
State
with
special
responsibility
for
forestry
now
and
if
a
member
of
this
committee
raise
a
matter
concern
a
particular
file
,
then
I
would
say
that
I
want
that
file
on
my
desk
in
the
Department
in
the
afternoon
.
I
would
read
that
file
,
and
then
I
would
ask
question
regard
why
this
system
be
not
work
.
I
would
be
get
down
into
the
weed
of
every
file
I
could
,
and
I
would
be
ask
why
thing
be
not
happen
.
that
be
what
I
would
do
,
and
I
say
that
modestly
.
I
thank
the
chair
for
grant
I
latitude
.
will
the
minister
of
State
take
a
look
at
that
issue
?
I
thank
the
witness
for
they
contribution
.
this
be
a
very
important
issue
and
we
will
probably
have
more
hearing
on
it
.
we
have
a

of
other
witness
we
will
invite
in

guest
's
good
selve
in
the
SFPA
.
what
I
have
see
so
far
,
and
I
think
they
would
objectively
agree
,
be
that
a
tension
exist
,
and
I
use
the
word
"
tension
"
advisedly
.
I
need
to
have
a
good
understanding
of
the
governance
arrangement
and
the
statutory
function
of
the
SFPA
in
respect
of
its
relationship
with
,
in
the
first
instance
,
the
community
as
represent
by
fisher
and
processor
,
and
also
in
regard
to
this
consultative
committee
.
my
understanding
be
that
Mr.
Hayes
be
the
executive
chairperson
.
he
be
the
boss
,
as
it
be
,
to
use
a
colloquial
expression
.
be
that
the
case
?
Mr.
Hayes
be
,
de
facto
,
the
boss
.
it
be
a
serious
question
and
I
will
explain
why
that
be
.
in
the
brief
time
I
have
be
allocate
,
I
be
try
to
get
some
clear
understanding
of
the
dynamic
that
inform
the
organisation
.
be
Mr.
Hayes
the
boss
or
not
?
that
explain
it
.
bear
with
me-----
I
beg
the
Acting
Chairman
's
protection
.
I
be
go
to
be
very
respectful
and
ask
for
brevity
in
the
answer
.
that
be
all
I
ask
for
-
I
say
that
with
the
utmost
respect
-
because
I
want
to
cover
as
much
ground
as
possible
.
Mr.
Hayes
be
the
boss
and
the
de
facto
ceo
.
that
be
what
we
understand
,
in
business
parlance
,
a
executive
chairman
to
be
.
very
briefly
,
will
Mr.
Hayes
explain
what
a
notice
to
weigh
on
landing
be
?
I
will
defer
to
he
on
this
.
okay
.
that
be
fine
.
Mr.
Hayes
refer
to
a
meeting
that
take
place
on
4
February
.
be
the
issue
of
notice
to
weigh
on
landing
discuss
at
that
meeting
?
if
it
be
discuss
,
be
a
agreement
reach
in
regard
to
the
term
of
the
notice
to
weigh
on
landing
?
be
that
agree
at
that
meeting
on
4
February
?
this
be
a
yes
-
no
question
.
we
do
not
need
a
long
context
.
be
it
possible
,
within
reason
,
to
characterise
how
the
industry
would
have
perceive
the
outcome
of
that
meeting
on
4
February
?
could
the
industry
have
perceive
that
there
be
some
degree
of
agreement
in
regard
to
the
issue
of
the
notice
to
weigh
on
landing
?
what
be
the
process
by
which
the
notice
to
weigh
on
landing
be
withdraw
?
do
Mr.
Hayes
say
this
be
do
on
6
March
?
we
all
start
from
the
vantage
point
that
Ms
Loughnane
outline
early
-
we
all
value
the
industry
and
want
to
see
a
sustainable
industry
.
that
be
build
into
the
thinking
of
all
of
we
who
have
a
interest
in
the
sustainability
of
the
industry
,
include
processor
,
fisher
and
that
with
other
vantage
point
.
I
be
try
to
understand
the
dynamic
in
respect
of
the
consultative
committee
.
I
understand
Mr.
Hayes
attend
the
meeting
on
4
March
.
would
there
have
be
a
opportunity
at
that
meeting
to
further
discuss
the
issue
around
the
notice
to
weigh
on
landing
?
I
do
not
have
a
master
degree
in
fishery
policy
,
and
I
be
not
be
facetious
when
I
say
that
.
many
of
we
be
on
a
steep
learning
curve
.
if
there
be
a
consultative
committee
,
you
would
hope
the
culture
of
that
committee
would
be
such
that
you
would
all
move
together
in
lockstep
and
the
consultative
committee
would
be
the
mechanism
through
which
you
would
work
through
or
triage
all
of
this
issue
.
the
perception
I
have
be
that
the
industry
feel
it
be
on
the
back
foot
now
.
this
be
the
perception
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
it
feel
it
be
be
put
upon
.
as
a
layman
in
this
respect
,
I
fail
to
understand
why
the
industry
would
have
ownership
of
a
device
that
be
the
subject
of
a
regulatory
process
.
I
ask
Mr.
Hayes
to
forgive
I
if
it
be
a
stupid
question
,
but
I
be
not
afraid
to
ask
a
stupid
question
.
why
would
it
be
the
industry
?
if
you
be
regulate
the
industry
,
why
would
the
industry
own
the
device
or
the
machine
?
Mr.
Hayes
outline
option
for
we
.
I
be
still
try
to
understand
fully
the
difference
between
option
1
and
2
.
I
have
be
do
some
searching
and
make
some
note
.
be
there
be
a
danger
on
option
1
that
you
be
ask
a
operator
to
make
a
false
declaration
of
they
landing
?
water
will
potentially
be
record
as
fish
and
not
as
water
.
I
be
operate
from
the
note
I
be
jot
down
and
I
could
be
wrong
.
I
ask
Mr.
Hayes
to
forgive
I
if
I
be
way
off
the
mark
.
on
option
2
,
it
seem
to
I
-
again
,
I
could
be
wrong
so
he
can
disavow
I
of
my
ignorance
if
necessary
-
that
the
operator
can
drain
as
much
water
from
the
fish
he
or
she
choose
but
only
2
%
of
the
final
weight
can
get
record
as
water
.
be
I
understand
that
correctly
?
do
this
not
run
contrary
to
the
whole
issue
of
sustainability
and
preserve
the
fish
?
if
only
2
%
of
the
final
weight
can
be
record
as
water
,
what
permutation
do
that
have
for
the
quality
of
the
fish
in
situ
while
the
fish
be
go
through
this
process
?
we
be
in
Kafkaesque
territory
if
we
have
reach
a
point
on
this
lovely
island
of
ours
where
we
be
talk
about
such
option
.
I
really
want
to
understand
option
2
,
in
particular
.
I
be
worried
that
under
option
2
,
the
quality
of
the
fish
could
become
severely
diminish
.
the
sustainability
question
then
come
in
.
the
quality
question
also
come
in
,
as
do
the
value
question
that
we
be
all
concerned
about
.
Mr.
Hayes
do
not
have
to
tell
I
I
be
ignorant
if
it
be
a
ignorant
question
,
but
he
can
educate
I
.
I
be
happy
to
be
educate
.
do
that
tick
the
box
for
the
SFPA
in
term
of
dg
-
MARE
?
sorry
,
I
mean
to
refer
to
the
inadvertent
making
of
a
false
direction
.
be
that
a
possibility
?
I
be
not
say
-----
do
that
not
require
place
a
onus
on
the
vessel
to
have
ice
or
storage
facility
on
board
that
be
fit
for
purpose
so
as
not
to
compromise
the
quality
of
the
fish
?
be
that
not
place
a
additional
burden
on
the
vessel
thereafter
or
do
this
happen
so
quickly
that
there
be
no
such
compromise
of
the
quality
of
the
fish
?
be
this
not
all
very
surreal
?
do
Mr.
Hayes
not
sometimes
ask
how
we
get
to
the
stage
in
fishery
policy
where
we
be
talk
about
take
fish
off
a
vessel
,
put
it
into
another
tank
,
and
then
take
that
tank
and
put
it
back
into
the
vessel
again
?
on
a
human
level
,
be
that
not
a
bit
surreal
?
please
do
not
patronise
I
,
Sir
.
Mr.
Hayes
do
not
need
to
tell
I
about
my
role
here
.
Mr.
O'Mahony
might
explain
.
we
be
try
to
get
it
effectively
explain
for
the
punter
who
be
watch
this
proceedings
.
I
appreciate
that
.
yes

it
be

I
wish
to
continue
on
that
theme
.
if
I
set
aside
the
nature
trust
and
the
fact
that
corporate
be
pile
in
to
the
not
-
for
-
profit
sector
,
it
be
good
for
ESG
and
for
Coillte
.
that
be
where
the
game
be
at
globally
.
it
be
all
about
ESG
for
corporate
.
that
be
fine
.
I
can
understand
that
.
the
new
joint
venture
partnership
,
which
I
will
call
a
special
purpose
vehicle
,
Coillte
be
consider
set
up
or
be
about
to
set
up
be
a
good
way
along
the
road
.
the
process
be
not
nascent
or
under
consideration
.
it
be
very
active
.
if
I
be
read
Ms
Hurley
correctly
,
the
legislation
allow
Coillte
to
do
that
or
,
at
least
,
the
legislation
or
the
act
with
regard
to
notification
of
what
Coillte
propose
to
do
may
be
silent
.
I
do
not
know
.
I
have
not
go
through
the
Forestry
Act
with
a
fine
-
tooth
comb
,
yet
,
but
I
be
sure
the
witness
can
anticipate
we
will
.
the
answer
we
be
get
suggest
something
be
being
be
be
create
,
about
which
exactly
Coillte
be
not
at
liberty
to
tell
we
,
but
the
dog
here
on
the
street
know
exactly
what
be
be
create
,
with
whom
,
and
its
purpose
.
we
have
be
around
the
around
the
house
and
I
ask
for
clarity
.
do
such
a
vehicle
impact
on
Coillte
's
pre-exist
footprint
?
be
this
fund
or
special
purpose
vehicle
with
regard
to
the
additional
footprint
or
do
it
affect
the
entirety
of
the
Coillte
estate
?
that
be
fine
.
I
will
park
it
.
Mr.
Carlin
have
clarify
it
.
the
representative
have
make
mention
of
the
new
forestry
plant
and
€
1.3
billion
of
a
opportunity
.
it
be
clear
to
I
that
this
special
purpose
vehicle
will
now
bid
for
some
of
that
€
1.3
billion
opportunity
.
be
that
correct
?
this
be
simple
question
.
they
be
not
load
.
there
be
nothing
too
rhetorical
about
my
approach
.
I
be
look
for
light
more
than
heat
.
I
have
look
at
the
grant
rate
for
establishment
under
this
new
forestry
plan
.
I
assume
Coillte
will
have
look
at
all
of
this
and
kick
the
tyre
on
the
premium
for
the
farmer
or
landowner
and
will
have
look
at
the
establishment
grant
.
under
FT6
,
it
be
propose
that
the
current
grant
be
€
56220
per
ha
.
the
propose
grant
per
ha
for
broadleaf
,
mainly
oak
,
be
€
6744
.
I
be
only
take
ft6
.
we
know
there
be
FT1
to
FT12
.
let
we
keep
that
figure
in
mind
.
for
broadleaf
,
mainly
oak
,
the
premium
be
€
6744
.
Mr.
Carlin
will
be
familiar
with
the
Auxilia
Group
and
its
report
.
I
think
we
all
accept
Professor
Cathal
O'Donoghue
's
bona
fide
.
the
professor
be
renown
and
well
establish
.
I
be
sure
Mr.
Carlin
have
have
access
to
this
Auxilia
Group
report
.
I
accept
Professor
O'Donoghue
's
bone
fide
anyway
.
I
hope
Coillte
do
as
well
.
in
Professor
O'Donoghue
's
report
,
on
page
37
,
there
be
a
table
entitle
"
estimate
total
establishment
cost
by
species
in
2023
"
.
Professor
O'Donoghue
state
,
for
broadleaf
hard
,
the
total
cost
will
be
€
10551
.
remember
we
have
€
6744
of
a
grant
,
exclude
the
fencing
,
and
this
report
be
say
-----
grant
rate
.
chair
,
I
think
I
say
I
be
exclude
premium
.
let
I
very
clear
.
I
be
talk
about
establishment
grant
.
chair
,
may
I
have
some
protection
here
?
establishment
grant
only
.
that
be
all
we
be
talk
about
here
.
okay
?
so
as
not
to
interrupt
my
flow
again
,
chair
,
with
all
due
respect
.
I
thank
the
chairman
.
the
cost
for
broadleaf
soft
be
€
9631
.
if
I
accept
the
bona
fide
of
Professor
O'Donoghue
and
if
I
accept
the
figure
that
the
minister
have
put
to
we
in
term
of
the
new
forestry
grant
already
,
I
see
the
people
who
will
establish
this
new
forestry
grounds
to
meet
all
of
we
target
and
all
of
we
ambition
as
set
out
,
even
include
in
Coillte
's
"
a
greener
Future
for
all
"
.
that
be
a
great
document
.
it
capture
the
Zeitgeist
.
it
need
to
be
where
we
need
to
be
.
Coillte
be
show
real
leadership
for
the
first
time
in
a
generation
in
respect
of
acknowledge
the
role
that
Coillte
can
play
in
term
of
mitigation
through
afforestation
and
sequestration
,
and
also
in
term
of
the
public
good
.
that
be
all
good
.
however
,
I
cannot
see
,
when
one
kick
the
tyre
on
that
figure
,
how
one
will
get
in
the
person
-
power
-
let
I
not
be
gendered
in
my
language
-
to
be
able
to
create
the
opportunity
that
Coillte
be
talk
about
or
,
and
this
be
where
I
really
need
Mr.
Carlin
's
perspective
,
the
economy
of
scale
that
Coillte
have
to
be
able
to
compete
in
the
market
,
or
squeeze
the
market
,
so
much
that
it
will
be
able
to
say
to
private
forester
or
contractor
that
it
will
take
they
in
.
what
will
happen
be
that
private
forestry
will
be
squeeze
out
because
Coillte
will
have
the
economy
of
scale
to
be
able
to
pay
the
premium
and
possibly
additionality
there
as
well
through
the
creation
of
this
joint
venture
.
I
worry
that
when
everything
be
wind
up
,
it
will
be
Coillte
with
the
joint
venture
.
the
fund
manager
,
as
Mr.
Carlin
say
,
will
already
be
the
owner
.
therefore
,
the
fund
manager
,
management
company
or
whatever
the
entity
be
on
the
additionality
will
walk
away
with
the
premium
.
Irish
private
forestry
contractor
will
be
force
to
work
for
this
entity
because
it
will
be
the
entity
that
will
have
the
economy
of
scale
to
be
able
to
outdo
the
small
private
forestry
owner
.
do
that
make
sense
?
do
that
concern
chime
with
Mr.
Carlin
in
any
way
?
I
will
put
it
a
different
way
.
if
I
go
back
to
that
€
6744
,
if
one
have
land
that
be
at
scale
with
a
partner
that
be
fund
into
this
new
so
-
call
"
Coillte
nua
"
entity
,
Mr.
Carlin
be
tell
I
that
the
small
forestry
company
,
forester
and
contractor
be
more
agile
and
lean
.
I
remain
to
be
convinced
of
what
Mr.
Carlin
be
say
there
,
and
I
say
that
respectfully
.
if
Coillte
be
compete
in
that
space
for
that
€
6744
and
it
have
get
the
personnel
and
the
access
to
equipment
and
machinery
that
it
will
begin
to
build
up
,
I
can
not
see
how
Coillte
could
not
but
squeeze
out
the
small
operator
unless
they
get
subsume
by
Coillte
and
begin
to
become
price
-
taker
on
contract
that
so
-
call
"
Coillte
nua
"
begin
to
control
.
in
other
word
,
Coillte
nua
would
control
the
entire
forestry
sector
and
there
would
be
a
squeezing
out
of
the
small
private
forestry
company
.
it
be
a
genuine
fear
that
I
have
.
there
be
a
difference
.
a
private
forest
company
will
naturally
go
for
private
investment
.
it
have
no
other
choice
.
that
be
a
give
.
Coillte
be
State
-
own
.
that
be
the
difference
.
I
hope
Mr.
Carlin
can
appreciate
here
that
what
be
a
resource
and
what
people
feel
they
have
ownership
of
be
a
entity
that
they
want
,
not
for
they
generation
but
for
future
generation
who
belong
to
we
all
.
can
Mr.
Carlin
understand
the
fear
of
people
when
he
talk
about
new
construct
,
joint
venture
,
special
purpose
vehicle
or
whatever
?
the
legislation
allow
Coillte
to
do
what
it
want
in
term
of
notify
or
not
notify
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
I
be
sure
there
be
a
relationship
with
Coillte
such
that
it
be
keep
the
Department
,
its
key
shareholder
,
abreast
of
everything
that
be
go
on
.
however
,
my
fear
be
that
we
will
end
up
with
large
swathe
of
we
own
land
own
by
corporate
entity
,
which
be
offshore
,
which
be
international
and
which
be
compete
with
Irish
people
.
this
be
unnamed
corporate
and
international
investment
fund
.
all
of
that
be
be
cloak
in
the
language
of
ESG
,
of
environmental
goods
and
of
climate
action
.
that
be
the
fear
we
have
.
we
have
sell
off
a
lot
of
resource
in
this
country
that
we
could
do
with
now
.
I
will
take
as
a
example
Irish
Sugar
in
my
hometown
of
Mallow
,
which
be
sell
down
the
river
for
a
song
.
the
fear
I
have
be
that
this
be
what
Coillte
be
at
as
well
.
I
would
like
to
have
Ms
Hurley
's
perspective
.
I
ask
for
a
few
more
second
.
Ms
Hurley
mention
Irish
investor
.
be
this
a
multiplicity
of
special
purpose
vehicle
?
there
be
the
one
entity
that
have
already
be
name
,
which
be
a
UK
investor
.
be
Ms
Hurley
say
there
be
other
investor
that
will
join
with
it
or
Irish
investor
who
be
go
to
take
a
piece
of
the
pie
as
well
?
I
thank
the
delegation
for
give
the
committee
a
lot
of
food
for
thought
.
the
next
committee
meeting
be
tomorrow
evening

the
eradication
