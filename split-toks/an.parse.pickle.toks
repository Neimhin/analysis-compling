,
which
will
be

this

will
contain
provision
that
be
consider
to
be
too
urgent
to
wait
for
the
completion
of
the
"
Big

"
.
this
Bill
amend
the

it
be
not

obviously
the

.
as
the
goal
of

be
to
consolidate
all
exist

,
it
be
intend
that
the
"

be
subsume
into
it
,
ideally
by
way
of
report
stage
amendment
.
I
would
also
like
to
note
that
I
be
consider
introduce

stage
to
harmonise
advertising
requirement

only
be

consistently
throughout
the

I
move

I
be

under
section

(
c
)
,
every
company
be
oblige
to
allow
any
person
to
inspect
its

on
the
payment
of
a

which
must
be

section
216
(
12
)
(
c
)
oblige
company
to
send
a
copy
of
they
member
's
register
to
any
person
who
request
it
,
again
for
a
fee
of
€
10
or
less
.
this
register
contain
the
name
and
address
of
member
and
the
number
of
share
hold
by
each
member
.
this
also
apply
to
unlimited
company
.
as
there
be
currently
no
requirement
to
report
this
information
to
the
company
Registration
Office
,
it
would
be
costly
to
set
up
a
register
both
for
the
company
Registration
Office
and
for
the
affect
company
.
the
ongoing
cost
to
the
cro
and
affect
company
of
make
and
process
thousand
of
notification
would
also
be
significant
.
the
cost
involve
in
delay
to
transfer
of
ownership
of

would
be
unacceptably
high
and
could
interfere
with
constitutional
rights

the
information
be
already
publicly
available
on

and
the
cost
of
create
and
maintain
such
a
public

would
be
considerable
,
so
I
be
not
in
favour
of
this
amendment

there
be
no
problem
return
to
this
on
report
stage
for
further
deliberation
,
but
we
must
acknowledge
that
unlimited
company
function
within
the
Irish
infrastructure
,
serve
many
legitimate

purpose
.
they
be
a
feature
of

law

European

issue
have
be
raise
with
regard
to
transparency
,
and
perhaps
we
can
provide
more
clarity
in
that
respect
for
the
next
stage
.
just
as
guarantee
and
public
limited
company
be
important
for
certain
kind
of
business
,
unlimited
company
also
serve
a
important
purpose
.
I
be
not
suggest
that
anybody
be
necessarily
seek
to
remove
they
,
but
to
do
so
would
be
a
disproportionate
act
which
could
affect
Ireland
's
competitive
advantage
.
I
do
not
know
if
it
be
possible
to
quantify
the
burden
of
cost
but
we
can
try
to
do
some
work
on
it
between
now
and
the
next
stage
of
the
Bill
.
the
issue
mention
by
deputy
Wallace
be
due
to
be
address
in

month
and
I
be
sure
the
deputy
be
aware
that
a
accounting
directive

EU
,
be
to
be
introduce

it
could
be
a
more
suitable
way
of
address
that
issue
.
that
be
a
potential
resource
for
the
committee
.
the
matter
could
be
address
on
report
stage
in
order
to
provide
great
clarity
.
the
primary
aim
of
this
Bill
be
the
consolidation
of
exist
law
and
the
provision
of
a
user
-
friendly
framework
for
business
operate
in
Ireland
.
we
must
take
into
account
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
Bill
.
the
issue
that
have
be
raise
by
a
number
of
member
could
be
address

that

I
will
explain
the
reason
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
the
amendment
.
I
understand
deputy
Calleary
,
in
he
contribution
on
second
stage
,
indicate
that
the
minister
should
consider
a
simplify
version
of
the
independent
accountant
's
report
and
the
application
paper
for
the
appointment
of
a
examiner
to
streamline
the
application
process
.
the
current
court
process
mirror
the
requirement
of
the
company
(
amendment
)
Act
1990
in
respect
of
the
appointment
of
a
examiner
.
section
3
of
that
act
require
that
a
petition
for
the
appointment
of
a
examiner
be
accompany
by
a
report
prepare
by
a
independent
accountant
.
section
3
(
3
)
(
b
)
set
out
the
area
the
report
be
require
to
cover
.
the
Bill
do
not
propose
to
change
this
arrangement
because
the
report
of
the
independent
accountant
be
essential
to
assist
the
court
in
determine
whether
the
company
have
a
reasonable
prospect
of
survival
.
if
the
court
be
not
satisfied
that
the
company
as
a
whole
or
any
part
of
the
undertaking
have
a
reasonable
prospect
of
survival
as
a
go
concern
,
it
be
preclude
from
make
a
order
appoint
a
examiner
.
thus
,
the
independent
accountant
's
report
be
a
crucial
piece
of
evidence
for
the
court
to
consider
.
it
should
explain
,
in
a
reasoned
manner
,
why
the
independent
accountant
be
of
the
view
that
the
company
,
and
the
whole
or
part
of
its
undertaking
,
have
a
reasonable
prospect
of
survival
.
the
report
must
have
regard
to
a
number
of
important
matter
,
as
detailed
in
section
3
(
3
)
(
b
)
of
the
company
(
amendment
)
Act
1990
.
the
appointment
of
a
examiner
to
a
company
will
interfere
with
the
rights
of
creditor
and
it
be
,
therefore
,
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
independent
accountant
's
report
provide
evidence
that
will
satisfy
the
court
that
the
company
have
a
reasonable
prospect
of
survival
as
a
go
concern
and
whether
a
compromise
or
scheme
of
arrangement
with
creditor
would
offer
such
a
prospect
of
survival
.
modify
the
term
which
underpin
the
report
would
create
a
significant
risk
that
the
rights
of
creditor
and
they
business
,
which
may
also
have
employee
,
would
be
impact
further
as
the
evidential
threshold
would
be
low
.
the
Office
of
Parliamentary
counsel
have
also
advise
that
allow
the
minister
to
alter
the
arrangement
in
question
by
way
of
a
statutory
instrument
would
not
legally
be
permissible
as
it
would
exceed
the
extent
to
which
matter
can
be
delegate
to
a
minister
,
have
regard
to
the
constitution
.
in
respect
of
deputy
Calleary
's
amendment
which
have
be
rule
out
of
order
,
it
be
a
matter
of
common
sense
and
prudence
for
individual
or
company
with
a
intention
to
procure
goods
or
service
to
establish
first
the
cost
or
the
estimate
cost
of
this
.
it
would
be
particularly
pertinent
in
the
circumstance
in
question
here
.
the
reform
be
carry
out
be
be
bring
through
the
legal
Service
Regulation
Bill
which
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Shatter
,
be
sponsor
and
which
be
currently
before
the
House
.
this
will
provide
for
further
disclosure
of
actual
and
potential
cost
to
client
of
any
proceedings
for
which
the
legal
practitioner
be
be
engage
.
that
Bill
be
introduce
a
series
of
enhance
transparency
measure
on
legal
cost
and
be
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
debate
on
the
legal
cost
aspect
of
this
.
in
broad
term
,
it
would
not
seem
appropriate
that
the
responsible
regulator
for
the
profession
involve
would
advertise
the
fee
of
individual
practitioner
.
this
would
be
open
to
all
type
of
misinterpretation
,
include
,
perhaps
,
a
quasi-
endorsement
of
the
fee
concerned
.
alternatively
,
it
could
lead
to
the
fee
so
publicise
become
set
minima
which
,
in
effect
,
could
impede
competition
among
the
relevant
service
provider
who
would
have
a
officially
publish
price
list
to
hide
behind
.
there
be
a
inherent
danger
there
.
if
the
real
purpose
be
to
police
level
of
fee
charge
by
the
profession
in
question
,
I
would
contend
that
it
be
not
appropriate
to
include
such
a
provision
in
a
specific
and
target
measure
as
that
under
consideration
here
.
I
take
the
point
.
I
suppose
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
we
propose
to
implement
legislation
in
respect
of
the
matter
.
that
be
progress
,
if
one
take
the
grand
historical
narrative
of
the
foundation
of
the
State
and
the
particular
profession
involve
.
I
propose
to
bring
forward
a
amendment
to
section
8
at
report
stage
.
in
response
to
a
amendment
propose
by
Senator
Barrett
on
report
stage
in
the
Seanad
,
I
agree
to
make
a
amendment
to
provide
for
what
he
be
propose
.
this
relate
to
a
provision
that
the
regulation
which
the
minister
be
propose
to
be
empower
to
make
under
section
8
(
2
)
will
be
lay
before
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
in
deal
with
this
propose
amendment
on
report
stage
in
the
Seanad
,
I
propose
that
,
in
incorporate
the
present
measure
into
the
company
Bill
2012
,
the
requisite
amendment
would
be
include
as
a
amendment
in
that
Bill
.
it
have
since
transpire
that
the
Office
of
Parliamentary
counsel
can
facilitate
the
draft
of
this
amendment
in
time
for
the
report
stage
in
this
House
and
I
be
pleased
to
be
able
to
confirm
that
I
will
be
bring
forward
this
amendment
at
report
stage
of
this
Bill

what
we
have
here
be
a
set
of
national
contact
point
which
will
liaise
with
the
institute
of
technology
and
with
individual
entity
within
the
university
.
this
be
the
go
-
to
contact
for
industry
and
academic
.
we
be
target
a
increase
in
regard
to
the
number
of
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
that
be
engage
with
programme
like
Horizon
2020
.
we
have
raise
the
bar
up
to
20
%
engagement
in
term
of
a
drawdown
of
funding
.
the
funding
target
be
some
€
1.25
billion
,
which
should
present
significant
opportunity
for
the
SME
sector
.
we
have
put
in
place
a
technology
transfer
strengthening
initiative
,
ttsi
programme
,
which
be
fund
through
Enterprise
Ireland
,
and
there
be
technology
transfer
office
within
the
individual
organisation
.
the
national
intellectual
property
protocol
deal
with
how
industry
engage
with
academia
in
term
of
collaboration
and
how
it
mine
that
intellectual
property
.
there
should
not
,
therefore
,
be
any
ambiguity
for
anybody
who
want
to
talk
to
a
institute
of
technology
or
university
in
regard
to
mining
that
type
of
opportunity
.
there
be
clear
protocol
in
that
regard
.
the
major
challenge
,
which
deputy
Lawlor
touch
on
,
relate
to
how
we
encourage
that
in
the
SME
sector
,
particularly
that
who
own
small
and
,
quite
possibly
,
intergenerational
business
,
to
engage
with
the
institute
of
technology
in
the
context
of
innovation
partnership
or
innovation
voucher
.
there
may
be
a
job
of
work
to
be
do
in
the
context
of
improve
the
profile
of
innovation
voucher
among
small
business
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
they
value
.
the
leo
may
be
the
means
by
which
that
could
be
do
.
I
do
not
wish
to
be
parochial
but
I
be
aware
of
the
intimate
working
of
the
system
in
Cork
and
I
know
there
be
quite
a
advanced
,
if
informal
,
network
in
place
which
allow
business
to
interact
with
Cork
Institute
of
Technology
,
CIT
.
however
,
I
be
not
sure
whether
this
be
replicate
throughout
the
country
and
there
may
be
a
need
for
work
to
also
be
do
in
this
regard
.
the
net
point
be
that
large
corporation
will
have
relationship
through
the
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
SFI
,
research
centre
and
the
technology
gateway
centre
.
the
relationship
in
this
regard
be
quite
formalise
and
deep
.
we
want
to
encourage
the
participation
of
more
business
which
would
not
have
interact
on
this
level
.
such
business
could
,
for
example
,
be
operate
in
the
light
engineering
sector
and
could
be
intergenerational
in
nature
.
that
involved
with
firm
of
this
nature
may
be
extremely
intelligent
people
who
may
not
have
go
through
the
formal
system
of
third
level
education
,
but
they
be
still
run
great
business
and
they
possess
major
skill
set
.
this
individual
may
not
be
think
about
grow
they
operation
in
a
particular
way
or
about
move
in
a
direction
which
will
facilitate
new
innovation
.
there
be
a
opportunity
for
Ireland
to
improve
its
position
in
the
context
of
this
sector
.
we
must
ensure
there
be
a
great
knowledge
among
people
with
regard
to
the
potential
of
innovation
voucher
.
there
be
that
who
may
argue
about
whether
the
level
of
take
-
up
in
respect
of
the
innovation
partnership
have
be
sufficiently
high
.
the
position
with
regard
to
take
-
up
may
relate
to
people
aim
for
the
top
end
,
maximum
amount
of
€
250000
rather
than
for
the
minimum
amount
of
€
50000
.
the
latter
amount
could
,
of
course
,
have
as
much
of
a
impact
as
the
former
in
the
context
of
the
industry
or
SME
academic
partnership
which
be
drive
by
Enterprise
Ireland
.
it
cost
nothing
for
the
owner
of
a
business
to
contact
he
or
she
local
institute
of
technology
or
technology
gateway
centre
.
I
have
with
I
the
Technology
Centre
Expo
2013
booklet
,
which
act
as
a
very
good
guide
to
the
technology
centre
that
exist
within
the
institute
of
technology
,
for
example
.
that
centre
be
natural
gateway
for
industry
involve
in
a
range
of
sector
,
from
the
production
of
food
right
through
to
medical
device
,
to
come
on
board
.
the
key
point
be
that
the
system
relate
to
more
well
-
establish
or
technology
-
drive
company
be
quite
advanced
.
what
we
be
concerned
with
here
be
try
to
get
that
who
operate
small
or
medium
-
sized
business
to
start
consider
how
they
might
obtain
access
to
the
information
that
be
available
.
as
state
,
it
cost
nothing
to
get
involved
in
a
conversation
.
it
could
be
argue
that
the
wall
be
impenetrable
.
however
,
I
be
of
the
view
that
that
wall
be
be
break
down
quite
quickly
.
the
deputy
would
be
surprise
by
the
number
of
people
who
attend
the
launch
of
Horizon
2020
.
I
meet
a
man
from
my
region
who
be
a
painter
and
decorator
by
trade
and
who
be
present
at
that
launch
to
examine
a
business
opportunity
.
there
be
a
new
confidence
among
people
but
we
need
to
do
more
to
drive
business
forward
.
person
's
experience
with
regard
to
innovation
voucher
will
be
different
.
if
a
voucher
be
not
work
in
a
way
that
suit
a
particular
company
that
be
try
to
drive
innovation
and
if
it
be
agree
,
in
principle
,
that
there
be
scope
for
new
innovation
,
then
one
would
argue
that
Enterprise
Ireland
's
suite
of
support
should
be
buy
to
bear
in
respect
of
that
company
in
any
event
.
I
accept
the
point
and
it
be
important
that
Enterprise
Ireland
should
analyse
the
output
relate
to
innovation
voucher
.
that
be
certainly
something
which
can
be
do
.
yes
,
but
one
could
argue
that
we
do
not
necessarily
want
the
institute
of
technology
or
the
university
to
see
this
as
a
revenue
stream
.
be
the
deputy
refer
to
Horizon
2020
?
the
government
,
through
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
have
effectively
do
a
deal
with
industry
whereby
it
will
provide
€
100
million
in
funding
and
the
taxpayer
will
provide
€
200
million
to
facilitate
the
roll
-
out
of
research
centre
.
the
work
at
one
of
that
centre
specifically
relate
to
marine
renewable
energy
.
this
will
be
a
world
-
class
research
facility
.
we
be
also
involved
in
the
European
Commission
's
Atlantic
strategy
,
which
be
launch
by
Commissioner
Geoghegan
-
Quinn
and
the
Taoiseach
.
this
strategy
relate
to
evaluate
the
Atlantic
's
potential
in
the
context
of
renewable
energy
and
would
involve
country
collaborate
with
each
other
.
I
take
the
point
that
have
be
make
.
there
be
knowledge
and
innovation
community
and
various
theme
that
have
be
negotiate
through
Horizon
2020
,
in
particular
one
in
which
we
have
a
specific
interest
that
relate
to
food
and
that
will
be
roll
out
soon
.
country
will
have
to
collaborate
with
each
other
along
that
theme
anyway
.
in
respect
of
Horizon
2020
,
that
research
centre
will
be
roll
out
with
the
idea
of
leverage
great
funding
from
the
EU
because
of
they
size
.
by
create
that
economy
of
scale
and
force
more
academic
institution
to
collaborate
with
each
other
along
thematic
line
,
large
entity
be
be
create
that
will
be
able
to
leverage
opportunity
from
Horizon
2020
from
a
€
80
billion
fund
along
that
theme
to
which
the
deputy
refer
.
in
view
of
the
two
jurisdiction
,
we
be
work
very
closely
with
Northern
Ireland
and
InterTrade
Ireland
to
enable
that
concerned
pitch
for
that
kind
of
funding
as
well
.
there
be
opportunity
there
.
I
would
like
to
know
to
whom
the
deputy
speak
.
the
system
in
Ireland
be
base
on
academic
institution
.
there
be
other
model
like
the
Fraunhofer
model
in
Germany
which
act
as
stand
-
alone
entity
.
we
have
the
Tyndall
National
Institute
but
it
be
align
to
a
academic
institution
.
I
be
not
sure
how
to
answer
the
deputy
's
question
other
than
to
say
that
if
a
company
be
innovative
and
arguably
have
a
relationship
with
a
State
agency
,
the
chance
be
that
if
it
be
go
to
look
for
funding
,
it
will
already
have
a
relationship
with
one
of
the
State
agency
and
will
find
its
way
to
one
of
the
Enterprise
Ireland
or
national
contact
point
to
seek
that
opportunity
to
draw
down
funding
as
per
the
SME
target
about
which
I
speak
early
.
the
company
will
already
be
alive
to
that
opportunity
so
we
do
not
think
there
be
any
need
to
change
the
model
in
that
sense
.
we
be
a
small
country
.
what
be
the
deputy
suggest
?
I
do
not
understand
what
she
be
suggest
.
if
one
look
at
food
Health
Ireland
,
one
will
see
there
be
a
alignment
to
a
number
of
academic
institution
.
the
reason
why
it
work
here
be
because
we
have
cross-collaboration
between
different
academic
institution
.
there
can
be
more
than
one
academic
institution
map
on
to
a
theme
,
which
be
normally
the
case
.
if
one
look
at
Teagasc
in
Moorpark
or
Alimentary
Pharmabiotic
Centre
in
University
College
Cork
,
one
can
see
that
a
number
of
state
entity
and
a
number
of
different
and
compete
industrial
partner
be
involved
in
that
.
there
be
a
mechanism
to
allow
they
to
share
knowledge
,
which
be
arguably
a
good
model
because
it
result
in
great
economic
activity
for
Ireland
at
the
end
of
the
day
.
most
company
will
already
have
research
arm
with
they
parent
company
.
the
model
we
have
in
Ireland
be
one
of
government
collaborate
with
industry
and
it
work
.

the

provide
a
exemption
from
the

under
the
term
of
the
working
dependant
agreement
with
the
US
and
Canada
,
both
of
which
predate
the
employment
permit
legislation
,
relevant
dependant

official
assign
abroad
be
entitle

a
authorisation
to
work

the
other
country

this
system
have

base
here
must
be
accompany
by
a

offer
,
in
contradiction
of

this
international
agreement
.
while
we
partner
in
the
US
and
Canada
implement
the
term
of
work
dependant
agreement
in
full
,
we
legislation
as
it
stand
mean
Ireland
cannot
fulfil
its
obligation
to
we
partner
.
the
US
have
note
on
several
occasion
that
Ireland
's
insistence
on
receipt
of
a
formal

offer
before
issue
the
employment
permit
be
in
breach
of
the
agreement
be
implement
in
full
by
the
US
.
it
be
not
expect
that
the
amendment
will
lead
to
a
substantial
increase
in
non-Irish
national
seek
work
under
the
term
of
work
dependant
agreement

in
addition
,
the
exemption
end

use
in
the
legislation
,
which
fall
out
of
the
treatment
of
the
intra-company
transfer
situation
in

.
I
be
consider
further
minor
amendment
to
section

will
revert
on

stage
.
in
essence
,
in
language
which
be
legislative
with

the
nub
of
the

be
that

notwithstanding
the

it

we
have
engage

through

the

it

the

relief

I
be
not

the
shoulder
note
for
section
4
of
the
Bill
as
publish
must
be
amend
to
read
:
"
Insertion
into
Act
of
2003
of
new
section
2b
and
2c
"
.
I
be
sure
the
deputy
will
accept
that
as
the
Younis
case
be
sub
judice
I
be
limited
in
term
of
what
I
can
say
in
that
regard
.
in
regard
to
the
deputy
's
point
generally
in
term
of
the
robustness
of
the
provision
when
a
complaint
be
make
,
it
be
the
responsibility
of
NERA
to
investigate
complaint
and
to
ensure
that
the
system
stand
up
to
scrutiny
.
in
regard
to
the
compensatory
element
of
the
deputy
's
question
,
the
particular
case
mention
-
I
be
couch
my
language
-----
the
minister
can
also
take
a
case
if
there
have
be
a
breach
of
the
law
.
this
be
where
NERA
come
into
the
equation
.
when
a
complaint
be
make
,
there
be
a
robust
investigation
of
potential
exploitation
with
clear
outcome
.
on
the
compensation
issue
,
the
compensation
provide
for
be
the
national
minimum
wage
or
other
mandatory
statutory
rate
of
pay
for
the
job
.
we
determine
this
when
deal
with
deputy
Tóibín
's
amendment
.
this
be
provide
for
in
law
so
that
there
be
no
ambiguity
.
the
complex
standard
of
proof
arise
where
a
court
be
determine
how
much
compensation
should
be
pay
.
it
be
necessary
to
remove
that
ambiguity
.
in
term
of
the
specific
case
mention
,
the
question
that
arise
be
whether
there
be
a
legal
contract
of
employment
.
what
we
be
do
be
move
to
a
situation
whereby
a
person
who
make
a
complaint
and
have
act
reasonably
in
term
of
he
or
she
employment
condition
and
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
have
a
contract
will
also
be
cover
by
this
legislation
.
we
be
put
a
belt
and
brace
approach
around
the
exist
legislation
such
that
there
be
a
comfort
for
anybody
who
find
themselves
in
a
exploitative
situation
that
they
can
come
forward
and
make
a
complaint
and
that
there
be
a
corpus
of
law
that
do
not
put
a
prohibitive
cost
on
they
in
so
do
because
there
be
a
statutory
body
,
namely
,
NERA
,
that
exist
to
err
on
they
side
where
exploitation
occur
.
it
be
a
illegal
scenario
.
the
distinction
that
must
be
make
be
that
this
apply
where
no
legal
contract
exist
.
I
will
try
to
clarify
the
matter
.
it
be
not
the
intention
of
the
civil
proceedings
to
provide
compensation
base
on
the
market
or
statutory
rate
for
the
job
but
rather
to
provide
compensation
in
a
situation
where
there
be
no
legal
contract
.
the
national
minimum
wage
be
clear
and
unambiguous
.
if
there
be
other
statutory
provision
that
apply
to
certain
rate
for
certain
type
of
job
,
then
there
be
no
ambiguity
.
if
there
be
a
contract
of
employment
-----
that
be
on
the
basis
that
there
be
a
legal
contract
in
place
.
if
a
employer
provide
a
employee
with
a
contract
of
employment
,
there
be
a
rate
for
the
job
inherent
in
that
contract
.
we
be
provide
for
a
situation
in
which
no
legal
contract
be
provide
and
to
allow
in
respect
of
a
employee
who
have
no
legal
contract
and
be
exploit
for
he
or
she
to
be
compensate
on
the
basis
of
the
national
minimum
wage
or
as
provide
by
statute
.
while
I
accept
the
spirit
of
the
amendment
,
I
respectfully
suggest
that
it
be
incongruous
.
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
be
to
provide
for
case
where
there
be
no
legal
contract
.
be
the
deputy
by
virtue
of
he
amendment
place
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
person
who
be
be
exploit
to
prove
that
another
employee
have
a
different
contract
?
what
submission
will
in
this
regard
be
make
to
the
court
?
how
would
that
be
do
before
a
court
of
law
?
I
genuinely
take
the
amendment
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
be
propose
,
but
one
must
consider
the
legislation
in
its
entirety
.
for
the
first
time
we
be
provide
clarity
for
the
court
where
exploitation
take
place
and
a
judgment
be
make
in
a
case
in
which
there
be
no
contract
.
we
be
bolt
to
it
,
for
want
of
a
good
term
,
a
de
minimis
compensatory
regime
which
will
at
least
allow
a
person
where
there
be
a
finding
in
he
or
she
favour
to
receive
compensation
base
on
statutory
provision
.
in
previous
court
case
there
be
a
lack
of
clarity
.
I
respectfully
contend
the
amendment
as
propose
by
deputy
Peadar
Tóibín
could
provide
for
a
case
in
which
proceedings
could
be
delay
or
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
person
be
exploit
or
who
could
be
potentially
exploit
could
become
completely
unwieldy
,
as
clarity
could
not
be
provide
for
.
the
section
before
we
provide
clarity
and
there
be
absolutely
no
ambiguity
about
the
rate
of
compensation
be
provide
for
where
there
be
no
legal
contract
.
it
be
on
that
basis
that
we
be
not
accept
amendment
no.

.
I
move
amendment
no.

this
be
a
deliberate
policy

during

of

the
issue
of

the
legal
advice

be
that

cross
over
into
the
legislative
domain
of
the
Minister
for

second
,
the
question
for
the
minister
for
the
purpose
of
the
dependant

partner

permit
be
whether
there
be
a
subsist
relationship
of

,
that
be
,
it
be
for
the
applicant
of
such
permit
to
satisfy
the
minister
that
he
or
she
be
a
spouse
,
partner
or
dependant
at
the
time
of
application
or
renewal
.
the
status
of
relationship
between
the
primary
permit
holder
and
he
or
she
family
member
be
a
matter
for
the
Irish
Immigration
and
Naturalisation
Service
under
the
auspices
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and

.
the
situation

the
presence
in
the
state
of
former
partner
or
spouse
of
primary
permit
holder

in
the
first
instance
a
matter
for
that
minister
.
establish
the
situation
of
a
spouse

civil
partner
whose
relationship
with
the
primary
permit
holder
have
come
to
a
end
be
beyond
the
remit
of
the
employment
permit
system
.
however
,
the
reactivation

permit
scheme
should
facilitate

who
have

permission
from

on
this
basis
,
the
majority
of

of

will
be
capable
of

for
in

new

and
as
such
,
I

the

the
target
be
85
per
annum
reach
approximately
100
per
annum
up
to
2016
and
beyond
.
one
cannot
give
a
definitive
figure
because
many
variable
enter
into
the
fray
,
include
intellectual
property
and
commercialisation
of
research
,
but
the
most
important
point
be
that
we
be
in
a
space
where
we
be
seek
to
spin
out
as
many
company
as
possible
on
a
indigenous
basis
.
I
believe
the
number
for
last
year
be
31
.
one
would
hope
to
see
that
increase
but
on
the
high
potential
start
-
up
,
the
target
be
85
reach
a
final
target
of
approximately
100
per
year
from
2016
.
I
have
a
meeting
with
Mr.
Cunningham
yesterday
.
the
budget
line
be
important
because
the
event
,
which
will
take
place
in
mid-July
next
year
,
will
attract
researcher
and
person
within
the
scientific
community
at
the
high
level
to
we
shore
.
this
be
a
pan-European
win
,
so
to
speak
.
the
fact
that
we
be
able
to
win
that
competition
against
stiff
competition
from
place
like
Vienna
be
a
good
testament
to
where
we
stand
within
that
global
scientific
community
.
that
win
and
this
investment
be
vital
in
term
of
we
reputation
because
in
enable
we
to
attract
top
level
researcher
we
be
send
out
further
signal
into
the
research
and
science
field
.
that
will
result
in
add
win
for
we
in
the
future
.
we
will
gain
from
it
by
virtue
of
its
profiling
in
the
first
instance
.
the
programme
be
comprehensive
and
intensive
.
it
will
roll
out
across
the
State
over
the
12
month
but
will
be
focus
primarily
within
that
four
or
five
day
.
the
fact
that
there
will
be
industry
involvement
and
all
of
the
stakeholder
involve
over
that
four
or
five
day
will
ensure
we
will
be
able
to
lay
a
further
foundation
or
ramp
it
up
,
so
to
speak
,
to
ensure
we
can
make
further
gain
in
this
field
ultimately
in
term
of
foreign
direct
investment
.
one
way
of
look
at
the
overall
picture
it
be
to
consider
the
level
of
FDI
in
2003
,
for
example
.
in
that
year
,
the
proportion
of
IDA
client
win
with
a
research
and
development
component
be
approximately
10
%
,
value
at
€
120
million
.
in
2009
-
10
,
some
50
%
of
FDI
be
research
and
development
investment
and
it
be
value
at
€500
million
.
that
be
one
important
metric
upon
which
we
can
work
.
if
one
consider
the
budget
for
Science
Foundation
Ireland
,
€
15.3
million
,
and
the
collaboration
involve
over
500
company
on
joint
research
initiative
,
one
will
note
the
arrangement
support
€
73
billion
in
export
.
it
be
a
valuable
component
but
we
need
to
consider
further
how
many
indigenous
company
we
can
spin
out
.
we
must
consider
whether
there
be
a
value
to
continue
with
the
investment
in
the
centre
of
excellence
and
research
cluster
.
I
believe
there
be
because
it
maintain
a
vital
FDI
component
because
of
the
collaboration
with
industry
.
one
must
take
cognisance
of
the
investment
in
basic
research
because
,
if
we
do
not
continue
to
invest
in
basic
and
apply
research
,
we
will
not
be
able
to
achieve
the
spin-out
in
the
medium
to
long
term
.
we
need
to
ensure
we
get
the
balance
right
between
the
investment
in
basic
and
apply
research
,
maintain
Science
Foundation
Ireland
investment
through
the
cluster
and
centre
of
excellence
and
try
to
set
metric
or
target
.
progress
from
basic
research
into
the
commercialisation
field
remain
a
challenge
.
we
must
ask
where
it
be
good
for
the
State
to
invest
.
this
conversation
be
take
place
and
will
continue
.
the
hosting
of
the
event
will
cost
€
6
million
.
the
Exchequer
contribution
over
the
period
2009
to
2012
be
to
be
€
2.973
million
.
the
funding
provide
for
2011
be
base
on
the
2009
decision
by
the
previous
government
.
one
will
not
know
the
win
until
the
event
take
place
;
they
can
not
be
project
.
we
want
to
use
the
event
as
a
showcase
for
Irish
science
and
research
across
all
the
discipline
.
let
we
consider
the
next
EU
framework
programme
,
which
I
be
tell
should
be
call
Horizon
2020
rather
than
Framework
8
.
if
we
be
involved
in
this
programme
in
its
early
stage
,
we
will
be
able
to
influence
funding
line
by
virtue
of
the
enhance
reputation
we
hope
to
gain
as
a
result
of
the
host
the
event
,
which
will
attract
top
researcher
and
scientist
from
across
the
world
.
there
will
be
a
win
for
tourism
in
that
5000
delegate
will
be
bring
to
the
Convention
Centre
Dublin
.
there
be
potential
for
delegate
to
spend
up
to
€
4.8
million
,
accord
to
one
estimate
,
and
to
raise
€
1.1
million
in
taxation
.
there
be
a
win
by
virtue
of
hold
the
event
itself
but
there
will
be
a
further
medium
-
term
gain
because
of
the
reputation
enhancement
.
to
what
be
the
deputy
refer
?
I
might
have
to
revert
to
the
deputy
on
that
.
I
have
no
explanation
for
that
at
present
.
forgive
I
for
not
be
able
to
answer
in
the
first
instance
.
the
figure
of
€
8.5
million
include
a
new
programme
of
€
2.5
million
bear
from
the
enterprise
platform
programme
which
be
transfer
from
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
.
it
be
fund
from
current
fund
.
I
can
get
deputy
O'Dea
a
more
comprehensive
explanation
in
writing
.
a
total
of
20
company
and
eight
research
group
win
new
contract
for
2010
amount
to
€
10
million
.
there
be
a
return
on
the
investment
.
I
visit
a
company
,
SensL
,
in
Cork
recently
,
which
be
do
work
in

space
.
the
subhead
support
indigenous
industry
and
start
-
up

one
would
have
have
a
healthy
scepticism
about
this
.
I
believe
we
be
get
the
return
on
the
investment
.

,
I

we
be
press
she
office
as
much
as
possible
to
try
to
have
the

in
as
timely
a
fashion
as
possible
.
while
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
give
a
definitive
timeframe
,
I
be
cognisant
of
the
need
to
ensure
we
get
all
the

as
possible

if
the
deputy
wish
to
check
the
record
,
the
initiation
process
for
this
legislation
be
start
some
time
ago
under
the
previous
government
.
I
be
not
try
to
fudge
the
question
in
any
way
but
I
can
only
speak
about
my
time
as
a
minister
of
State
.
we
be
discuss
committee
stage
of
the
Bill
in
a
new
parliament
that
be
give
a
mandate
this
year
.
I
contend
that
we
be
proactively
engage
with
the
matter
in
hand
.
in
term
of
the
historical
perspective
,
there
be
a
process
of
engagement
and
the
legislation
be
initiate
.
as
to
the
reason
the
Bill
do
not
come
to
committee
,
report
and
final
stage
early
,
one
could
argue
-
again
I
be
not
try
to
fudge
the
question
-
that
be
a
matter
for
previous
administration
.
the
message
we
be
send
today
be
that
the
unitary
patent
be
a
matter
of
European
Union
policy
,
as
agree
by
all
of
the
member
state
.
the
concept
of
the
EU
patent
,
which
be
previously
know
as
the
"
Community
patent
"
be
to
provide
a
patent
system
that
be
affordable
and
devoid
of
administrative
barrier
across
the
member
state
.
we
all
buy
into
that
process
because
it
will
benefit
all
stakeholder
.
any
Irish
business
seek
to
bring
goods
to
market
or
exploit
the
potential
of
they
intellectual
property
and
so
forth
will
be
able
to
do
so
in
a
streamlined
and
consolidate
process
.
we
be
evolve
towards
that
position
.
what
the
Bill
do
be
legislate
for
the
London
agreement
to
which
Ireland
sign
up
.
it
be
another
staging
post
.
the
government
be
actively
grapple
with
this
matter
and
,
as
I
indicate
to
deputy
O'Dea
,
issue
have
arise
in
respect
of
further
engagement
with
the
Attorney
General
.
the
matter
be
ongoing
and
we
be
take
a
proactive
approach
to
it
as
we
be
conscious
of
the
need
to
expedite
the
legislation
.

look

would
be
to
require
the

to
provide
a
up
-
to
-
date
online
register
list
available
teacher
to
the
minister
and
each
vocational

this
would
place
a
additional
requirement
on
the
Teaching

to
monitor
the
availability
of
register
teacher
for
employment
,
which
be
not
appropriate
to

remit

the

role
be
fundamentally
to
regulate
the
teaching

and
therefore
I
will
not
be
accept
this
amendment

there

arrangement
in

to

amendment

11
seek
to
ensure
that
a
person
could
not
be
employ
in
place
of
a
register
teacher
without
this
be
govern
by
ministerial
regulation
.
as
write
,
the
provision
state
that
where
the
minister
be
satisfied
that
it
be
necessary
to
facilitate
the
urgent
temporary
or
occasional
staffing
need
of
recognise
school
,
he
or
she
may
from
time
to
time
prescribe
regulation
govern
the
circumstance
in
which
a
unregistered
person
may
be
employ
in
place
of
a
register
teacher
and
any
condition
that
might
attach
to
that
employment
.
that
condition
could
relate
to
a
maximum
time
limit
for
he
or
she
employment
and
the
purpose
for
which
he
or
she
be
employ

the

do
not
give
the
Minister
discretion
to
do
anything
else
through
which
a
unregistered

could
be

therefore
,
if
the
minister
do
not
make
regulation
specify
the
circumstance
in
which
a
unregistered

may
be
employ
,
such
a
person
cannot
be
employ
.
the
Oireachtas

this
to

no.
11
be
therefore
unnecessary
and
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
it

with
regard
to
amendment
no.
12
,
the
phrase
of
employ
a
unregistered
person
"
in
place
of
a
register
teacher
"
be
use
in
certain
place
in
the
new
section
24
,
in
subsection
8
(
a
)
,
10
(
a
)
and
10
(
f
)
.
however
,
there
be
also
reference
to
teaching
position
in
subsection
9
(
a
)
,
10
(
a
)
and
10
(
b
)
.
the
reality
be
that
in
the
very
limited
exception
in
which
the
employment
of
a
unregistered
person
will
be
permit
,
that
person
will
be
engage
in
a
teaching
post
.
the
wording
be
simply
design
to
reflect
this
.
the
fact
that
a
person
employ
in
such
a
post
do
not
make
he
or
she
a
teacher
.
the
amendment
propose
be
therefore
unnecessary
and
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
it
.
we
must
defer
to
the
expertise
of
the
deputy
in
this
area
.
if
one
be
to
look
at
the
Teaching
Council
,
one
could
argue
that
the
Teaching
Council
and
this
committee
should
have
a
qualitative
analysis
of
the
role
of
the
Teaching
Council
in
May
.
I
do
not
want
to
be
controversial
.
some
22
of
37
member
of
the
Teaching
Council
be
teacher
or
be
ally
to
the
teaching
profession
through
representative
organisation
.
rather
than
the
State
or
the
Department
deal
with
qualitative
issue
,
the
conversation
could
happen
in
the
committee
.
with
due
respect
to
deputy
Mitchell
O'Connor
,
I
cannot
comment
on
the
outcome
or
the
number
of
people
who
vote
in
election
.
I
take
the
point
that
the
low
turnout
may
reflect
a
certain
annoyance
.
the
way
to
deal
with
this
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
suggest
it
,
be
for
the
committee
to
engage
with
the
Teaching
Council
on
its
qualitative
role
.
with
22
of
the
37
member
of
the
council

to
the
teaching
profession
,
many
thing
can
be
work
out
.
the
new
board
be
in
situ
,
which
should
give
grounds
for
hope
.
it
could
serve
as
a
potential
new
departure
in

with
the
issue

Maureen
O’Sullivan
raise

Smith
's
comment
,
qualification
for
entry
to
the

set
by

Teaching
Council

the

have
the
power
to
determine
what
qualification
the

should
have

we
readily
accept
there
be
a

with

it
will
take
time
for
the

and
we
accept
the
concern
raise
by
the

to
work
through
the
issue
.
there
be
a
dialogue
to
be
have
on
this
point
.
it
be
a
continue
challenge
.
I
will
relate
this
point
to
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
,
deputy
Quinn
,
to
see
how
it
can
be

be
set
up

point

,

I
be
happy
to
facilitate
the
process
or
relay
the
message
to
ask
the
minister
to
communicate
directly
on
that
issue
.
it
be
a
technical
amendment

not
a
qualitative
judgment
on

disadvantage

I
do
not
accept

no.

.
the
definition
of
educational
disadvantage
as
currently
lay
down

not
be
amend
but
section
2
of
the
1998
act

amend
to
restore
the
definition

the
rationale
for
section

(
a

of
the
Bill
be
to
safeguard
the
definition
of

disadvantage
as
currently
lay
down

the
provision
in

be
not
to
alter
the
definition

to
include
a
technical
amendment

,
due
to
the
repeal
of

of

,
require

during

my

the

I

the

.
be
the
deputy
suggest
there
will
be
a
change
in
the
status
quo
as
a
result
of
this
Bill
?
as
a
former
principal
,
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
disciplinary
procedure
have
be
in
place
since
2009
.
that
should
answer
she
question
.
no
,
it
will
not
.
this
matter
be
raise
in
the
Seanad
.
the
provision
of
the
Bill
,
combine
with
section
30
of
the
Teaching
Council
Act
2001
,
prohibit
the
payment
of
a
person
employ
as
a
teacher
in
a
school
unless
he
or
she
be
a
register
teacher
.
the
only
exception
be
where
,
due
to
urgent
,
temporary
or
occasional
staffing
need
,
it
be
necessary
to
employ
a
unregistered
person
.
therefore
,
the
pay
of
a
teacher
be
stop
if
he
or
she
registration
lapse
.
the
Bill
do
not
provide
for
a
direction
to
dismiss
a
teacher
who
be
not
register
.
protection
for
school
against
a
unfair
dismissal
claim
along
the
line
be
advocate
by
this
amendment
would
be
arbitrary
and
disproportionate
.
it
would
mean
that
a
person
whose
registration
lapse
for
even
one
day
could
be
dismiss
summarily
and
without
recourse
to
the
employment
appeal
Tribunal
.
the
circumstance
which
may
arise
may
be
as
vary
as
a
teacher
allow
he
or
she
registration
to
lapse
for
a
small
number
of
day
due
to
a
circumstance
where
a
individual
do
nothing
about
get
register
.
where
a
person
be
unregistered
for
a
small
number
of
day
but
then
become
re-register
,
he
or
she
should
be
able
to
return
to
he
or
she
job
.
where
there
be
a
long
period
during
which
the
unregistered
person
be
prevent
from
be
pay
by
the
State
,
he
or
she
may
wish
to
avail
of
unpaid
leave
,
such
as
a
career
break
,
to
gain
the
necessary
qualification
to
become
register
with
the
Teaching
Council
.
under
this
circumstance
,
no
termination
of
the
employment
of
the
unregistered
person
take
place
.
he
or
she
simply
cannot
be
pay
from
Oireachtas
fund
while
he
or
she
remain
unregistered
.
if
a
teacher
allow
he
or
she
registration
to
lapse
and
absent
himself
or
herself
from
school
without
approval
,
establish
grievance
and
disciplinary
procedure
may
be
follow
to
resolve
the
matter
.
even
in
this
scenario
a
person
should
still
expect
to
have
the
normal
law
protection
,
include
access
to
the
employment
appeal
Tribunal
for
a
unfair
dismissal
claim
.
interpose
the
minister
in
the
employment
contract
by
essentially
permit
the
immediate
dismissal
with
impunity
of
a
teacher
who
have
allow
he
or
she
registration
to
lapse
run
counter
to
the
concept
of
equal
treatment
and
fair
procedure
.
a
one
-
size
-
fit
-
all
approach
would
be
unjust
.
give
employer
a
licence
to
dismiss
teacher
without
scrutiny
must
constitute
a
indiscriminate
attack
on
they
employment
rights
.
for
this
reason
,
I
do
not
propose
to
accept
the
amendment
.
to
respond
first
to
deputy
Smith
's
point
on
further
education
,
section
30
only
apply
to
teacher
in
recognise
school
and
do
not
apply
to
teacher
in
further
education
setting
that
be
not
,
if
one
will
,
recognise
school
.
I
hope
that
address
he
point
.
on
deputy
Crowe
's
point
,
while
we
can
examine
some
of
the
scenario
that
could
arise
,
to
be
honest
there
be
no
ambiguity
about
the
manner
in
which
we
have
respond
to
the
amendment
tab
by
deputy
Smith
.
as
I
state
,
interpose
the
minister
in
the
employment
contract
by
essentially
permit
the
immediate
dismissal
with
impunity
of
a
teacher
who
have
let
he
or
she
registration
lapse
would
run
counter
to
the
concept
of
equal
treatment
.
the
government
be
cognisant
of
the
rights
of
employee
and
I
hope
deputy
Crowe
and
he
party
will
give
due
regard
to
this
issue
,
as
they
be
do
to
a
certain
extent
.
while
I
do
not
see
how
the
scenario
the
deputy
describe
could
arise
,
if
he
forese
certain
other
scenario
arise
,
perhaps
he
will
notify
they
to
the
Department
and
we
will
respond
accordingly
.
while
I
do
not
wish
to
open
a
discussion
on
this
matter
,
if
someone
be
dismiss
,
he
or
she
be
potentially
dismiss
with
good
reason
,
have
go
through
all
the
machinery
or
architecture
of
the
State
.
I
be
still
a
little
unclear
as
to
what
exactly
the
deputy
have
in
mind
in
this
regard
.
I
understand
he
position
in
term
of
ensure
the
legislation
be
watertight
,
and
the
bona
fide
of
he
point
be
secure
in
that
sense
.
if
there
be
specific
scenario

in
the
12
month
since
the
last
estimate
process
,
we
have
be
engage
in
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
that
be
chair
by
Mr.
Jim
O'Hara
,
formerly
of
Intel
.
we
have
quite
literally
strip
down
the
area
of
prioritisation
into
14
specific
area
.
while
I
do
not
believe
I
need
to
outline
what
that
area
be
,
they
vary
from
future
network
in
communication
to
innovation
in
service
and
business
process
.
what
we
have
be
seek
to
do
in
the
past
12
month
be
to
move
into
a
space
whereby
there
be
a
close
alignment
between
academia
,
through
the
research
component
,
and
industry
in
order
that
we
can
move
a
new
metric
into
the
fray
,
namely
,
the
effective
creation
of
job
.
that
be
what
have
be
inform
government
policy
in
this
period
.
that
research
prioritisation
exercise
have
give
rise
to
another
exercise
,
the
prioritisation
action
group
,
which
will
be
chair
by
myself
.
its
purpose
be
to
look
at
the
14
area
of
focus
in
the
research
prioritisation
exercise
and
to
drive
a
agenda
to
find
how
we
can
get
that
alignment
between
research
and
industry
in
a
way
that
create
the
job
while
also
seek
to
get
more
accurate
measurement
of
the
impact
of
research
,
for
example
,
with
regard
to
analyse
the
spend
for
research
and
innovation
across
various
programme
and
how
we
can
drive
new
enterprise
and
job
arise
from
that
.
that
process
be
ongoing
as
we
speak
.
it
be
a
interdepartmental
approach
involve
all
of
the
funding
agency
for
research
,
such
as
HEA
,
SFI
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
so
on
.
the
group
have
meet
twice
and
be
look
at
the
various
theme
.
we
have
already
look
at
medical
device
and
food
for
health
and
we
be
now
move
into
sustainable
food
production
and
processing
.
we
will
move
through
each
of
the
theme
individually
.
we
be
also
move
to
create
a
intellectual
property
protocol
so
there
be
a
standardisation
across
all
of
the
high
education
institute
.
if
we
be
create
intellectual
property
through
the
high
education
system
,
we
need
to
ensure
everybody
be
sing
from
the
same
hymn
sheet
and
there
be
a
clear
understanding
,
because
of
the
various
culture
that
exist
between
different
academic
institution
,
of
what
intellectual
property
be
and
how
it
be
mine
for
a
national
usage
to
create
that
type
of
company
,
innovation
and
job
we
need
to
create
.
we
be
on
target
on
the
EU
programme
,
framework
programme
7
.
we
have
draw
down
approximately
€360
million
and
we
target
be
approximately
€600
million
.
we
be
on
target
to
reach
that
.
the
next
framework
be
Horizon
2020
,
which
be
chair
by
we
commissioner
,
Mrs.
Máire
Geoghegan
-
Quinn
.
we
seek
to
ensure
that
from
the
propose
€
85
billion
spend
we
can
influence
how
the
call
be
make
.
there
be
significant
bilateral
engagement
ongoing
currently
and
we
be
hopeful
that
we
will
reach
a
high
target
than
the
€600
million
already
espouse
.
we
be
also
move
to
launch
the
research
centre
programme
.
in
essence
,
we
be
try
to
see
great
consolidation
.
we
have
come
from
a
position
where
,
in
the
mid
1990
-
former
minister
,
deputy
Martin
,
roll
out
the
original
programme
-
we
be
build
capacity
through
the
capital
spend
and
through
the
programme
for
research
in
third
level
institution
,
PRTLI
,
to
now
where
we
be
seek
to
move
the
research
community
with
we
in
a
way
that
ensure
that
everybody
realise
we
need
to
create
more
job
and
that
we
realise
the
importance
of
the
FDI
infrastructure
here
.
as
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
say
already
,
increasingly
more
of
the
investment
be
predicate
on
the
pre-exist
research
infrastructure
.
it
be
no
long
just
about
corporate
tax
anymore
,
but
as
much
about
one
's
footprint
across
research
,
science
,
technology
,
innovation
and
research
and
development
and
innovation
.
that
metric
and
how
the
government
fund
that
area
be
as
important
a
indicator
for
inward
investment
.
what
we
be
try
to
do
be
to
create
a
great
indigenous
space
of
the
type
of
company
that
we
be
fund
so
that
we
rebalance
the
ship
in
a
way
that
create
more
sustainable
indigenous
Irish
company
that
can
compete
on
a
global
scale
.
this
be
a
high
level
overview
of
where
we
be
currently
.
on
the
last
question
,
there
have
be
a
increase
in
the
number
of
company
that
have
take
up
innovation
voucher
through
Enterprise
Ireland
.
what
we
be
seek
to
do
be
to
continue
along
that
vein
,
but
also
to
encourage
small
business
,
with
50
people
or
few
,
to
engage
more
with
the
research
infrastructure
.
very
often
Irish
-
own
business
,
particularly
family
business
,
do
not
move
into
that
space
.
this
business
be
often
in
the
service
sector
and
do
not
see
any
need
for
interfacing
with
academia
.
however
,
if
they
have
a
relationship
with
Enterprise
Ireland
and
be
create
new
innovation
,
new
intellectual
property
or
new
type
of
service
,
they
will
have
the
opportunity
to
avail
of
this
innovation
voucher
.
there
be
approximately
651
collaborative
innovation
between
industry
and
third
level
in
2011
,
but
I
do
not
have
the
breakdown
on
this
to
hand
.
on
the
science
,
technology
and
innovation
side
,
the
chance
be
that
if
business
in
the
SME
sector
have
a
relationship
with
Enterprise
Ireland
and
be
in
the
scientific
or
research
related
field
,
they
will
have
a
relationship
with
one
of
the
research
entity
,
either
the
strategic
research
cluster
or
the
centre
for
science
,
engineering
and
technology
.
I
hope
this
address
the
deputy
's
point
.
I
want
to
be
satisfied
the
deputy
be
okay
with
that
response
.
there
be
a
increase
last
year
,
above
the
target
level
for
2011
.
the
output
target
for
2012
be
610
,
which
be
low
than
the
2011
figure
,
but
towards
the
end
of
last
year
there
be
a
massive
increase
.
we
must
remember
it
be
a
demand
-
lead
scheme
.
with
regard
to
any
of
the
company
employ
50
people
or
few
to
which
I
talk
,
what
one
seek
to
do
be
to
try
to
encourage
they
,
through
Enterprise
Ireland
,
to
see
whether
there
be
scope
within
they
individual
entity
for
a
relationship
with
the
RDI
programme
,
the
institute
of
technology
,
ucd
,
ucc
or
whatever
.
the
more
of
that
relationship
that
be
establish
,
the
more
likely
we
will
,
through
the
innovation
voucher
system
,
get
some
sort
of
a
new
process
or
product
which
will
create
the
job
we
badly
need
.
on
the
Patent
Office
,
it
be
previously
include
under
the
administrative
subhead
,
but
it
now
have
its
own
subhead
under
programme
b
.
the
reduction
be
account
for
by
a
reduction
in
pay
.
it
should
be
process
100
%
of
patent
,
but
forgive
I
for
not
have
a
direct
answer
.
it
be
a
demand
lead
provision
,
so
if
demand
be
down
,
activity
will
be
down
.
with
regard
to
the
PRTLI
,
there
have
be
a
significant
reduction
in
construction
cost
on
that
.
as
a
result
of
expenditure
cutback
,
we
have
have
to
make
cut
also
.
instead
of
have
a
pro
rata
cut
across
the
board
,
we
have
remove
three
structural
PhD
programme
for
2011
and
have
defer
they
.
we
will
consider
they
again
in
the
context
of
the
2013
programme
.
I
have
the
title
of
the
three
programme
and
can
supply
they
to
the
deputy
late
.
in
my
area
,
where
ucc
and
CIT
be
base
,
it
be
easy
for
industry
to
get
access
to
the
institution
.
the
Rubicon
and
Nimbus
centre
be
base
in
CIT
and
ucc
run
the
IGNITE
programme
,
which
encourage
interaction
between
industry
,
start
-
up
business
and
the
academic
institution
.
it
depend
on
which
way
one
look
at
the
case
of
a
small
business
that
want
to
innovate
.
a
company
that
want
to
innovate
and
create
something
new
will
go
to
the
city
or
county
enterprise
board
or
Enterprise
Ireland
.
be
deputy
Tóibín
suggest
the
institute
should
come
out
and
engage
with
the
business
?
the
creation
of
a
liaison
office
be
very
easy
.
I
would
be
very
surprised
if
there
be
not
someone
who
interact
with
business
on
a
daily
basis
,
through
Dundalk
it
,
in
the
region
deputy
Tóibín
be
talk
about
.
it
be
a
very
good
idea
.
come
from
Cork
and
have
a
eye
to
what
be
happen
in
the
country
,
I
see
it
in
operation
throughout
the
region
on
a
daily
basis
.
if
I
understand
the
deputy
correctly
,
it
be
a
mechanism
through
which
county
enterprise
board
can
have
a
eye
on
what
be
happen
academically
.
we
can
explore
that
and
I
be
prepared
to
talk
to
deputy
Tóibín
about
it
.
the
Department
have
a
open
mind
on
the
engagement
.
if
deputy
Tóibín
be
say
there
be
a
deficit
in
the
Navan
and
Meath
area
,
we
should
examine
it
to
see
if
a
improvement
can
be
make
.
this
be
a
apolitical
space
so
the
more
idea
we
have
come
from
the
committee
on
make
the
system
more
beneficial
for
user
,
the
good
.
I
freely
acknowledge
that
previous
government
start
out
on
this
road
and
we
must
give
due
recognition
.
I
also
give
due
recognition
to
the
visionary
people
within
the
Department
,
who
interface
with
we
agency
every
day
and
play
the
ground
hurl
on
this
.
the
University
of
Limerick
have
the
Lero
software
centre
,
which
be
a
global
leader
perform
world
-
class
research
.
the
Government
and
SFI
have
invest
€
16
million
in
the
Irish
Software
Engineering
Research
Centre
.
the
key
to
such
centre
be
collaboration
.
its
partner
include
DCU
,
Dundalk
it
,
NUIG
,
TCD
,
UCD
and
UL
.
there
be
also
a
interface
with
the
industry
.
the
SFI
cset
award
be
augment
to
the
tune
of
€
6.4
million
by
IBM
Ireland
,
Intel
,
QAD
,
Kugler
Maag
CIE
and
Movidious
.
that
be
the
system
we
be
try
to
ensure
work
.
the
Irish
Software
Engineering
Research
Centre
consider
theme
such
as
water
management
,
smart
city
,
transport
infrastructure
and
ensure
output
will
be
influence
by
academic
pursuit
,
industry
and
societal
need
.
I
refer
to
smart
city
and
the
issue
of
water
which
be
very
prevalent
.
the
smart
use
of
water
and
the
application
of
technological
advance
to
the
delivery
of
water
and
use
Lero
,
the
Irish
Software
Engineering
Research
Centre
,
as
a
example
,
there
be
a
societal
or
beneficial
outcome
which
will
ultimately
benefit
the
economy
.
I
may
not
have
fully
answer
deputy
Toíbín
's
question
.
three
more
research
centre
be
plan
and
I
apologise
if
I
do
not
state
this
in
my
initial
reply
.
one
centre
be
for
cloud
computing
and
€
1.2
million
funding
be
announce
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
in
April
.
there
be
provision
for
the
learning
technology
centre
to
be
establish
in
June
this
year
.
it
be
hope
the
financial
service
centre
will
also
be
establish
this
year
but
some
background
work
still
remain
to
be
do
.
Enterprise
Ireland
be
work
on
a
structure
for
regional
gateway
.
to
be
helpful
to
the
deputy
,
I
suggest
he
might
engage
with
Enterprise
Ireland
with
regard
to
he
own
specific
area
.
the
European
Space
Agency
be
a
hardy
perennial
.
approximately
22
Irish
company
and
at
least
12
research
group
be
involved
in
space
-
related
activity
.
in
term
of
we
investment
of
€
14.779
million
in
the
agency
,
research
carry
out
in
2008
show
that
the
financial
investment
to
the
economy
of
we
investment
of
approximately
€
13.5
million
in
the
agency
in
2007
be
approximately
€
21
million
in
foreign
investment
.
in
a
recent
survey
of
30
company
involve
with
the
European
Space
Agency
there
be
19
respondent
which
report
growth
increase
in
value
term
from
€
51
million
in
2008
to
€
71
million
in
2010
and
they
project
it
will
increase
by
up
to
€
168
million
by
2014
.
I
can
name
two
company
in
this
area
with
which
I
be
familiar
,
Radisen
Diagnostics
and
TreeMetrics
.
they
be
both
start
-
up
company
effectively
,
but
Radisen
Diagnostics
be
fund
by
the
European
Space
Agency
.
it
develop
a
point
-
of
-
care
bloodtesting
device
and
it
will
be
use
in
the
International
Space
Station
.
the
fact
that
its
diagnostic
device
be
be
use
in
the
final
frontier
have
a
beneficial
impact
because
if
it
be
rubber
-
stamp
up
there
,
the
company
will
see
a
massive
growth
in
its
sale
potential
.
it
will
benefit
from
the
kudo
attach
to
the
use
of
its
device
there
.
while
I
would
have
be
among
the
sceptics
in
question
the
value
of
we
membership
at
the
beginning
,
there
be
a
qualitative
impact
from
the
spend
of
approximately
€
14.7
million
in
term
of
the
number
of
job
it
create
.
the
number
employ
in
Radisen
Diagnostics
will
increase
from
13
to
approximately
35
in
2013
.
one
can
imagine
the
impact
on
the
economy
of
the
creation
of
35
job
.
I
,
we
Department
and
the
government
believe
that
the
spend
be
worth
it
because
there
be
a
return
to
the
domestic
economy
.
TreeMetrics
be
in
the
business
of
forest
inventory
management
and
it
be
develop
new
overseas
market
.
as
a
result
of
it
get
a
grant
from
the
European
Space
Agency
,
it
project
the
number
it
will
employ
in
2012
will
be
€
16
million
or
16
people
.
it
also
work
with
Coillte
.
the
member
be
all
still
awake
at
this
stage
.
the
net
point
be
that
while
membership
of
the
European
Space
Agency
might
seem
to
be
something
that
be
quite
esoteric
and
one
might
wonder
why
we
should
invest
in
it
,
the
proof
of
the
pudding
be
that
it
be
generate
job
in
the
Irish
economy
.
it
be
help
Irish
company
to
grow
they
business
,
they
output
be
increase
in
monetary
term
,
and
they
be
create
new
job
.
that
be
the
bottom
line
.
we
have
to
go
by
the
2007
figure
,
which
be
the
late
one
I
have
available
.
for
a
spend
of
€
13.5
million
in
2007
,
we
have
a
return
of
€
21
million
.
that
be
the
most
recent
figure
I
have
but
we
will
try
to
get
more
up
-
to
-
date
figure
.

I

for
the
opportunity
to
speak
on
amendment
no.

.
WhatsApp
be
go
to
ask
new
user
to
confirm
that
they
be
aged
16
year
,
Facebook
will
ask
child
between
13
year
and
15
year
to
nominate
a
parent
or
guardian
to
grant
permission
,
child
who
do
not
have
parental
permission
for
Facebook
will
see
a
generic
version
of
Facebook
that
be
not
customise
,
base
on
they
personal
datum
.
this
show
that
child
will
continue
to
have
access
to
the
Internet
,
but
they
datum
will
not
be
exploit
.
set
the
digital
age
at
16
year
will
not
mean
that
a
13
year
old
cannot
use
Facebook
,
which
I
be
use
as
a
example
,
however
,
it
will
mean
that
Facebook
can
not
use
the
13
year
old
.
the
child
will
be
protect
from
target
advertising
derive
from
personal
datum
.
this
be
not
so
different
from
the
rule
place
a
ban
on
advertisement
target
at
child
in
the
offline
world
,
include
broadcasting
.
the
point
be
that
while
people
may
make
the
argument
that
no
matter
whether
the
age
of
digital
consent
be
set
at
13
year
or
16
year
,
the
technology
be
not
yet
available
to
check
age
verification
at
this
stage
and
that
a
young
person
of
13
year
could
pretend
to
be
old
.
we
be
put
a
onus
on
social
media
company
to
ensure
they
be
adhere
to
a
clear
legal
guideline
;
they
be
not
allow
to
exploit
the
datum
of
somebody
within
that
age
cohort
for
commercial
purpose
.
that
be
the
protection
we
be
seek
to
put
in
place
.
we
all
agree
with
the
argument
of
prominent
people
like
Dr.
Geoffrey
Shannon
on
the
issue
of
child
protection
.
one
could
argue
that
the
drafter
of
the
UN
Convention
on
the
rights
of
the
Child
could
not
possibly
have
foreseen
company
like
Facebook
and
WhatsApp
,
commercial
company
that
can
exploit
child
and
use
they
information
.
they
can
use
they
name
,
address
and
date
of
birth
and
geot
they
;
they
know
exactly
where
they
be
and
have
access
to
all
of
they
photograph
.
they
can
use
that
information
for
nefarious
purpose
and
most
definitely
drive
they
bottom
line
.
what
we
be
seek
to
do
in
put
forward
this
amendment
be
to
keep
in
line
with
many
other
European
country
that
be
also
in
this
space
.
that
state
be
interpret
the
regulation
from
the
European
Union
.
we
be
also
seek
to
ensure
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
child
aged
13
to
16
year
be
be
exploit
and
they
information
be
be
use
to
commercial
advantage
.
we
wish
to
put
the
onus
back
on
social
media
company
.
I
repeat
that
WhatsApp
and
Facebook
have
already
announce
they
intention
to
adopt
a
uniform
approach
in
line
with
that
take
in
other
European
country
in
how
they
use
datum
.
they
be
put
protocol
in
place
to
that
effect
.
I
,
therefore
,
ask
the
government
to
accept
a
digital
age
of
consent
of
16
year
on
the
basis
that
the
market
seem
to
be
move
in
that
direction
.
social
media
company
be
move
in
that
way
and
we
should
not
be
behind
the
curve
in
how
we
interpret
the
regulation
.
we
should
at
least
be
on
it
,
if
possible
.
we
will
conclude
for
today
.
we
will
resume
consideration
of
the
Bill
tomorrow
afternoon
in
committee
room
1
.
we
be
a
little
shy
of
50
amendment
-
we
be
on
amendment
no.
49
.
there
be
248
or
250
amendment
in
the
whole
thing
.
we
have
one
fifth
of
the
amendment
do
.
if
we
find
ourselves
at
that
pace
tomorrow
,
we
will
be
in
some
trouble
.
I
,
too
,
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
statement
on
the
need
for
further
legislative
solution
to
the
regulation
of
gambling
,
particularly
in
respect
of
the
licensing
and
registration
of
casino
.
I
think
all
of
we
in
this
House
would
like
to
see
a
compendium
of
legislation
that
deal
with
all
the
issue
,
particularly
online
.
mobile
technology
be
now
move
at
such
a
pace
that
regulation
in
certain
area
be
soon
outmode
by
dint
of
advance
in
technology
.
we
should
therefore
take
a
overarching
view
.
I
seek
clarification
on
this
amendment
.
I
note
the
Minister
of
State
's
comment
on
the
1956
Act
.
I
would
like
he
confirmation
on
the
follow
question
.
since
the
Bill
do
not
speak
specifically
to
private
member
's
club
,
could
it
be
say
-
and
I
will
be
guide
by
the
chairman
on
this
-
that
one
would
in
effect
,
by
dint
of
support
this
amendment
,
be
make
new
law
if
one
be
to
seek
to
amend
the
Gaming
and
Lottery
Act
?
nonetheless
,
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
's
statement
in
the
round
.
it
be
he
misspent
youth
.
I
welcome
the
withdrawal
of
the
amendment
to
allow
for
a
further
discussion
on
this
.
three
cent
to
€
10
per
spin
or
per
game
be
a
significant
increase
.
as
legislator
,
we
must
consider
the
exception
that
can
be
create
,
no
matter
what
type
of
figure
one
put
on
the
cost
per
game
and
the
prize
money
.
when
legislate
for
specific
figure
,
no
matter
what
figure
one
put
in
,
even
if
it
be
low
,
one
must
not
drive
people
into
other
form
of
gambling
.
the
advocate
from
the
public
health
point
of
view
,
such
as
Mr.
Barry
grant
and
Dr.
Colin
O'Gara
,
have
make
a
legitimate
case
in
term
of
this
specific
figure
.
we
have
listen
to
they
in
that
regard
.
it
will
be
a
busy
summer
.
if
I
may
,
I
would
like
to
seek
clarification
from
the
proposer
of
both
amendment
.
would
the
effect
of
the
amendment
be
such
that
if
my
neighbour
,
who
be
of
pensionable
age
and
like
the
odd
flutter
on
a
Saturday
night
,
and
who
might
purchase
a
lottery
ticket
but
also
like
to
go
to
the
booky
to
bet
on
two
or
three
number
,
be
prevent
from
have
that
flutter
?
would
this
be
the
effect
of
both
amendment
?
in
effect
,
the
booky
would
no
long
be
allow
to
take
bet
on
the
outcome
of
lottery
number
.
before
report
Stage
,
could
the
Minister
of
State
provide
statistic
on
the
opportunity
cost
of
the
facility
to
bet
on
the
Lotto
number
in
a
bookmaker
's
?
determine
the
cost
be
quite
difficult
,
and
possibly
insurmountable
—
I
do
not
know
.
one
would
have
to
go
into
every
single
bookmaker
's
shop
in
the
country
and
seek
to
measure
the
revenue
arise
from
bet
on
the
Lotto
number
on
Wednesday
and
Saturday
night
.
I
be
not
sure
how
feasible
that
be
.
the
Minister
of
State
might
have
a
response
to
my
remark
nonetheless

I
ask
the
Minister
of
State
to
set
out
the
government
's
rationale
for
introduce
a
two
-
year
period
for
retain
datum
in
the
case
of
telephony
and
a
one
-
year
period
in
the
case
of
internet
datum
.
I
seek
a
clear
view
of
the
government
's
position
in
this
matter
before
justify
my
amendment
.
with
respect
,
I
ask
the
minister
to
speak
to
my
amendment
in
order
that
I
could
then
respond
.
I
presume
that
I
be
entitled
to
respond
to
the
government
's
justification
for
its
position
on
the
Bill
.
the
Minister
of
State
's
justification
for
the
government
's
position
,
vis
-à
-
vis
the
two
-
year
retention
period
for
telephony
and
the
one
-
year
retention
period
for
Internet
datum
,
be
on
the
basis
of
security
and
counter
-
terrorism
measure
.
I
understand
that
rationale
and
no
one
would
argue
against
it
,
but
I
take
issue
with
the
time
period
.
that
be
the
reason
we
have
seek
to
have
they
reduce
from
two
year
to
one
and
from
one
year
to
six
month
,
respectively
.
in
the
context
of
the
transposition
of
a
directive
that
date
back
to
2006
,
one
speak
to
the
historical
context
of
that
directive
and
also
refer
to
any
subsequent
legislation
enact
that
have
more
than
adequately
deal
with
counter
-
terrorism
or
crime
prevention
measure
such
as
the
criminal
Justice
(
Surveillance
)
Act
.
I
be
look
at
the
permutation
of
the
government
's
position
vis
-à
-
vo
the
cost
to
business
.
I
submit
that
place
on
internet
service
provider
or
telephony
company
a
obligation
that
they
must
store
datum
for
two
year
would
result
in
a
undue
cost
burden
.
one
will
not
have
a
impact
in
term
of
crime
prevention
or
detection
if
one
have
exist
legislation
on
surveillance
.
the
average
period
in
Europe
for
the
retention
of
datum
vary
.
in
France
there
be
a
one
-
year
time
period
.
in
Germany
it
be
six
month
.
Holland
,
Luxembourg
,
the
Czech
Republic
and
Romania
all
favour
a
six
-
month
period
also
.
we
should
be
mindful
of
where
we
be
come
from
.
we
be
talk
about
the
transposition
of
a
directive
,
therefore
,
let
we
look
at
the
historical
perspective
.
we
must
consider
whether
there
be
a
necessity
to
have
the
period
at
two
year
and
one
year
,
respectively
.
I
submit
that
there
be
not
.
I
ask
the
government
to
examine
the
industry
-
wide
position
,
which
be
significant
because
of
the
cost
burden
on
business
that
will
have
a
impact
on
Irish
business
,
and
also
the
average
retention
period
across
the
European
Union
.
all
I
ask
be
that
the
Minister
of
State
look
at
that
matter
and
report
back
on
report
stage
.
the
period
of
retention
apply
with
a
view
to
protect
one
's
human
rights
could
equally
be
short
.
there
be
no
restriction
in
this
regard
.
nobody
argue
against
the
need
to
protect
human
rights
.
I
be
not
sure
if
the
Minster
of
State
understand
my
point
.
if
,
for
instance
,
one
refer
to
the
Internet
as
relatively
new
technology
and
consider
all
the
various
component
,
include
social
networking
website
,
and
factor
such
as
the
number
of
e-mail
one
receive
and
the
number
of
hit
on
website
,
one
will
realise
that
,
by
extend
the
timeframe
,
one
be
build
into
the
legislation
a
mechanism
whereby
internet
service
provider
and
telephony
company
will
be
subject
to
a
cost
burden
.
let
I
be
clear
that
nobody
argue
against
the
principle
of
datum
storage
.
my
point
on
short
timeframe
in
other
member
state
be
base
on
the
fact
that
,
if
this
state
have
short
timeframe
and
ours
be
the
long
allowable
,
we
be
put
ourselves
at
a
comparative
disadvantage
relative
to
the
other
country
compete
on
a
e-commerce
platform
with
this
country
.
one
must
bear
in
mind
a
average
person
's
Internet
usage
,
include
the
number
of
website
visit
and
whether
the
person
use
Bebo
,
Facebook
,
Twitter
or
other
such
website
.
if
all
the
hit
must
be
store
by
the
isp
,
this
impose
a
undue
cost
on
it
.
to
finish
my
point
,
if
it
be
to
be
prove
that
a
individual
visit
a
particular
website
or
that
a
message
be
send
from
person
a
to
person
b
over
the
Internet
,
through
Facebook
or
otherwise
,
one
be
impose
a
cost
on
the
isp
.
it
be
a
question
of
competitiveness
.
we
have
long
since
move
on
from
the
directive
in
term
of
the
threat
pose
prior
to
its
instigation
.
the
government
be
now
go
too
far
down
the
line
.
I
do
not
argue
this
point
from
a
civil
liberty
perspective
but
from
a
economic
and
cost
to
business
perspective
.
the
ability
of
the
Garda
to
investigate
be
already
well
meet
by
exist
surveillance
legislation
.
if
one
add
a
six
-
month
or
one
-
year
period
in
regard
to
telephony
and
internet
access
,
it
would
be
more
than
adequate
.
will
the
minister
of
State
reconsider
this
matter
and
revert
to
I
on
report
stage
?
it
be
unrelated
to
the
legislation
.
chairman
,
may
I
—
—
let
we
revert
to
the
amendment
.
if
one
take
that
example
—
—
the
Minister
of
State
distinguish
between
the
content
and
the
store
of
datum
.
let
I
finish
the
point
,
as
I
also
wish
to
make
that
distinction
.
the
datum
must
be
store
.
I
agree
that
the
content
of
a
message
or
e-mail
be
the
subject
of
a
different
point
.
I
also
agree
that
one
must
store
datum
on
the
interaction
or
communication
between
two
party
.
however
,
discuss
a
murder
investigation
be
not
realistic
.
thanks
to
the
surveillance
act
,
I
guarantee
the
Minister
of
State
that
he
argument
on
this
legislation
will
not
prove
valid
.
most
of
the
information
glean
from
communication
via
telephony
will
have
be
glean
within
a
period
of
one
year
or
six
month
.

I

if

request
come
in
and
if
it
be
as
wide
range
as
a

determine
it
should
be
,
then
we
have
to
be
mindful
of
the
cost
to
the
service
provider
in
yield
up
that
information
.
before
the
Minister
of
State
throw
the
criminal
investigation
argument
at
I
,
I
be
try
to
speak
to
common
sense
.
we
do
not
want
a
chief
superintendent
or
a
officer
of
the
Revenue
commissioner
come
in
with
a
disclosure
request
that
be
not
focus
,
not
narrow
,
or
not
target
.
they
may
trawl
the
net
as
wide
as
possible
.
some
degree
of
common
sense
should
be
apply
whereby
they
be
mindful
of
the
cost
to
the
isp

the
telephone
company
.
there
be
no
fund
available
to

company
to
meet
the
cost
of
the
storage
of
this
datum
,
unlike
in
the
UK
.
there
would
obviously
be
a
imply
cost
to
they
to
provide
the
datum
.
we
effectively
want
a
degree
of
common
sense
.
do
the
minister
of
State
agree
with
I
?
the
memorandum
of
association
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
refer
be
only
a
memorandum
of
association
and
it
be
not
on

footing

it
be
not

up

section
7
state
:
"
a
service
provider
shall
comply
with

disclosure
request
make
to
the
service
provider
"
.
one
of
the
party
to
the
memorandum
of
association
be
the
Internet
Service
Provider
Association
of
Ireland
,
ISPAI
.
its
submission
on
this
legislation
state
that
section
7
be
far
too
wide
and
unwieldy
and
take
no
account
of
what
be
reasonable
,
technically
possible
and
not
very
expensive
.
its
recommendation
be
that
a
provider
shall
comply
with
a
disclosure
request
make
to
the
service
provider
only
where
it
be
technically
possible
and
reasonable
in
scope
,
namely
,
that
the
request
be
not
so
wide
as
to
be
very
expensive
to
service
.
my
amendment
be
base
on
the
wording
of
the
submission
of
the
ISPAI
on
this
legislation
.
I
understand
what
the
Minister
of
State
be
say
about
the
memorandum
of
understanding
.
Active
stakeholder
from
the
telephony
and
Internet
service
provider
buy
into
the
process
.
we
will
make
the
assumption
that
they
action
arise
from
this
be
base
on
common
sense
.
we
be
lawmaker
and
I
be
a
little
concerned
about
this
provision
.
it
could
be
take
advantage
of
to
trawl
too
widely
.
the
memorandum
of
understanding
may
not
have
any
bear
because
,
once
the
request
be
make
,
there
be
no
recourse
to
law
.
if
a
internet
service
provider
be
meet
by
a
request
for
disclosure
,
the
Internet
service
provider
must
adhere
.
there
be
no
sanction
against
the
service
provider
for
not
adhere
.
I
take
the
subtlety
of
the
point
.
Ireland
be
a
small
country
and
if
I
be
a
internet
service
provider
and
I
be
phone
by
the
local
chief
superintendent
ask
for
certain
information
,
I
be
hardly
go
to
refuse
.
if
that
person
be
of
a
mind
to
trawl
the
net
widely
and
I
find
it
technically
difficult
to
come
up
with
that
information
within
a
reasonable
timeframe
,
that
create
problem
.
the
Minister
of
State
refer
to
the
designate
judge
and
the
oversight
judge
.
one
must
consider
the
action
of
that
judge
over
the
past
number
of
year
and
consider
whether
that
person
have
the
resource
to
investigate
the
application
of
the
act
under
which
the
judge
operate
.
since
the
position
be
create
in
1993
,
it
can
be
argue
that
this
consist
of
no
more
than
a
single
line
every
year
state
that
the
operation
of
the
act
have
be
keep
under
review
and
its
provision
have
be
comply
with
.
there
have
be
no
discussion
of
the
step
take
to
keep
the
operation
of
the
act
under
review
,
whether
individual
file
be
review
,
the
volume
of
surveillance
be
carry
out
and
whether
mistake
be
make
in
carry
out
surveillance
.
this
concern
the
report
on
the
criminal
Justice
(
Terrorist
Offences
)
act
2005
,
under
which
there
be
a
designate
judge
.
I
presume
this
provision
have
the
same
arrangement
.
in
principle
,
the
oversight
judge
be
a
fantastic
concept
.
whether
the
judge
have
the
resource
to
carry
out
the
provision
to
which
the
Minister
of
State
refer
be
a
moot
point
.
I
oppose
this
provision
.
can
I
interpret
from
this
that
the
Minister
of
State
will
review
it
for
report
stage
?
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
response
.
I
move
amendment
no.

between

to
insert
the
follow
subsection
:
"
(4
)
a
report
under
this
section
shall
contain
detail
of
the
number
of
prosecution
actually
commence
as
a
result
of
investigation
to
which
request
related
,
and
a
detailed
justification
for
any
significant
excess
of
number
of
request
over
number
of
prosecution
actually
commence
.
"
.
the
justification
for
this
amendment
be
that
it
speak
to
a
qualitative
provision
we
be
try
to
work
into
the
legislation
which
would
ensure
justification
for
a
request
for
disclosure
to
rule
against
the
possibility
of
request
for
disclosure
for
nefarious
purpose
.
we
be
try
to
ensure
that
if
a
innocent
person
become
the
subject
of
a
disclosure
request
that
a
numerical
value
be
put
on
it
in
the
sense
of
the
quantity
of
request
make
.
one
can
then
examine
the
number
of
prosecution
and
tally
up
the
ratio
of
request
make
to
prosecution
.
we
be
try
to
ensure
a
degree
of
transparency
in
the
provision
under
the
section
.
we
be
also
seek
to
offset
the
risk
of
somebody
use
the
provision
in
the
law
for
wrongful
purpose
I
strain
to
understand
the
Minister
of
State
's
logic
.
he
speak
about
vindicate
individual
rights
but
the
amendment
highlight
a
potentially
gross
disparity
between
number
of
request
and
the
ensuing
prosecution
.
he
refer
to
review
of
the
working
of
the
directive
.
we
seek
to
protect
the
rights
of
individual
in
respect
of
whom
disclosure
be
request
.
under
the
Bill
as
it
stand
,
a
individual
can
only
find
out
if
a
disclosure
request
have
be
make
by
first
make
a
request
to
the
data
Protection
Commissioner
on
the
basis
that
he
or
she
believe
personal
datum
have
be
access
.
we
seek
to
require
that
a
report
be
prepare
which
contain
detail
of
the
number
of
prosecution
commence
as
a
result
of
request
for
information
.
we
want
quantitative
rather
than
qualitative
assessment
.
such
a
provision
would
offset
the
risk
of
somebody
in
a
position
of
power
seek
disclosure
for
purpose
other
than
the
investigation
of
a
criminal
,
revenue
or
secret
service
matter
.
we
be
try
to
balance
the
need
for
datum
against
the
rights
of
the
individual
.
I
will
consider
withdraw
the
amendment
if
I
can
be
assure
that
we
will
further
discuss
the
issue
arise
on
report
stage
.
I
accept
the
Minister
of
State
's
objection
in
good
faith
.
he
acknowledge
the
aim
of
the
amendment
.
I
move

this

complaint
procedure
in

be
not
back

the

I
both
know
he
be
lessen
the

a
innocent
person

a

it

I

I
agree
there
must
be

as
we
all
do

the
