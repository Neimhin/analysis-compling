the

which
would
be
bad
for
Ireland
and
for
Irish
commerce
generally

section

,
which
re-enact

,
ensure
that
company
which
do
not
have
at

one
director
who
be
resident
in

EEA
state
must
put
in

a
bond
,
in
the
prescribe
form
,
that
become
payable
to
a
person
nominate
by
the
registrar
or
the
Revenue
commissioner
.
the
purpose
of
the
bond
be
to
discharge
any
fine
impose
on
the
company
in
respect
of
a
offence
commit
by
it
and
prosecutable
by
the
registrar
or
for
the
purpose
of
discharge
certain
fine
and
penalty
impose
on
it
by
the
Taxes
Consolidation
Act

.
the
money
can
also
be
use
to
cover
expense
that
be
reasonably
incur
in
the
collection
of
say
penalty
.
the
bond
can
not

any
other
purpose

therefore
,
the
amendment
propose
do
not
achieve
any
legitimate
policy
goal

they
sole
effect
be
to
create
a
arbitrary
restriction

non-eea
company
try

in

context
,
the

will
not
support
the
amendment

the

have
not
say
anything
with

I
would

there
be

this
section
contain
the
form
of
director
's
compliance
statement
as
recommend
by
the
company
law
review
group
.
have
analyse
the
provision
contain
in
the
2003
Act
,
the
group
determine
that
such
extra
duty
,
as
set
out
in
the
act
,
would
do
little
to
increase
compliance
.
in
fact
,
it
would
actually
result
in
a
increase
in
red
tape
at
significant
cost
to
business
.
the
set
-
up
cost
to
a
business
be
estimate
at
€
90000
with
the
ongoing
annual
cost
at
€
40000
.
a
streamlined
version
of
the
director
's
compliance
statement
propose
by
the
group
remove
the
requirement
that
the
statement
include
a
declaration
that
the
company
have
comply
with
all
other
enactment
that
could
affect
its
financial
performance
.
this
be
find
to
be
the
most
burdensome
aspect
of
the
statement
,
as
well
as
the
least
relevant
as
company
be
already
legally
oblige
to
comply
with
all
act
.
they
inclusion
in
the
statement
do
not
add
any
substantive
duty
.
a
majority
of
the
group
,
include
member
represent
the
Financial
Regulator
and
other
public
body
,
agree
to
a
more
balance
version
of
the
statement
.
there
be
a
strong
EU
impetus
towards
less
unnecessary
regulation
to
make
EU
business
more
competitive
.
this
amendment
would
create
unjustifiable
and
disproportionate
cost
on
Irish
business
without
add
value
in
term
of
protection
and
would
disadvantage
Ireland
competitively
as
it
would
go
beyond
other
country
and
perhaps
beyond
the
regime
north
of
the
Border
.
the
director
's
compliance
statement
as
it
stand
have
broad
support
from
industry
and
regulator
alike
.
for
this
reason
,
it
be
intend
to
preserve
the
director
's
compliance
statement

DCS
,
as
it
currently
stand

on

basis

the

subsection
(

of
section
28
of
the
company
Act
1990
have
not
be
include
and
the
amendment
rectify
the
position
.
I
be
give
to
understand
that
a
company
's
tax
compliance
can
be
check
out
with
the
Revenue
commissioner
,
but
the
chair
may
correct
I
on
that
.
we
do
not
support
the
amendment
,
but
I
believe
compliance
can
be
check
.
perhaps
we
can
provide
some
clarification
on
that
.
this
be
not
a
logical
inclusion
in
a
company
's
financial
statement
,
but
the
deputy
may
have
allude
to
this
in
he
statement
defend
the
amendment
.
Financial
statement
relate
to
the
company
's
financial
performance
,
not
to
its
tax
obligation
.
fiscal
accounting
address
tax
obligation
.
if
the
government
be
to
consider
a
requirement
to
require
business
to
obtain
and
publish
a
certificate
of
tax
compliance
,
it
would
do
so
in
tax
law
,
not
company
law
,
in
order
to
catch
both
company
and
non-company
business
that
also
pay
tax
.
the
introduction
of
this
requirement
would
be
entirely
without
precedent
across
the
European
Union
.
it
be
on
that
basis
the
we
do
not
propose
to
support
the
amendment
.
I
move
amendment
no.

to
be
helpful
,
my
intention
be
to
suggest
we
should
look
into
it
.
on
the
face
of
it
,
the
amendment
make
sense
,
but
in
the
age
of
cloud
computing
and
remote
server
it
would
place
a
imposition
on
business
because
the
amount
of
physical
storage
facility
they
would
have
to
make
available
could
be
restrictive
if
locate
in
city
centre
location
,
for
example
.
many
small
office
be
locate
in
city
centre
location
where
space
be
at
a
premium
and
would
be
unable
to
cope
with
store
the
volume
of
record
that
would
require
to
be
store
.
the
amendment
would
substantially
hinder
or
block
outright
the
use
of
share
service
centre
,
a
area
in
which
Ireland
have
a
particular
interest
.
since
there
would
be
no
tangible
benefit
for
any
stakeholder
and
it
would
be
detrimental
to
Irish
commerce
,
the
amendment
be
-
I
do
not
want
to
use
the
word
"
undesirable
"
-
not
one
we
support
.
I
move
amendment
no.

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.
section
19
deal
with

section
19
(

)
allow
a
court
to
make
a
attachment
of
earnings
order
to
a
person
in
receipt
of
a
social
welfare
payment
.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we

as

know

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the

to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into
account
some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

I
welcome
the

my

and
I
welcome
the

will
be

however
should
the

get

Sinn

will

further

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little

in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative

.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the

.
should
it

we
will
work

to
take

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in

my

I
welcome

however
should
the

Sinn

will

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little

in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative

,
include

restorative

mediation
programme
,
both
within

alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

restorative

be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we

to
the
behaviour
of

partner

this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this

reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this

I
reiterate
my
initial

that
we

we

of

my

however

Sinn

will

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little

in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
it
identify

or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a

rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into

in

we
be
commit
to
expand

include

restorative

mediation

,
both
within

the

North

although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit

should

the

of

have

,
the

this

suggest
that

something
we

definitively
support

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the
deputy
to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

I

my

the

if

look

restorative

can

it

nowhere

it

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as

know
,
social

payment
be
often
calculate
in

.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a

be
make
in

,
there
be
a

that
the

will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he

partner

parent

this
be
one
area
we
would

of

,
we
will
work
constructively

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in

for

we
would

as

know

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the

to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

I

my

I
welcome

however
should
the

Sinn

will

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary

welfare
payment

do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get

,
we
will
work

to
take

some
of
the

I
have
outline
in

my

I
welcome

however
should
the

Sinn

will

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a

restorative

be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution

to
the

or
the
victim
's

it

anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a

Sinn
Féin
see
a

important
role
for

in

system
across

we
believe
that
in

it

more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community

in

meantime

restorative

be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this

be
a
chance
that
the
partner

child
of
the

will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of

partner

parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to

should
this

reach

of

,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the

on
that

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative

.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this

I
reiterate
my
initial

that

we

my

Sinn

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little

in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative

,
include

restorative

mediation

,
both
within

alongside

system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

restorative

be

approach
to
respond

that
enable

of

act

to
the

or
the
victim
's

or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative

,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within

alongside
the
exist

system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the

should
be

be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the

to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

I

my

it

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this

raise
question

as

know

social

be
often
calculate

I
and
my

would
worry
that
where

there
be
a

unfairly

behaviour
of

we

of

we
will
work
constructively

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or

could
not
survive

this

as

know

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the

to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in

I

my

Sinn

I
will
speak

about
this
a

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative

,
include
community
restorative

and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in

to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for

to

raise
question

as

know
,
social

be
often

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the
deputy
to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into
account
some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

.
I
welcome
the
introduction
of
this

commend

on

my
party
and
I
welcome
the
spirit
of
this

and
will
be
support
its

to

however
should
the
Bill
get
to
that
stage
,
Sinn

will
seek
to
amend
it
in

to
strengthen
it
further
.
I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in
my

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution

reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's

both

it

crime

anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a

against
the

.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for

in
the
justice
system
across
the

because
we
believe
that
in

case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in

meantime

we

expand

restorative

restorative

be

approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and

behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or

harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or

to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's

or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative

,
include
community
restorative

and

mediation
programme
,
both
within

alongside
the
exist

system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be

be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent

it

worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this

.
should
it

,
we

some
of
the

I

my

I
welcome

however
should

Sinn

will

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little

in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the

of
restorative

,
include

restorative

mediation

both
within

alongside

system
North

South

although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a

rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and

in

we
be
commit
to
expand

restorative

within

although
we
may

with
the

that
that
who

have

,
the

in
which
this

suggest
that

not
something
we

definitively
support

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in

to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee

.
should
it
get

we

of

this
be
another
area
of

in

for

to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict

be
place
on
attachment

.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a

order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative

,
but
attach
a
order
for

to
someone

salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative

in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative

practice
have
come
on
in
leap

bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty

County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint

on
Justice
,
Defence

be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this

I
reiterate
my
initial

that

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this

raise
question

as

know

social

be
often
calculate

I
and
my

would
worry
that
where

there
be
a

unfairly

of

we

we
will
work
constructively

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's

or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation

he

raise
question

as

know
,
social

be
often
calculate

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely

the

to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in

I

Sinn

I
will

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in

to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be

it

raise
question
.
as

know
,
social

be
often
calculate
in

to

.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the
deputy
to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into
account
some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my
contribution
.
I
welcome
the
introduction
of
this
Bill
to
the

and
commend
deputy
Halligan
on

preparation
of
it
.
my
party
and
I
welcome
the
spirit
of
this
Bill
and
will
be
support
its
progress
to
committee

.
however
should
the
Bill
get
to
that
stage
,
Sinn
Féin
will
seek
to
amend
it
in
order
to
strengthen
it
further
.
I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in
my
contribution
.
restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution

reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's

both

it

crime

anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a

Sinn
Féin
see
a

important
role
for

in
the
justice
system
across
the

because
we
believe
that
in

case
it

more
socially
effective

retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community

in

meantime

we

expand

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty

six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint

welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely

it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in

I
welcome
the

my

and
I
welcome
the

will
be

however
should
the

get

Sinn

will
seek

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the

of
restorative

restorative

within

system
North

although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

restorative

to

to

's

.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative

,
include
community
restorative

and

mediation
programme
,
both
within

alongside
the
exist

system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be

be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work

it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have

in

the

if

attach

certainly
not

in

restorative

have
come

here
in

to

although
there
some

we
have
much
more
work
to

indeed
,
the

be
look
at

although
restorative

can
be
very

intensive
,
it
be
nowhere

costly
as
incarcerate
people

non-violent

.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to

I

that

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

as

social

I

there
be

be
also
the
worry
that
if

cut
far
enough
into

,
one
could
leave
he

Sinn

see

role

we
believe
that
in

case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive

as
it
result
in
high

a

as

social

be

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work

some
of
the

I

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in

to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment

be
make
in

of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this

reach
the
next

.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the

on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached

raise
question
.
as

know
,
social

be
often
calculate

.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the
deputy
to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into
account
some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my
contribution
.
I
welcome
the
introduction
of
this

to

commend

on

my
party
and
I
welcome
the
spirit
of
this

and
will
be
support
its

to

however
should
the
Bill
get
to
that
stage
,
Sinn
Féin
will
seek
to
amend
it
in
order
to
strengthen
it
further
.
I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in
my
contribution
.
restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or

act

Sinn

see
a

retributive

it

in
high

satisfaction

a

a
great

of

rehabilitation

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.

social
welfare
payment
.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely

to

it
and
to
take
into

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

.
I
welcome
the
introduction
of
this

to
the

commend

on

preparation

my
party
and
I
welcome
the
spirit
of
this

and
will
be
support

however
should
the
Bill
get
to
that
stage
,
Sinn

will
seek
to

to
strengthen

further

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in
my

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the

of
restorative

restorative

both
within

system
North

although
we
may

loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence

should

the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

section

(

allow
a
court
to
make
a
attachment
of
earnings
order
to
a
person
in
receipt
of
a
social
welfare

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the
deputy
to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into
account
some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social

payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative

.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap

bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty

County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint

on
Justice
,
Defence

be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative

in

I
reiterate
my
initial

that

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative

,
include
community
restorative

mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

Sinn

see
a

important
role

we
believe
that
in

case
it
be
more
socially

retributive

as
it
result
in

a

as

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or

partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work

to
take
into

some
of
the

I

can

it

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in

to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a

be
make
in

of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner

of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or

partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this

reach

of

,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the

on
that

there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative

this
could
actually
have
the

as

know
,
social

be
often
calculate

I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the

to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into
account
some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

I
welcome
the
introduction
of
this

my
party
and
I
welcome
the

of

will
be

however
should
the

get
to
that
stage
,
Sinn

will
seek
to
amend

to
strengthen

further

I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in

restorative

the

be
look
at

although
restorative

can

very
labour

intensive

it
be
nowhere

costly
as
incarcerate

it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration

I

that

we

my

however

Sinn

I
will
speak

about
this
a
little

in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty

County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this

a
court
to
make
a
attachment
of
earnings
order
to
a
person
in
receipt
of
a
social
welfare
payment
.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
should
it
get
there
,
we
will
work
closely
with
the
deputy
to
strengthen
it
and
to
take
into
account
some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my
contribution
.
I
welcome
the
introduction
of
this
Bill
to
the

and
commend
deputy

on

preparation
of
it
.
my
party
and
I
welcome
the
spirit
of
this

and
will
be
support
its
progress
to

however
should
the
Bill
get
to
that
stage
,
Sinn

will
seek
to
amend
it
in

to
strengthen
it
further
.
I
will
speak
further
about
this
a
little
late
in
my
contribution
.
restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.

some
of
the
concern
I
have
outline
in
my

I
welcome
the

commend
deputy

on

preparation

my
party
and
I
welcome
the

will
be

however
should
the

get

Sinn

will

I
will
speak

about
this
a
little

in

restorative
justice
be
a
approach
to
respond
to
criminal
and
other
harmful
behaviour
that
enable
the
perpetrator
of
a
criminal
or
other
harmful
act
to
offer
restitution
or
reparation
to
the
victim
or
the
victim
's
community
or
both
.
it
identify
crime
or
anti-social
behaviour
as
a
act
against
a
individual
or
community
rather
than
against
the
State
.
Sinn
Féin
see
a
increasingly
important
role
for
restorative
justice
in
the
justice
system
across
the
island
because
we
believe
that
in
a
great
many
case
it
be
more
socially
effective
than
retributive
justice
as
it
result
in
high
victim
satisfaction
,
a
low
incidence
of
repeat
offending
and
a
great
chance
of
offender
rehabilitation
and
reintegration
into
the
community
.
in
the
meantime
,
we
be
commit
to
expand
and
improve
the
use
of
restorative
justice
,
include
community
restorative
justice
and
community
mediation
programme
,
both
within
and
alongside
the
exist
justice
system
North
and
South
.
although
we
may
agree
loosely
with
the
idea
that
that
who
commit
offence
of
theft
should
pay
back
the
cost
of
the
goods
they
have
steal
,
the
manner
in
which
this
Bill
suggest
that
the
money
should
be
recoup
be
not
something
we
could
definitively
support
.
section
19
deal
with
attachment

a

have
fail
to
pay

section
19
(

)
allow
a
court
to
make
a
attachment
of
earnings
order
to
a
person
in
receipt
of
a
social
welfare
payment
.
this
automatically
raise
question
.
as
member
know
,
social
welfare
payment
be
often
calculate
in
regard
to
household
.
I
and
my
party
would
worry
that
where
a
attachment
order
be
make
in
respect
of
a
offender
,
there
be
a
chance
that
the
partner
or
child
of
the
offender
will
suffer
unfairly
due
to
the
behaviour
of
he
or
she
partner
or
parent
.
this
be
one
area
we
would
seek
to
amend
should
this
Bill
reach
the
next
stage
.
of
course
,
we
will
work
constructively
with
the
deputy
on
that
.
there
be
also
the
worry
that
if
one
cut
far
enough
into
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
,
one
could
leave
he
or
she
in
a
situation
in
which
he
or
she
could
not
survive
financially
,
and
this
be
another
area
of
concern
to
we
.
in
order
for
this
Bill
to
be
fair
,
we
would
need
to
work
to
ensure
that
strict
condition
be
place
on
attachment
order
.
we
must
also
be
mindful
of
the
danger
of
place
a
attachment
order
on
someone
who
be
already
struggle
to
be
a
upstanding
citizen
and
the
possibility
that
,
rather
than
be
restorative
,
this
could
actually
have
the
opposite
effect
,
cause
someone
to
become
more
detached
from
society
.
if
both
party
agree
to
such
a
mechanism
then
it
be
fair
to
call
it
restorative
justice
,
but
attach
a
order
for
payment
to
someone
's
salary
or
social
welfare
payment
who
do
not
want
to
pay
be
certainly
not
what
we
would
know
as
restorative
justice
.
in
the
North
of
Ireland
restorative
justice
practice
have
come
on
in
leap
and
bound
,
but
here
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
we
have
much
more
to
do
.
although
there
some
good
example
across
this
State
,
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
.
indeed
,
the
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
be
look
at
this
very
issue
.
although
restorative
justice
can
be
very
labour
-
intensive
,
it
be
nowhere
near
as
costly
as
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crime
.
it
be
time
we
start
to
give
real
consideration
to
alternative
strategy
in
this
State
.
I
reiterate
my
initial
point
that
we
support
the

of

in

question
pose
by

as
to
whether
or
not
we
will
take
any
amendment
on

,
the
amendment
be
put
forward
and
we
respond

they

we
have
take
a
clear
position
on
they
and
believe
that
the
legislative
process
be
such
that
it
produce
robust
legislation
.
however
,
there
be
some
point
we
can
consider
for
Seanad
Stage
in
the
Seanad
.
we
may
look
at
the
court
of
jurisdiction
,
which
be
a
area
raise
by
the
deputy
in
connection
with
employee
issue

in
response
to
the
amendment
put
forward
as
they
be
group
,
we
be
not
in
favour
of
adopt
this
amendment
.
we
must
keep
reiterate
that
the
Bill
be
only
concerned
with
company
law
.
in
general
term
,
company
law
concern
itself
with
the
fiduciary
duty
a
director
owe
to
the
company
alone
while
recognise
that
a
director
ought
to
have
regard
to
the
interest
of
he
or
she
employee
.
it
would
be
wholly
inappropriate
to
include
the
propose
provision
in
the
Bill
.
legislation
govern
employee
rights
should
be
consider
in
the
context
of
employment
law
.
we
have
state
this
several
time
in
the
context
of
other
amendment
tab
by
opposition
Deputy
.
by
address
such
a
matter
in
a
company
Bill
,
the
provision
be
not
provide
protection
for
all
employee
,
such
as
sole
trader
or
that
work
in
partnership
.
second
,
employment
law
already
provide
for
redress
in
less
cumbersome
and
costly
fora
than
the
high
Court
.
third
,
and
equally
importantly
,
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
company
law
must
balance
the
rights
of
all
creditor
,
many
of
whom
be
employer
in
they
own
right
,
in
wind
-
up
situation

I
appreciate
what
the
deputy
be
attempt
to
achieve
with
this
propose
amendment
but
the
simple
fact
be
that
company
law
be
not
the
correct
vehicle
for
this
ambition
.
therefore
,
we
be
not
in
favour
of
this
amendment

suggest
that
a
company
may
be
wind
up
in
court
where
it
owe
a
employee
or
a
group
of
employee
more
than
€
1500
.
the
Bill
set
the
limit
at
€
10000
,
as
it
be
consider
that
a
great
balance
and
proportionality
must
be
achieve
in
circumstance
where
the
severe
sanction
of
wind
-
up
be
concerned
.
the
section
do
not
distinguish
between
a
employee
and
any
other
creditor
.
in
the
circumstance
,
any
creditor
be
entitle
to
issue
a
letter
demand
payment
and
if
,
after
21
day
,
such
payment
have
not
be
receive
the
creditor
be
entitle
to
petition
the
high
Court
.
I
be
sure
the
deputy
present
can
appreciate
that
petition
the
high
Court
be
not
a
simple
or
low
-
cost
exercise
.
it
would
have
to
be
question
whether
wind
-
up
be
really
the
most
effective
way
to
settle
a
debt
of
€
1500
.
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
there
be
provision
in
both
employment

well

this
also
apply
to

company
.
in
relation
to
subsection
(
3
)
and
(
4
)
of
the
amendment
,
it
would
be
costly
to
set
up
a
public
register
of
the
type
set
out
,
in
particular
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
information
be
already
available
by
other
means
.
currently
,
there
be
no
requirement
to
report
this
information
to
the
cro
.
in
this
regard
,
the
deputy
refer
to
the
possibility
of
the
introduction
of
legislation
.
the
deputy
be
free
to
introduce
legislation
to
this
House
.
therefore
,
there
would
be
cost
associate
with
this
for
the
cro
and
the
affect
company
.
the
ongoing
cost
to
the
cro
and
affect
company
of
make
and
process
thousand
of
notification
would
be
colossal
.
the
cost
involve
in
delay
to
transfer
of
ownership
in
share
would
be
unacceptably
and
could
interfere
with
the
constitutional
rights
to
private
property
.
that
be
something
we
all
adhere
to
also
.
I
be
not
sure
if
the
deputy
be
suggest
that
we
should
remove
unlimited
company
from
Irish
law
altogether
.
limited
company
serve
many
legitimate
business
purpose
and
be
a
feature
of
company
law
across
the
European
Union
.
just
as
guarantee
company
and
public
limited
company
be
important
for
certain
type
of
business
,
unlimited
company
also
serve
a
important
purpose
.
remove
they
would
be
disproportionate
and
would
,
I
would
argue
,
put
Ireland
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
.
if
the
deputy
would
like
to
remove
the
reporting
exemption
from
unlimited
company
,
other
country
across
the
EU
allow
unlimited
company
to
dispense
with
report
requirement
.
this
be
because
report
requirement
be
impose
as
a
quid
pro
quo
of
limited
.
where
there
be
no
limited
liability
there
be
no
reason
to
require
financial
reporting
.
it
be
very
easy
to
state
that
small
business
have
receive
less
favourable
treatment
than
they
big
counterpart
.
I
will
speak
to
the
amendment
.
we
could
become
involved
in
a
argument
with
regard
to
the
support
available
to
small
and
large
business
.
however
,
as
state
in
reply
to
a
previous
amendment
,
between
250
and
300
individual
who
own
small
business
of
various
size
attend
a
event
in
Cork
yesterday
in
order
to
learn
about
the
business
support
provide
by
over
27
agency
of
the
State
.
factually
,
the
deputy
's
statement
be
just
not
correct
.
in
the
context
of
the
amendment
,
the
law
on
unlimited
company
be
govern
by
EU
directive
and
any
propose
change
to
Irish
law
would
produce
few
,
if
any
,
benefit
for
the
creditor
of
such
company
.
however
,
such
change
would
give
rise
to
a
substantial
cost
to
this
country
in
term
of
its
international
commercial
competitiveness
.
Ireland
be
a
small
island
nation
and
the
foreign
direct
investment
sector
here
be
responsible
for
employ
many
thousand
of
people
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
in
the
context
of
sub
-
supply
or
in
the
provision
of
service
.
the
fact
that
foreign
direct
investment
company
operate
here
give
rise
to
downstream
benefit
,
in
term
of
supply
,
for
many
of
the
small
business
we
be
discuss
.
I
accept
the
deputy
's
concern
with
regard
to
the
ownership
of
unlimited
company
.
this
issue
will
be
deal
with
in
the
come
month
in
the
context
of
the
accounting
directive
,
which
be
due
for
transposition
in
2015
.
the
debate
relate
to
say
directive
be
the
most
suitable
avenue
for
consider
the
issue
raise
by
the
deputy
.
the
primary
aim
of
the
Bill
before
the
House
be
to
consolidate
and
tidy
up
the
exist
law
.
it
be
also
design
to
provide
a
accessible
,
user
-
friendly
framework
for
business
operate
within
we
shore
.
I
reiterate
that
EU
law
do
not
require
report
on
the
part
of
unlimited
company
.
that
be
the
position
in
law
at
present
.
I
move
amendment
no.

anonymity
of

in

company
as
they
name
would
have
to
appear
as
that
of

on

.
a
amendment
have
not
be
tab
on
this
issue
.
without
be
pedantic
,
I
be
not
sure
which
section
would
be
relevant
to
the
matter
to
which
the
deputy
refer
.
the
review
be
ongoing
.
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
consultation
take
place
on
the
matter
,
I
wish
to
read
some
information
into
the
record
of
the
House
.
the
accountancy
profession
be
,
in
general
,
adaptable
and
agile
and
be
able
to
respond
to
new
market
opportunity
and
direction
.
this
be
,
to
a
great
extent
,
because
it
be
not
tie
down
by
layer
of
regulation
.
there
be
detailed
statutory
provision
relate
to
auditing
and
,
to
a
less
extent
,
insolvency
practice
.
the
Competition
Authority
hold
the
view
that
this
be
the
way
thing
should
stay
.
New
regulation
should
only
be
introduce
where
there
be
clear
evidence
of
market
failure
or
very
damaging
consumer
harm
.
that
have
not
be
establish
as
the
position
here
.
when
the
matter
be
review
by
the
Department
at
the
time
of
draft
,
the
view
be
take
that
there
be
no
case
for
introduce
a
system
of
regulation
for
the
profession
generally
.
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
feel
that
introduce
such
a
system
would
put
at
risk
the
flexibility
of
the
profession
and
its
ability
to
respond
to
client
need
,
be
it
in
traditional
area
such
as
tax
advice
or
management
account
or
in
emerge
field
such
as
succession
planning
.
New
layer
of
regulation
could
also
stultify
further
growth
and
innovation
.
have
examine
the
issue
from
the
standpoint
of
the
principle
of
good
regulation
,
the
Competition
Authority
conclude
that
there
be
no
public
interest
case
require
legal
protection
of
the
term
"
accountant
"
.
in
response
to
the
concern
of
the
industry
,
however
,
the
minister
have
agree
to
consult
fully
on
the
matter
.
I
be
inform
that
the
review
will
happen
this
year
but
we
do
not
have
a
definitive
timeline
in
respect
of
it
.
however
,
I
be
not
sure
whether
it
be
agree
that
the
review
would
be
complete
in
advance
of
the
conclusion
of
the
deliberation
on
this
legislation
.
perhaps
deputy
Calleary
have
a
different
view
to
offer
in
that
regard
.
the
Bill
have
by
and
large
be
deal
with
up
to
now
on
the
basis
of
a
consensual
approach
and
I
be
mindful
of
the
need
to
conclude
we
deliberation
on
it
.
I
take
the
point
the
deputy
be
make
with
regard
to
tab
a
amendment
in
the
Seanad
.
in
fairness
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
commit
in
good
faith
to
carry
out
and
conclude
a
review
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
all
party
involve
will
be
consult
.
I
hope
we
can
expedite
the
review
and
that
any
matter
relate
to
it
will
not
delay
the
implementation
of
the
legislation
.

the
late
PISA
report
from
the
OECD

programme
for
international
student
assessment
,
PISA
,
show
that
15

old
student
in
Ireland
perform
at
the
average
level

of

.
Ireland
rank
17th
of
the
28
OECD
country
that
take
part
in
the
study
,
and
22nd
out
of
all
44
participate
country
.
country
like
the
Unite
State
,
Norway
,
Denmark
and
Sweden
perform
similarly
to
Ireland
,
while
Canada
,
Australia
,
Finland
and
the
Unite
Kingdom
perform
significantly
good
than
Ireland
.
the
top
six
performing
country
be
in
Asia
,
with
Singapore
rank
first
.
the
performance
of
Irish
student
on
problem
solving
in
this
PISA
study
be
good
but
there
be
considerable
room
for
improvement
.
project
math
and
the
emphasis
on
skill
development
in
the
new
junior
cycle
student
award
,
JCSA
,
offer
student
and
teacher
new
way
of
thinking
and
learning
that
should
improve
we
15
-
year
-
old
's
problem
-
solve
capability
.
as
have
be
articulate
in
other
answer
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Quinn
,
we
be
move
away
from
a
rote
learning
framework
to
one
which
be
inquiry
-
base
and
which
put
the
student
at
the
centre
of
problem
solving
.
therefore
a
paradigm
shift
be
go
on
.
I
cannot
give
the
deputy
a
answer
regard
the
cost
of
the
digital
strategy
but
I
will
revert
to
he
with
that
information
.
there
will
be
significant
improvement
in
ICT
infrastructure
with
the
roll
-
out
of
broadband
be
available
to
all
second
-
level
school
in
the
autumn
.
the
priority
and
challenge
of
the
digital
strategy
be
currently
be
examine
as
part
of
a
ongoing
consultative
process
.
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
say
we
may
have
to
look
outside
the
Department
concern
the
digital
strategy
and
maybe
incorporate
more
stakeholder
,
include
student
themselves
,
in
meeting
head
-
on
the
challenge
of
PISA
and
learn
from
they
.
as
regards
the
methodology
involve
,
there
be
a
mark
difference
between
paper
-
base
and
computer
-
base
problem
solving
.
we
have
do
extremely
well
vis
-à
-
vis
PISA
on
paper
-
base
problem
.
however
,
there
be
clearly
a
deficit
in
the
presentation
of
scenario
to
student
for
the
purpose
of
PISA
mark
.
one
need
broadband
provision
in
the
first
instance
in
order
to
give
effect
to
a
digital
strategy
.
that
strategy
be
not
yet
under
way
and
work
remain
to
be
do
both
internally
and
externally
.
the
key
purpose
of
this
be
to
ensure
that
student
have
a
proper
understanding
of
the
dynamic
involve
.
person
in
Ireland
be
digital
native
and
instinctively
interface
with
the
technology
both
in
school
and
elsewhere
.
however
,
when
certain
scenario
be
present
to
they
it
show
a
deficit
,
so
we
need
to
discover
why
and
tackle
it
.
that
be
not
merely
a
matter
of
give
more
ipad
or
tablet
to
school
,
it
be
a
question
of
how
the
learning
process
can
be
enhance
as
a
result
of
interaction
with
technology
.
that
be
part
of
the
digital
strategy
which
need
to
be
further
interrogate
.
I
want
to
give
the
deputy
a
proper
answer
.
it
be
not
just
about
throw
money
at
the
problem
,
it
be
also
about
properly
interpret
the
PISA
dynamic
and
compare
the
experience
of
other
country
.
we
can
take
Finland
as
a
exemplar
and
see
how
it
be
do
there
.
we
may
adopt
some
of
that
model
into
a
Irish
system
.
we
be
get
there
but
we
need
to
get
the
ICT
roll
-
out
complete
in
the
first
instance
.
that
be
a
paternalistic
attitude
to
education
.
what
about
parental
responsibility
?

and

(

and

.
the
question
as
tab
relate
to
the
wholesale
and
retail
sector
.
the
late
quarterly
national
household
survey
publish
by
the
CSO
on
26
May
show
that
the
number
of
people
employ
in
the
wholesale
and
retail
sector
fall
by
2200
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
.
we
acknowledge
that
fall
.
it
be
a
very
diverse
sector
and
it
appear
the
experience
be
different
in
different
part
.
in
April
,
overall
,
the
volume
and
value
of
retail
sale
be
up
by
6.8
%
and
4.4
%
on
the
same
period
last
year
.
growth
be
concentrate
in
the
motor
,
furniture
,
clothing
,
hardware
and
electrical
sector
.
by
contrast
,
decline
be
record
in
the
volume
of
activity
in
grocery
,
book
and
newspaper
,
and
pharmacy
.
structural
change
,
such
as
trade
online
,
be
occur
in
the
sector
and
be
undoubtedly
play
a
role
.
on
the
other
hand
,
a
increase
in
the
KBC
-
ESRI
consumer
sentiment
index
for
April
,
which
put
Irish
consumer
sentiment
at
its
strong
level
since
January
2007
,
be
encouraging
.
however
,
the
key
challenge
be
to
translate
this
improvement
into
job
in
the
retail
sector
.
this
year
's
action
plan
for
Jobs
include
a
number
of
measure
to
support
the
retail
sector
.
this
measure
include
the
establishment
of
a
retail
consultation
forum
to
provide
a
platform
for
a
structure
engagement
between
the
retail
sector
and
relevant
Department
and
government
agency
.
its
purpose
be
to
allow
key
issue
of
relevance
to
the
sector
to
be
discuss
,
with
a
view
to
identify
practical
action
which
could
be
take
by
the
government
,
or
by
industry
itself
,
to
support
the
sector
.
the
first
meeting
of
the
forum
will
take
place
on
9
June
.
the
Action
Plan
for
Jobs
also
include
measure
to
address
issue
that
impact
on
cost
competitiveness
in
the
sector
,
the
introduction
of
a
number
of
structural
measure
to
support
the
retail
sector
,
and
the
continuation
of
the
online
trading
initiative
and
the
integrate
licensing
application
system
for
the
retail
sector
.
we
must
acknowledge
that
Irish
shopper
spend
€
3.8
billion
in
online
trading
in
2012
.
some
75
%
of
the
revenue
go
outside
the
State
.
while
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
,
we
must
tackle
this
through
deputy
Tóibín
's
committee
,
which
will
do
some
work
on
town
centre
planning
.
if
we
be
talk
about
retailer
,
which
he
mention
,
it
be
a
question
of
how
town
centre
be
structure
and
how
we
encourage
great
trading
.
I
be
sure
the
work
of
the
deputy
's
committee
will
feed
into
the
retail
consultation
forum
.
it
be
important
to
state
that
the
retail
consultation
forum
comprise
retail
retail
Ireland
,
retail
Excellence
Ireland
,
RGDATA
,
Chambers
Ireland
,
the
small
Firm
Association
and
individual
retail
practitioner
.
through
that
consultation
process
,
we
will
address
issue
like
town
centre
shopping
,
e-commerce
,
drive
more
business
online
from
Irish
retailer
,
and
the
cost
to
business
of
retail
.
there
be
specific
issue
in
the
grocery
sector
that
require
to
be
address
.
we
must
look
at
budget
2015
to
see
if
there
be
any
way
of
enhance
demand
through
the
process
.
we
must
also
look
at
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
2015
,
the
home
renovation
incentive
scheme
and
the
impact
of
the
9
%
vat
rate
.
the
question
tab
by
the
deputy
concern
the
wholesale
and
retail
sector
and
I
be
confident
that
,
through
a
process
of
consultation
involve
all
the
stakeholder
,
thorough
engagement
and
give
effect
to
many
initiative
that
arise
from
the
retail
consultation
forum
,
we
can
work
towards
increase
the
number
of
people
employ
in
the
retail
sector
.
we
wholeheartedly
acknowledge
that
,
year
-
on
-
year
between
2013
and
2014
,
there
have
be
a
drop
of
5,900
in
the
number
of
people
employ
in
the
sector
.
we
must
do
something
to
address
that
decline
and
the
decline
of
we
town
through
the
doughnut
effect
.
the
deputy
refer
to
the
retailer
he
be
meet
and
the
level
of
confidence
.
through
engage
with
that
retailer
and
they
representative
organisation
,
we
can
arrest
the
decline
.
I
be
confident
that
,
once
the
process
start
on
9
June
,
we
will
take
action
.
in
the
three
year
before
the
government
come
into
office
,
more
than
300000
job
have
be
lose
across
the
economy
.
the
construction
,
retail
and
tourism
sector
be
particularly
badly
hit
and
collectively
account
for
over
two
third
of
the
job
loss
.
almost
150000
job
be
lose
in
the
construction
sector
alone
between
the
beginning
of
2008
and
the
beginning
of
2011
.
in
2012
,
the
government
introduce
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
as
the
main
policy
instrument
to
tackle
the
employment
crisis
and
to
assist
job
creation
.
now
in
its
third
annual
iteration
,
the
action
plan
have
set
about
transform
the
operating
environment
for
business
by
seek
to
identify
and
remove
barrier
to
competitiveness
and
by
place
employment
on
the
agenda
of
every
Department
.
the
late
employment
figure
publish
by
the
Central
Statistics
Office
show
there
be
a
increase
of
42700
people
in
employment
in
the
first
quarter
of
2014
,
compare
to
the
first
quarter
of
2013
.
there
be
a
increase
of
63200
in
the
number
in
employment
in
the
last
two
year
.
this
figure
be
net
of
reduction
in
public
sector
number
.
more
than
67
%
of
the
job
create
since
2012
have
be
full
time
.
in
the
last
six
month
,
almost
all
the
job
create
in
the
economy
be
full
time
.
the
sector
that
have
consistently
perform
well
be
agriculture
,
food
and
fishing
,
accommodation
and
food
service
,
tourism
and
professional
,
scientific
and
technical
activity
.
this
sector
have
be
the
focus
for
attention
under
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
.
in
2013
,
Enterprise
Ireland
and
IDA
Ireland
client
company
have
record
year
for
employment
creation
,
generate
a
total
of
12500
net
new
job
in
export
-
focus
activity
.
this
pattern
suggest
the
job
be
create
be
add
value
to
the
economy
and
have
every
potential
to
be
sustainable
.
however
,
we
must
continue
to
focus
on
sector
that
do
not
experience
a
job
recovery
over
the
past
two
year
.
the
wholesale
and
retail
sector
,
which
we
discuss
early
,
continue
to
suffer
job
loss
,
while
the
pattern
be
similar
in
the
construction
sector
.
there
be
move
to
intervene
in
both
sector
.
there
be
a
specific
policy
instrument
for
the
construction
sector
.
construction
2020
set
out
a
series
of
policy
intervention
in
consultation
with
sectoral
representative
regard
how
the
housing
shortage
can
be
address
and
how
the
sector
,
which
take
a
major
hit
,
particularly
in
the
three
year
prior
to
2011
,
can
be
stimulate
.
yes
.
a
specific
initiative
be
under
way
,
particularly
aim
at
the
Dublin
region
,
under
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
.
I
can
engage
further
with
the
deputy
on
this
.
I
understand
from
EI
that
it
have
be
actively
promote
the
site
concern
to
a
number
of
interested
party
.
I
be
not
in
a
position
to
disclose
the
detail
of
that
interaction
for
commercially
sensitive
reason
.
however
,
task
force
have
be
use
in
the
past
as
part
of
a
response
to
a
sudden
loss
of
a
large
number
of
industrial
job
.
more
recently
,
other
initiative
be
increasingly
use
as
a
alternative
to
task
force
.
in
this
regard
,
the
establishment
of
LEOs
,
recently
announce
by
government
,
mean
that
all
category
of
business
,
include
sole
trader
,
micro
business
and
sme
have
access
to
government
support
and
advice
.
the
LEO
be
the
first
-
stop
shop
for
anyone
seek
information
and
support
on
start
or
enhance
a
business
.
the
active
promotion
of
the
site
be
take
place
.
EI
be
actively
engage
in
seek
to
ensure
the
job
that
be
lose
be
replace
.
I
acknowledge
the
point
make
by
the
deputy
in
regard
to
the
effect
of
the
loss
of
a
company
like
this
to
a
town
like
Fethard
.
in
south
Tipperary
,
where
Enterprise
Ireland
be
the
lead
agency
in
effort
to
ensure
we
replace
and
create
job
,
there
be
76
client
company
employ
more
than
2000
people
in
full
-
time
job
.
this
be
the
figure
for
2013
.
in
excess
of
€9
million
worth
of
grant
have
be
pay
to
client
company
since
2011
.
I
assure
the
deputy
that
Enterprise
Ireland
be
work
actively
as
the
representative
State
agency
in
seek
to
ensure
we
can
replace
the
job
that
have
be
lose
.
it
be
actively
promote
the
site
to
a
number
of
interested
party
as
we
speak
.
as
far
as
I
be
aware
,
there
be
no
formal
task
force
work
on
this
,
such
as
the
task
force
for
the
south
east
where
all
the
agency
be
work
together
.
I
assure
the
deputy
,
however
,
that
the
local
agency
be
work
together
.
Enterprise
Ireland
be
the
pre-eminent
State
agency
and
it
be
work
proactively
on
this
.
it
be
promote
the
site
to
a
number
of
interested
party
.
I
ask
the
deputy
to
allow
that
process
to
take
shape
.
I
be
sure
he
will
acknowledge
that
Enterprise
Ireland
be
work
with
interested
party
to
seek
to
replace
the
job
that
have
be
lose
.
the
deputy
should
use
private
member
's
time
to
do
so
.
I
doubt
Sinn
Féin
will
use
private
member
's
time
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
tab
the
question
.
in
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
2014
,
develop
a
good
environment
for
entrepreneurship
be
a
key
disruptive
reform
.
the
work
of
the
Entrepreneurship
Forum
have
be
a
valuable
input
to
identify
area
for
fruitful
initiative
.
the
Department
be
develop
a
national
policy
statement
on
entrepreneurship
.
as
part
of
this
process
,
the
forum
's
recommendation
be
be
evaluate
with
input
from
Department
and
agency
.
already
,
a
significant
number
of
initiative
have
be
take
which
respond
to
the
forum
's
evaluation
.
this
include
the
launch
of
the
local
enterprise
office
,
leo
,
the
initiation
of
a
competition
to
find
and
to
invest
in
the
good
young
entrepreneur
at
local
and
national
level
,
the
creation
of
a
new
ICT
skill
strategy
2014
-
18
,
the
establishment
of
knowledge
transfer
Ireland
and
its
online
database
of
innovative
idea
,
as
well
as
turn
that
idea
that
come
from
intellectual
property
through
the
university
and
institute
of
technology
into
new
company
.
in
addition
,
a
review
of
mentoring
be
be
prepare
by
Forfás
and
a
review
of
tax
support
be
under
way
for
entrepreneur
.
the
initiative
also
include
a
assessment
of
how
the
agency
in
the
Department
can
deliver
target
improvement
in
the
environment
for
business
,
particularly
for
start
-
up
,
and
the
preparation
of
a
strategy
statement
2014
-
16
by
Enterprise
Ireland
with
new
ambition
for
high
-
potential
start
-
up
.
there
be
a
strong
belief
that
the
start
-
up
area
offer
huge
opportunity
for
enhance
performance
and
job
growth
by
the
Irish
enterprise
sector
and
the
government
be
determined
to
facilitate
this
through
a
national
policy
statement
on
entrepreneurship
.
many
of
the
recommendation
make
actually
cut
across
measure
that
be
be
implement
anyway
.
it
be
unfair
to
suggest
that
the
government
be
not
engage
proactively
with
the
recommendation
.
it
acknowledge
wholeheartedly
the
role
play
by
the
chairman
and
individual
member
in
bring
forward
this
recommendation
.
I
can
tell
the
deputy
that
,
internally
,
there
be
no
sense
of
lethargy
about
engage
properly
.
however
,
he
must
acknowledge
that
if
one
be
to
take
all
the
recommendation
,
of
which
there
be
at
least
69
,
one
must
have
some
sort
of
process
to
ensure
the
State
agency
can
respond
and
that
there
be
a
interdepartmental
response
.
as
I
outline
already
in
my
initial
reply
,
the
government
have
launch
the
local
enterprise
office
,
which
will
cut
across
a
lot
of
the
recommendation
make
.
similarly
,
the
ICT
skill
strategy
will
cut
across
a
lot
of
the
recommendation
that
be
make
,
as
will
the
review
by
Forfás
on
mentoring
.
consequently
,
there
be
no
sense
that
the
Department
be
not
engage
with
the
recommendation
.
I
assure
the
deputy
and
that
people
who
have
be
in
contact
with
the
deputy
and
who
may
have
express
concern
that
the
government
be
absolutely
and
utterly
intent
on
ensure
that
the
national
policy
statement
will
reflect
the
view
put
forward
and
the
recommendation
propose
.
I
do
not
answer
the
question
on
the
number
of
people
who
have
be
assign
.
a
number
of
people
have
be
appoint
through
Enterprise
Ireland
in
Asia
,
comprise
ten
new
people
across
Asia
.
I
can
get
a
specific
figure
for
the
deputy
in
respect
of
China
.
to
my
mind
,
the
interdepartmental
approach
work
quite
rapidly
at
present
.
if
one
examine
again
the
recommendation
make
in
the
Entrepreneurship
Forum
report
,
it
be
evident
that
the
government
be
move
rapidly
and
actually
be
ahead
of
some
of
the
recommendation
in
respect
of
outcome
,
particularly
,
for
example
,
with
regard
to
the
high
level
sector
where
there
be
a
strong
move
towards
ensure
that
research
work
in
a
way
that
turn
that
good
idea
into
good
job
.
the
government
have
create
knowledge
transfer
Ireland
and
have
ensure
there
be
more
post
-
doctoral
and
PhD
programme
.
for
instance
,
there
be
specific
arrangement
pertain
to
the
Irish
Research
Council
on
have
more
enterprise
-
face
PhD
programme
.
that
be
one
recommendation
that
already
be
under
way
.
the
point
must
be
make
that
while
the
government
acknowledge
the
recommendation
and
be
work
towards
meet
they
,
it
will
reflect
this
outcome
through
the
national
policy
statement
.
I
thank
the
Deputy
again
for
raise
this
important
issue
.
the
object
of
the
interdepartmental
exercise
be
to
seek
and
uncover
the
truth
,
which
be
not
something
that
can
be
do
overnight
.
the
deadline
we
have
impose
will
ensure
there
be
no
delay
in
deal
with
this
issue
.
deputy
Creighton
and
Keaveney
ask
about
my
contact
with
the
Garda
Síochána
.
I
have
not
initiate
any
such
contact
on
this
matter
.
the
Garda
Síochána
be
a
independent
state
policing
and
investigative
organisation
.
I
do
not
direct
it
on
matter
of
crime
or
seek
to
initiate
criminal
investigation
.
the
force
will
be
expect
to
exercise
judgment
with
regard
to
allege
criminal
activity
in
this
case
,
in
the
same
way
as
it
do
in
respect
of
any
criminal
investigation
.
it
be
important
that
each
department
with
any
involvement
in
the
issue
surround
this
case
be
not
only
consult
,
but
activate
to
take
appropriate
action
.
that
be
the
basis
of
the
interdepartmental
approach
we
be
take
.
this
obviously
will
include
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
,
my
own
Department
,
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
the
Department
of
Health
.
there
may
also
be
a
role
for
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
with
particular
reference
to
the
record
to
which
deputy

it
on
matter
of
crime
or
seek
to
initiate
criminal
investigation
.
the
force
will
be
expect
to
exercise
judgment
with
regard
to
allege
criminal
activity
in
this
case
,
in
the
same
way
as
it
do
in
respect
of
any
criminal
investigation
.
it
be
important
that
each
department
with
any
involvement
in
the
issue
surround
this
case
be
not
only
consult
,
but
activate
to
take
appropriate
action
.
that
be
the
basis
of
the
interdepartmental
approach
we
be
take
.
this
obviously
will
include
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
,
my
own
Department
,
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
and
the
Department
of
Health
.
there
may
also
be
a
role
for
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
with
particular
reference
to
the
record
to
which
deputy
Clare
Daly
refer
,
as
well
as
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
.
in
fact
,
most
Department
will
have
a
involvement
in
this
issue
.
I
will
be
keep
government
inform
as
to
the
progress
of
the
interdepartmental
group
's
work
.
its
report
will
be
present
to
cabinet
by
the
end
of
this
month
,
after
which
we
will
decide
,
at
the
early
opportunity
,
on
the
extent
and
scope
of
further
investigation
and
inquiry
.
the
House
will
have
a
opportunity
to
debate
the
issue
at
that
stage
.
I
assure
deputy
Clare
Daly
that
the
issue
she
raise
,
include
the
document
she
mention
,
will
be
examine
by
the
interdepartmental
group
and
form
part
of
the
current
scoping
exercise
.
I
reiterate
that
I
be
not
rule
anything
out
in
term
of
government
action
on
this
issue
.
I
ask
the
deputy
to
allow
time
and
space
for
the
various
interest
in
the
various
Department
to
do
the
work
that
need
to
be
do
.
they
have
already
have
they
first
meeting
and
a
timeframe
be
in
place
.
I
will
keep
the
House
inform
as
matter

in
the
come
week
.
it
would
be
on
the
cheap
anyway
.

I

to
all
the

must
examine

such
as
the

of

,
the

,
parental

,
the

the

it

not
something

it

the

continue
to
closely
monitor
the
financial
position
with
a
view
to
ensure
that
expenditure
remain
within
the

.
this
government
have

as

however
,

consequently
,
there
be

funding
for

and
summer
work
scheme
be
subject

funding
.
I
agree
with
some
of
the
sentiment
of
the
deputy
.
in
a
perfect
world
,
we
would
have
the
perfect
pot
of
money
to
allow
we
to
do
everything
we
could
within
the
education
sphere
to
ensure
the
amount
of
voluntary
contribution
make
by
parent
through
charitable
donation
and
fundraising
be
lessen
considerably
.
there
be
a
macroeconomic
picture
,
however
,
and
we
must
reduce
the
deficit
to
3
%
by
a
certain
year
.
Fianna
Fáil
subscribe
to
that
philosophy
and
that
mean
the
education
silo
have
a
finite
pot
of
money
.
to
govern
be
to
choose
,
and
we
must
make
choice
about
where
to
allocate
funding
.
with
regard
to
the
comment
about
electioneering
,
deputy
McConalogue
's
party
be
a
dab
hand
at
make
announcement
prior
to
election
.
let
we
take
the
cynicism
out
of
it
and
say
that
we
have
try
to
ensure
we
put
money
into
school
through
the
minor
work
scheme
and
the
summer
work
scheme
where
it
be
necessary
.
some
school
miss
out
because
of
the
prioritisation
process
,
but
they
be
not
be
cut
out
of
the
pot
.
hopefully
,
this
school
will
go
in
the
pot
for
next
year
,
and
it
be
the
intention
,
if
we
be
€500
million
ahead
of
profile
in
term
of
overall
taxation
receipt
,
that
it
will
reflect
positively
on
the
education
budget
.
this
will
allow
we
to
fund
project
such
as
that
outline
in
the
question
.
in
March
2011
,
the
macroeconomic
picture
in
this
country
be
abysmal
and
we
be
a
programme
country
.
however
,
we
have
be
able
to
maintain
the
capital
budget
and
we
have
a
five
-
year
programme
where
we
be
replace
prefab
and
build
new
school
.
therefore
,
in
spite
of
the
economic
circumstance
in
which
we
find
ourselves
,
we
have
be
able
to
build
out
and
replace
the
prefab
that
have
be
in
existence
since
the
height
of
the
boom
.
therefore
,
there
be
no
doubt
the
government
's
commitment
to
try
to
ensure
funding
be
put
in
place
for
necessary
work
.
we
have
not
yet
start
the
proper
discussion
around
budget
2015
.
therefore
,
it
would
be
premature
to
give
a
absolute
commitment
at
this
stage
.
however
,
if
we
have
commit
funding
for
this
year
,
2014
,
and
if
the
economic
profile
be
get
good
,
one
would
be
hopeful
.
that
be
all
one
can
say
.
if
the
deputy
be
stand
where
I
be
stand
,
this
be
what
he
would
be
say
.
we
would
hope
to
be
in
a
position
to
try
to
ensure
that
school
fund
for
the
necessary
repair
and
minor
work
will
be
provide
,
but
we
cannot
say
that
for
certain
until
we
have
get
through
the
negotiation
on
budget
2015
.
the
position
be
that
Ireland
receive
funding
for
a
European
globalisation
adjustment
fund
,
EGF
,
programme
to
support
redundant
worker
from
SR
Technics
.
this
consist
of
a
personalised
package
of
guidance
,
training
,
educational
and
enterprise
support
which
be
deliver
to
the
eligible
worker
concern
during
a
implementation
period
from
March
2009
to
October
2011
.
measure
include
tuition
cost
of
the
ALBA
degree
in
all
Hallows
which
,
normally
be
a
part
-
time
programme
,
be
deliver
on
a
tailor
full
-
time
basis
to
accommodate
the
specific
requirement
of
this
worker
give
the
finite
timeframe
for
EGF
co-fund
support
.
when
this
funding
cease
,
the
Department
provide
a
grant
as
a
once
-
off
measure
to
this
cohort
of
student
to
complete
they
study
.
the
Department
allocate
funding
to
the
HEA
for
direct
disbursement
to
approve
high
education
institute
and
the
internal
disbursement
be
a
matter
for
the
governing
body
.
the
provision
of
course
be
a
matter
for
individual
institution
as
autonomous
body
.
it
be
important
to
state
that
all
Hallows
be
a
private
college
and
be
not
in
receipt
of
core
grant
funding
.
however
,
the
Department
provide
grant
in
lieu
of
tuition
fee
funding
to
the
college
in
respect
of
three
approve
undergraduate
course
.
this
funding
amount
to
over
€
430000
for
the
2013
-
2014
academic
year
in
respect
of
the
119
eligible
student
who
attend
course
for
the
full
year
.
the
ALBA
programme
refer
to
by
the
deputy
be
a
part
-
time
course
and
be
,
therefore
,
not
a
approve
course
for
free
fee
funding
.
a
decision
be
make
to
provide
specific
funding
-
initially
under
the
EGF
and
subsequently
by
means
of
the
grant
scheme
-
to
certain
student
,
namely
,
former
employee
of
SR
Technics
who
undertake
the
course
on
a
full
-
time
basis
.
when
the
EGF
funding
be
withdraw
,
the
Department
agree
to
support
the
full
-
time
qualifying
student
to
complete
they
study
.
this
be
ex-SR
technics
employee
who
be
undertake
the
ALBA
degree
on
a
full
-
time
basis
.
as
already
state
,
the
institution
be
autonomous
body
in
they
own
right
.
I
hope
this
answer
the
deputy
's
question
.
I
be
not
unsympathetic
to
the
case
the
deputy
be
make
,
particularly
in
view
of
the
impact
the
course
have
have
on
that
individual
who
,
as
he
state
,
be
out
of
formal
education
for
such
a
long
period
.
I
contend
that
it
be
not
necessarily
for
the
Department
to
intervene
.
in
circumstance
in
which
a
course
of
this
nature
could
be
provide
by
another
institution
,
I
would
make
the
argument
that
it
would
be
a
matter
for
that
institution
to
subsume
it
into
its
own
programme
of
course
.
a
exception
be
make
.
it
must
be
remember
that
it
be
a
part
-
time
course
and
that
funding
would
not
normally
be
provide
in
such
circumstance
.
the
deputy
refer
to
a
particular
institution
,
but
there
be
any
number
of
institution
throughout
the
State
which
could
,
subject
to
they
internal
criterion
,
subsume
the
course
on
a
full
-
time
basis
.
I
do
not
know
how
the
Department
could
intervene
in
that
matter
.
in
fact
,
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
mechanism
to
allow
it
to
do
so
.
it
be
a
result
of
the
EGF
and
the
specific
circumstance
relate
to
SR
Technics
that
a
intervention
be
make
in
this
instance
,
and
there
be
no
doubt
the
positive
impact
of
that
intervention
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
one
could
set
a
precedent
in
respect
of
any
number
of
other
course
which
could
be
bring
through
the
Department
to
be
deliver
out
into
specific
institution
.
however
,
we
must
recognise
the
autonomy
of
individual
institution
.
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
the
deputy
have
raise
this
issue
previously
.
I
hope
,
therefore
,
that
I
be
not
repeat
the
same
reply
to
the
deputy
.
to
date
,
the
Department
have
not
receive
any
formal
submission
from
parent
in
north
Kildare
on
the
provision
of
a
gaelcholáiste
in
the
north
-
eastern
Kildare
region
.
there
be
a
five
year
construction
plan
which
be
well
establish
.
the
establishment
of
any
new
school
be
,
therefore
,
consider
in
the
context
of
the
overall
need
for
additional
school
place
to
meet
future
demographic
demand
.
the
deputy
have
probably
hear
this
before
.
I
acknowledge
that
there
be
one
post
-
primary
school
in
Maynooth
,
Maynooth
post
-
primary
school
.
a
new
post
-
primary
school
,
Maynooth
community
college
,
will
be
add
to
the
provision
this
September
.
it
will
have
a
all
-
Irish
aonad
,
which
be
the
nub
of
the
issue
.
I
will
sit
down
with
the
deputy
who
may
wish
to
address
that
point
.
as
I
understand
it
,
a
total
of
80
place
be
be
make
available
through
the
aonad
.
if
the
deputy
be
suggest
the
demand
from
the
community
for
a
gaelcholáiste
be
such
that
the
aonad
be
not
a
sufficient
response
,
we
will
have
to
find
a
way
of
facilitate
a
further
conversation
base
on
a
interrogation
of
the
survey
.
the
reply
furnish
to
I
suggest
that
include
in
the
first
year
enrolment
at
the
new
school
will
be
a
allocation
of
31
student
for
the
all
-
Irish
aonad
.
while
there
be
no
waiting
list
for
the
aonad
,
a
additional
85
first
year
place
can
be
fill
in
Maynooth
community
college
.
this
place
can
be
fill
either
in
the
aonad
,
on
the
English
language
side
of
the
school
or
between
the
two
facility
,
depend
on
demand
.
obviously
,
there
be
a
gap
between
what
the
Department
and
the
community
be
say
and
,
somehow
,
we
be
go
to
have
to
work
to
bridge
it
.
I
will
speak
with
the
deputy
after
question
Time
.
I
be
open
to
correction
,
but
it
be
my
understanding
the
Department
have
confirm
that
,
if
be
demonstrate
that
there
be
sufficient
demand
for
education
through
the
medium
of
Irish
in
the
aonad
over
a
four
year
cycle
,
the
establishment
of
a
independent
gaelcoláiste
can
be
consider
.
the
deputy
and
I
will
discuss
the
matter
.
I
be
aware
of
the
concern
of
all
the
patron
of
small
rural
school
,
include
that
of
a
Protestant
etho
.
how
good
to
sustain
provision
for
widely
disperse
and
small
Protestant
community
present
as
a
particular
challenge
,
especially
in
any
locality
where
the
number
enrol
in
the
school
be
decline
to
single
figure
and
amalgamation
be
not
a
option
because
there
be
no
other
school
nearby
.
the
government
be
intent
on
foster
pluralism
in
school
provision
.
support
minority
church
in
maintain
they
school
be
part
of
that
policy
.
nevertheless
,
resource
have
to
be
distribute
to
school
in
a
transparent
and
equitable
manner
.
in
this
regard
,
pupil
number
be
the
fair
basis
on
which
to
allocate
resource
to
a
school
,
irrespective
of
its
type
.
eight
small
school
of
a
Protestant
etho
be
successful
in
they
staffing
appeal
for
September
2014
.
on
the
deputy
's
question
on
dialogue
,
there
be
continue
dialogue
on
ensure
pluralism
within
the
education
system
.
let
I
refer
to
a
specific
example
.
with
the
Bishop
of
Cork
,
Cloyne
and
Ross
,
Dr.
Paul
Colton
,
and
Mr.
Owens
of
Cork
Education
and
Training
Board
,
we
have
in
Mallow
,
where
a
small
Church
of
Ireland
school
close
,
fashioned
a
new
model
that
will
create
a
precedent
for
a
education
and
training
board
to
join
a
Church
of
Ireland
school
in
create
a
brand
new
school
.
what
we
be
talk
about
be
ensure
the
recognition
of
the
faith
and
the
right
of
that
with
that
faith
to
educate
they
community
accordingly
.
we
must
try
to
ensure
there
be
a
model
,
or
model
,
to
allow
this
to
continue
.
it

,
nine
of

therefore
,
there

there
be
no

I
be
very
pleased
to
have
have
the
opportunity
to
pilot
this
Bill
through
both
the
Seanad
and
the
Dáil
.
I
thank
the
Member
of
this
House
and
the
Seanad
for
they
comment
and
what
be
a
fruitful
debate
on
the
Bill
during
its
passage
through
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
the
Bill
be
not
design
to
solve
all
the
issue
affect
the
co-operative
sector
but
to
address
a
number
of
particular
issue
that
have
be
identify
by
the
sector
as
be
area
of
most
press
concern
.
I
thank
the
co-operative
sector
,
particularly
the
umbrella
body
-
the
Irish
co-operative
Organisation
Society
,
the
National
Association
of
Building
Co-operative
and
the
National
Federation
of
Group
Water
Schemes
-
as
well

group
and
individual
contributor
for
they
very
positive
engagement
with
the
consultation
process
prior
to
the
draft
of
the
Bill
.
I
be
confident
that
the
co-operative
sector
will
warmly
welcome
the
reduction
in
the
administrative
burden
place
on
it
and
the
flexibility
offer
by
the
revise
arrangement
for
annual
return
.
I
believe
that
this
Bill
,
couple
with
the
very
significant
reduction
in
fee
charge
by
the
Registrar
of
friendly
Society
-
which
be
introduce
in
2012
,
the
UN
International
Year
of
Co-operative
-
will
assist
the
development
of
the
co-operative
model
as
a
distinct
form
of
organisation
,
as
commit
to
in
the
programme
for
government

I
do
not

that

it

remember
that

this
be
taxpayer
's
money
be
invest
effectively
through
Enterprise
Ireland
to
support
the
indigenous
sector
.
in
the
past
decade
the
influence
of
the
Internet
on
the
economy
have
be
grow
steadily
,
about
which
there
be
no
doubt
.
in
2013
Indecon
Consultants
estimate
that
digitalrelated
activity
contribute
4.4
%
of
gdp
to
the
economy
.
the
consultant
predict
that
this
contribution
would
increase
by
16
%
year
on
year
.
almost
95000
job
be
already
support
by
digital
-
related
activity
in
the
economy
.
notwithstanding
this
trend
,
CSO
datum
suggest
only
23
%
of
small
company
in
Ireland
be
engage
in
sale
through
e-commerce
.
the
proportion
be
consider
to
be
even
low
for
company
with
few
than
ten
employee
.
this
company
be
potentially
lose
valuable
sale
opportunity
in
both
the
Irish
market
and
in
sell
overseas
.
it
be
estimate
that
Irish
consumer
spend
just
under
€
6
billion
online
annually
,
of
which
60
%
to
70
%
go
overseas
.
encourage
more
indigenous
company
to
engage
in
e-commerce
be
,
therefore
,
a
key
objective
of
the
government
's
national
digital
strategy
and
a
action
plan
for
Jobs
.
the
2014
action
plan
include
a
commitment
to
roll
out
a
trading
online
voucher
scheme
to
2000
micro
and
small
business
by
the
end
of
2015
.
the
scheme
be
intend
as
a
catalyst
to
support
business
to
start
trade
online
or
improve
they
current
online
trading
offering
,
rather
than
simply
have
a
online
presence
and
there
be
a
qualitative
difference
.
it
provide
successful
applicant
with
a
voucher
up
to
the
value
of
€
2500
to
help
meet
this
objective
.
the
value
of
the
voucher
must
be
match
by
the
applicant
company
.
the
trading
online
voucher
scheme
fall
within
the
remit
of
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
.
however
,
the
voucher
will
be
administer
by
the
local
enterprise
office
.
follow
a
piloting
of
the
scheme
by
the
Dublin
City
Enterprise
Office
at
the
start
of
the
year
,
the
Minister
for
Communication
,
Energy
and
Natural
Resource
announce
the
national
roll
-
out
of
the
scheme
last
week
.
applicant
business
will
be
select
on
the
basis
of
they
project
plan
,
include
they
expect
growth
in
job
and
export
as
a
result
of
trade
online
.
there
be
strong
recognition
by
the
government
of
the
size
of
the
spend
and
its
impact
on
gdp
.
the
advent
of
the
online
trading
voucher
through
the
local
enterprise
office
,
LEOs
,
be
a
concrete
policy
intervention
in
recognise
this
trend
and
provide
funding
towards
support
business
.
on
the
eligibility
criterion
,
the
voucher
will
be
available
to
a
maximum
figure
of
€
2500
.
approval
must
be
obtain
prior
to
incur
any
expense
and
third
party
cost
only
will
be
consider
.
all
third
party
supplier
invoice
must
contain
proper
business
detail
.
this
be
a
robust
document
that
greatly
encourage
business
that
may
have
have
a
online
presence
but
which
be
not
trade
online
.
it
will
be
for
the
leo
to
advertise
locally
to
ensure
business
will
come
into
they
.
the
important
point
be
that
we
have
recognise
the
potential
value
and
create
a
solution
through
the
roll
-
out
of
the
trading
online
voucher
scheme
.
in
term
of
the
early
result
under
the
pilot
scheme
,
seven
out
of
ten
company
state
the
voucher
application
process
have
already
help
they
to
determine
how
online
trading
would
fit
into
they
business
.
some
70
%
of
the
company
involve
in
the
pilot
scheme
in
Dublin
have
receive
more
customer
inquiry
,
while
55
%
have
have
more
sale
.
there
be
a
provision
within
the
LEO
infrastructure
to
allow
that
company
that
wish
to
trade
online
do
so
and
we
be
already
see
a
positive
impact
.
it
be
impossible
to
give
the
exact
figure
for
how
much
the
State
will
spend
in
support
this
activity
,
but
there
be
a
provision
available
and
it
have
be
roll
out
across
the
State
in
the
piloting
of
the
scheme
.
the
demand
from
small
local
business
to
participate
have
be
extremely
high
.
it
will
take
we
a
little
time
to
have
datum
on
the
number
of
business
that
have
come
in
and
how
this
have
have
a
impact
on
they
business
.
be
the
deputy
speak
from
experience
there
?
during
the
Irish
Presidency
in
June
2013
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Bruton
,
secure
the
agreement
of
all
trade
minister
in
the
EU
Council
,
to
formally
open
negotiation
with
the
US
on
a
transatlantic
trade
and
investment
partnership
,
TTIP
.
at
a
time
of
high
unemployment
we
must
grasp
every
opportunity
that
add
to
the
momentum
of
recovery
that
government
policy
be
achieve
.
in
particular
,
huge
potential
be
offer
by
TTIP
to
accelerate
economic
growth
,
and
expand
trade
and
export
opportunity
.
this
give
we
the
potential
to
create
more
job
so
that
the
already
fall
unemployment
rate
can
be
more
quickly
reduce
.
Ireland
have
particularly
strong
economic
link
with
the
US
,
with
over
100000
people
employ
in
500
US
company
here
and
with
Irish
company
export
over
€
1
billion
in
goods
and
service
to
the
US
every
year
.
if
we
add
in
export
from
foreign
company
locate
here
,
over
€
26
billion
in
goods
and
service
be
sell
to
the
high
value
US
market
.
this
give
a
clear
indicator
of
the
opportunity
we
can
leverage
from
few
barrier
to
transatlantic
trade
.
the
Department
recently
engage
Copenhagen
Economics
to
examine
the
economic
and
other
impact
of
TTIP
and
relate
potential
opportunity
.
some
tentative
and
preliminary
finding
suggest
that
the
impact
on
we
economy
might
be
as
large
as
a
additional
1.1
%
increase
in
gdp
.
this
be
high
than
the
estimate
0.5
%
gdp
gain
from
TTIP
for
the
EU
as
a
whole
.
in
employment
term
,
this
could
lead
to
a
additional
8,000
job
for
Ireland
over
the
agreement
's
implementation
period
.
however
,
considerable
further
analysis
need
to
be
do
by
the
consultant
to
clarify
what
the
impact
of
TTIP
will
be
.
in
term
of
employment
,
benefit
be
likely
to
accrue
,
particularly
to
sector
such
as
life
science
,
ICT
,
food
and
manufacturing
.
this
include
a
large
number
of
sme
.
I
hope
this
would
gain
disproportionately
because
the
type
of
barrier
that
TTIP
aim
to
tackle
,
be
more
costly
for
small
company
to
deal
with
.
we
be
look
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
upside
and
be
not
view
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
downside
.
we
will
do
a
proper
analysis
,
but
it
be
be
undertake
with
a
view
to
a
economic
win
.
to
be
helpful
,
as
the
minister
deal
with
the
first
matter
have
not
arrive
,
I
suggest
we
take
the
second
matter
first
.
I
thank
deputy
Stanton
for
raise
this
matter
.
both
deputy
Stanton
and
I
be
play
as
a
tag
team
in
respect
of
this
issue
because
it
be
pertinent
to
we
constituency
.
the
area
refer
to
have
be
identify
by
my
department
as
one
of
the
area
where
due
to
demographic
change
it
be
project
that
there
will
be
a
requirement
for
significant
additional
school
provision
at
both
primary
and
post
-
primary
level
over
the
come
year
.
I
think
deputy
Stanton
first
identify
the
precipice
that
have
be
reach
in
respect
of
that
demographic
issue
in
the
first
instance
.
since
that
time
,
we
have
be
work
together
to
get
this
project
over
the
line
.
we
have
have
success
particularly
in
respect
of
Midleton
and
the
Gaelscoil
at
Mainistir
to
Corann
.

be
ongoing
at

.
I
have
already
refer
to
the
new
24
-
classroom
school
building
to
replace
a
exist
temporary
school
building
for
Gaelscoil
Mhainistir
to
Corann
.
this
be
go
through
the
rapid
planning
process
as
we
speak
.
the
deputy
have
also
refer
to
the
possible
need
for
another
primary
school
because
of
the
demographic
challenge
.
in
that
regard
,
a
new
16
-
classroom
primary
school
with
patronage
to
be
decide
will
be
build
and
a
new
1000

primary

be
due
to
be
establish
under
the
patronage
of
Cork
etb
involve
the
Catholic
Bishop
of
Cloyne
.
the
Department
,
with
the
assistance
of
Cork
County
Council
,
have
identify
and
be
currently
engage
in
the
site
acquisition
process
for
the
primary
and
post
-
primary
school
project
in
Carrigtwohill
refer
to
by
the
deputy
.
once
site
be
acquire
,
the
school
project
concerned
will
be
progress
immediately
through
the
architectural
planning
process
.
I
want
to
assure
the
people
of
this
area
and
deputy
Stanton
that
I
as
a
minister
of
State
in
that
Department
be
personally
oversee
that
project
.
the
deputy
and
I
have
discuss
the
commercial
sensitivity
around
specific
site
.
give
that
we
have
have
some
success
so
far
in
respect
of
Gaelscoil
Mhainistir
to
Corann
,
a
issue
that
go
on
into
its
second
decade
,
and
the
fact
that
the
planning
process
have
now
start
,
I
be
confident
we
will
continue
to
give
this
top
priority
in
respect
of
Carrigtwohill
.
I
can
assure
the
deputy
and
the
people
of
that
area
that
we
be
work
on
this
on
a
daily
basis
and
we
will
continue
to
work
,
if
I
dare
say
it
,
as
a
tag
team
on
the
government
side
of
this
House
to
deliver
this
necessary
project
.
I
understand
that
the
site
notice
be
up
for
Gaelscoil
Mhainistir
to
Corann
.
I
think
that
be
the
project
refer
to
by
deputy
Stanton
.
the
deputy
and
I
have
be
through
the
process
of
tease
out
the
site
acquisition
.
I
suppose
that
it
be
one
of
the
flaw
in
the
system
,
notwithstand
the
fact
that
there
be
a
memorandum
of
understanding
with
the
local
authority
,
when
one
be
seek
to
acquire
privately
own
land
and
there
be
a
market
value
on
the
land
.
there
be
a
inherent
challenge
there
because
of
the
constitutional
right
to
private
property
and
the
market
value
inherent
therein
.
on
top
of
that
,
if
there
be
a
number
of
site
that
have
be
designate
,
there
be
certain
commercial
sensitivity
around
that
.
I
be
confident
that
because
we
have
be
through
the
Gaelscoil
Midleton
process
together
,
the
same
energy
be
be
apply
to
the
challenge
in
Carrigtwohill
.
I
be
confident
that
once
the
site
be
acquire
,
we
can
move
rapidly
.
if
I
retain
my
position
or
indeed
regardless
of
my
position
,
I
will
continue
to
advocate
with
the
deputy
on
ensure
that
we
can
move
rapidly
to
get
this
school
build
.
I
cannot
give
the
deputy
a
definitive
timeframe
at
this
point
but
both
he
and
the
people
in
that
area
should
be
assure
of
we
commitment
to
ensure
that
we
deliver
within
the
five
-
year
planning
programme
.
that
be
the
aim
.
it
be
ominous
that
she
send
I
here
to
reply
.
I
be
take
this
matter
on
behalf
of
my
colleague
,
the
Tánaiste
and
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Burton
.
as
the
deputy
say
,
we
acknowledge
the
crucial
role
carer
play
in
society
.
in
2014
the
estimate
Department
expenditure
on
various
support
for
carer
will
be
almost
€
886
million
,
comprise
approximately
€557
million
on
the
carer
's
allowance
,
€
21.5
million
on
carer
's
benefit
,
€
122
million
on
the
respite
care
grant
and
€
105.1
million
on
domiciliary
care
allowance
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
highlight
one
of
this
key
support
for
carer
provide
by
the
Department
,
namely
,
the
respite
care
grant
.
the
grant
be
introduce
in
June
1999
,
at
which
time
the
Department
of
Health
also
pay
a
respite
care
grant
to
people
receive
domiciliary
care
allowance
who
be
not
in
receipt
of
carer
's
allowance
or
carer
's
benefit
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
.
the
domiciliary
care
allowance
scheme
transfer
to
the
Department
of
social
Protection
in
2009
as
do
responsibility
for
the
related
respite
care
grant
.
in
2005
the
stand
-
alone
respite
care
grant
be
introduce
for
all
full
-
time
carer
.
all
respite
care
grant
be
now
administer
by
the
Department
.
although
the
grant
be
not
subject
to
a
means
test
,
applicant
be
not
eligible
for
the
grant
if
they
be
work
more
than
15
hour
per
week
outside
the
home
,
if
they
be
get
a
jobseeker
's
payment
or
if
they
be
sign
on
for
credit
.
there
be
no
obligation
on
carer
to
use
the
respite
care
grant
to
access
respite
service
.
the
value
of
the
grant
stand
at
€
1,375
and
this
year
it
be
estimate
that
the
grant
will
be
pay
to
some
87000
person
at
a
cost
of
€
122
million
.
a
person
care
for
more
than
one
person
receive
a
grant
for
each
person
for
whom
they
care
.
the
grant
be
pay
on
the
first
Thursday
in
June
of
the
relevant
year
to
cover
52
week
from
this
date
.
as
it
be
a
advance
payment
,
the
type
of
circumstance
to
which
the
deputy
refer
be
already
cover
.
the
grant
be
not
pay
on
a
proportional
basis
and
in
order
to
qualify
a
person
must
,
in
addition
to
other
criterion
,
be
caring
for
at
least
six
month
.
the
mid-year
June
payment
date
allow
carer
to
avail
of
respite
over
the
summer
month
,
facilitate
the
administration
of
the
grant
and
ensure
that
the
grant
be
target
at
that
provide
full
-
time
care
over
a
significant
period
of
time
.
in
a
review
of
the
grant
undertake
by
the
Department
in
recent
year
,
carer
be
ask
about
they
preference
regard
payment
.
the
option
of
split
the
grant
into
two
or
three
payment
through
the
year
be
put
to
people
and
the
vast
majority
of
respondent
,
84
%
,
indicate
that
they
would
prefer
no
change
to
the
current
arrangement
.
this
view
be
prevalent
irrespective
of
age
group
,
social
welfare
status
,
gender
,
location
,
number
of
care
recipient
or
marital
status
.
in
favour
the
current
annual
payment
,
people
express
the
view
that
a
large
lump
sum
would
be
more
likely
to
be
use
for
a
specific
purpose
,
such
as
a
holiday
,
whereas
small
sum
pay
more
frequently
would
be
more
likely
to
be
absorb
in
the
day
-
to
-
day
expense
of
the
household
.
in
general
,
respondent
state
that
they
be
very
pleased
to
receive
the
grant
and
that
it
be
very
helpful
to
they
in
ease
the
financial
stress
they
have
be
experience
.
that
who
use
the
grant
for
a
holiday
generally
feel
that
the
break
would
not
have
be
possible
without
the
grant
.
person
who
use
the
grant
for
other
purpose
,
particularly
to
pay
regular
household
bill
,
consider
that
the
grant
eas
they
financial
worry
generally
.
there
be
a
recognition
of
the
work
carer
do
,
which
be
part
of
the
Irish
psyche
and
the
intergenerational
solidarity
that
exist
here
.
I
do
not
know
if
the
government
will
increase
the
payment
because
we
be
not
in
a
position
,
regard
the
budget
arithmetic
,
to
ascertain
whether
there
be
scope
to
do
so
.

Ireland
be
work
directly
in
Sierra
Leone
and
Liberia
and
internationally
on
a
comprehensive
and
effective
response
to
the
ebola
epidemic
in
west
Africa
.
we
must
see
it
in
the
context
of
where
Ireland
sit
.
Ireland
be
very
much
part
of
the
international
response
which
sit
within
the
UN
infrastructure
where
there
be
a
special
UN
envoy
,
Mr.
Anthony
Banbury
,
who
be
on
the
ground
in
the
three
country
,
Sierra
Leone
,
Liberia
and
Guinea
in
particular
.
I
do
not
participate
in
the
donor
conference
in
London
last
week
because
I
be
in
Sierra
Leone
.
the
President
of
Sierra
Leone
be
unable
to
attend
the
conference
and
we
meet
he
in
Sierra
Leone
.
the
issue
here
be
not
the
monetary
response
per
se
.
I
be
confident
that
,
through
the
UN
infrastructure
,
the
political
willingness
exist
give
the
mandate
the
United
Nation
have
to
deal
with
this
.
from
a
European
Union
perspective
,
I
tend
to
agree
with
the
deputy
's
point
in
that
there
need
to
be
a
more
robust
political
response
at
a
EU
level
to
ensure
that
,
with
the
€
180
million
which
be
commit
by
the
EU
,
there
be
a
political
pressure
or
diplomatic
effort
apply
in
that
country
as
well
as
a
medical
and
humanitarian
response
to
ensure
that
system
-----
I
request
a
little
latitude
,
if
I
may
-
just
30
second
.
if
deputy
Smith
be
talk
about
medical
evacuation
,
there
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
clarity
such
that
when
Irish
people
go
out
there
to
help
in
the
effort
,
there
be
some
degree
of
assurance
that
they
can
have
a
pathway
back
to
the
most
appropriate
treatment
centre
.
the
national
response
on
this
be
discuss
at
cabinet
this
morning
.
this
will
take
a
interdepartmental
group
because
we
need
to
ensure
if
there
be
person
come
back
from
west
Africa
who
display
symptom
that
there
be
a
clear
pathway
from
they
house
or
place
of
work
directly
to
a
fully
staff
and
equip
hospital
-
wherever
that
may
be
within
the
country
-
and
that
there
be
a
clear
protocol
.
that
be
something
that
be
be
discuss
.
it
be
a
live
issue
as
we
speak
.
if
Sierra
Leonean
health
care
worker
be
not
work
on
the
ground
,
for
instance
,
because
they
may
not
have
be
pay
for
a
number
of
month
,
and
if
they
do
not
have
confidence
in
they
own
system
on
the
ground
,
and
I
can
only
speak
for
Sierra
Leone
,
it
be
difficult
to
ask
a
Irish
front
-
line
health
care
worker
to
work
in
that
circumstance
.
that
be
where
the
UN
co-ordinator
,
Mr.
Banbury
,
be
work
.
he
be
work
with
we
ambassador
and
Irish
ngo
,
such
as
GOAL
,
concern
and
Plan
Ireland
so
that
there
be
a
cross-sectoral
approach
to
deal
with
this
.
I
be
not
say
one
take
it
out
of
Sierra
Leonean
hand
,
but
one
manage
and
internationalise
the
effort
.
it
be
only
in
the
past
72
hour
that
we
be
see
a
major
ramping
up
of
that
effort
.
I
assure
the
deputy
that
this
be
be
discuss
in
term
of
a
Irish
response
on
the
ground
if
somebody
should
contract
the
virus
when
on
Irish
soil
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
this
debate
about
beef
price
.
beef
farmer
be
face
a
crisis
because
of
the
price
they
be
get
for
they
cattle
and
they
stock
.
I
agree
with
what
Deputy
McNamara
and
Martin
Ferris
have
to
say
about
the
issue
in
the
beef
sector
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
beef
market
in
this
State
be
control
by
a
small
number
of
processor
who
manipulate
and
control
the
price
that
farmer
can
achieve
for
they
stock
when
they
take
it
to
the
mart
.
that
be
the
crux
of
the
problem
for
the
beef
sector
in
this
country
.
the
average
income
of
beef
farmer
be
between
€
12,000
and
€
13000
per
annum
.
it
be
not
viable
for
they
.
they
be
struggle
.
farmer
along
the
west
coast
,
particularly
in
County
Donegal
,
be
depend
on
this
sector
.
there
be
just
three
operator
in
the
processing
sector
.
this
be
what
they
do
.
they
natural
tendency
be
to
maximise
they
profit
.
they
do
this
by
manipulate
price
.
that
be
what
they
set
out
to
do
and
that
be
what
they
do
.
the
problem
,
unfortunately
,
be
that
this
activity
be
not
police
in
this
State
.
I
recognise
that
live
export
have
increase
.
I
look
at
the
Bord
Bia
figure
today
.
the
minister
mention
that
there
have
be
increase
of
15
%
,
but
I
suggest
we
should
set
a
target
of
achieve
a
increase
of
30
%
or
50
%
.
that
would
provide
the
competition
in
the
mart
that
we
be
all
talk
about
.
if
the
processor
have
to
compete
,
they
will
end
up
pay
a
living
,
reasonable
price
for
the
stock
they
buy
from
farmer
.
over
the
past
15
or
20
year
,
hundred
of
small
abattoir
have
to
close
after
increase
regulation
and
standard
be
force
on
they
.
when
they
be
force
out
of
the
market
,
it
take
many
people
who
would
have
be
buy
cattle
at
mart
out
of
the
mart
and
out
of
the
cattle
-
purchase
sector
.
that
be
one
example
of
how
the
processor
have
manage
to
get
rid
of
competition
.
competition
be
further
diminish
when
live
export
be
reduce
.
the
processor
have
all
the
control
.
while
I
accept
the
minister
set
up
the
beef
forum
,
I
suggest
it
merely
involve
politely
ask
the
processor
to
do
something
to
improve
the
way
they
deal
with
farmer
and
to
increase
they
price
.
it
have
no
tooth
.
the
minister
must
have
some
tooth
if
he
be
to
enforce
the
requirement
on
the
processor
to
act
reasonably
and
responsibly
.
I
do
not
believe
the
multiple
play
a
huge
part
in
Ireland
in
term
of
the
price
that
farmer
can
get
.
we
export
90
%
of
what
we
produce
through
the
factory
.
if
the
multiple
here
be
pay
good
price
,
it
would
not
trickle
down
because
it
would
involve
no
more
than
10
%
of
the
stock
that
go
through
processor
.
the
big
problem
be
the
control
the
factory
exert
on
the
market
in
this
country
.
we
need
to
think
about
to
where
this
lead
back
.
I
read
a
article
today
trace
the
genesis
of
the
crisis
in
the
beef
sector
back
to
last
year
's
horsemeat
scandal
.
the
rationale
for
the
article
be
that
the
supermarket
and
multiple
in
England
start
to
put
pressure
on
processor
to
ensure
they
stick
rigidly
to
certain
specification
.
the
processor
then
use
that
specification
to
push
down
the
price
at
the
mart
.
what
have
happen
in
the
Department
in
the
period
since
the
horsemeat
crisis
threaten
we
beef
sector
?
have
there
be
any
follow
-
up
on
the
horsemeat
crisis
?
be
there
any
prosecution
outstanding
?
be
anything
happen
that
will
force
the
processor
to
act
responsibly
in
the
future
?
that
be
the
kind
of
pressure
we
need
to
put
on
they
if
we
be
to
ensure
they
behave
responsibly
.
we
should
ask
the
Competition
Authority
to
examine
the
operation
of
this
country
's
beef
sector
,
with
a
particular
focus
on
processing
.
if
we
be
to
address
this
issue
,
we
must
look
seriously
at
the
competition
aspect
of
it
.

I
go
through
the
Competition
Authority
's
website
,
I
could
not
find
any
reference
to
the
investigation
of
the
beef
sector
.
I
do
not
see
any
evidence
of
a
outcome
of
a
investigation
contain
a
finding
that
the
sector
be
competitive
.
the
minister
should
be
ask
the
Competition
Authority
to
assess
the
level
of
competition
in
the
beef
sector
.
he
also
need
to
increase
live
export
and
ensure
processor
have
to
pay
reasonable
price
for
they
produce
.
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
this
debate
about
beef
price
.
beef
farmer
be
face
a
crisis
because
of
the
price
they
be
get
for
they
cattle
and
they
stock
.
I
agree
with
what
Deputy
McNamara
and
Martin
Ferris
have
to
say
about
the
issue
in
the
beef
sector
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
beef
market
in
this
State
be
control
by
a
small
number
of
processor
who
manipulate
and
control
the
price
that
farmer
can
achieve
for
they
stock
when
they
take
it
to
the
mart
.
that
be
the
crux
of
the
problem
for
the
beef
sector
in
this
country
.
the
average
income
of
beef
farmer
be
between
€
12,000
and
€
13000
per
annum
.
it
be
not
viable
for
they
.
they
be
struggle
.
farmer
along
the
west
coast
,
particularly
in
County
Donegal
,
be
depend
on
this
sector
.
there
be
just
three
operator
in
the
processing
sector
.
this
be
what
they
do
.
they
natural
tendency
be
to
maximise
they
profit
.
they
do
this
by
manipulate
price
.
that
be
what
they
set
out
to
do
and
that
be
what
they
do
.
the
problem
,
unfortunately
,
be
that
this
activity
be
not
police
in
this
State
.
I
recognise
that
live
export
have
increase
.
I
look
at
the
Bord
Bia
figure
today
.
the
minister
mention
that
there
have
be
increase
of
15
%
,
but
I
suggest
we
should
set
a
target
of
achieve
a
increase
of
30
%
or
50
%
.
that
would
provide
the
competition
in
the
mart
that
we
be
all
talk
about
.
if
the
processor
have
to
compete
,
they
will
end
up
pay
a
living
,
reasonable
price
for
the
stock
they
buy
from
farmer
.
over
the
past
15
or
20
year
,
hundred
of
small
abattoir
have
to
close
after
increase
regulation
and
standard
be
force
on
they
.
when
they
be
force
out
of
the
market
,
it
take
many
people
who
would
have
be
buy
cattle
at
mart
out
of
the
mart
and
out
of
the
cattle
-
purchase
sector
.
that
be
one
example
of
how
the
processor
have
manage
to
get
rid
of
competition
.
competition
be
further
diminish
when
live
export
be
reduce
.
the
processor
have
all
the
control
.
while
I
accept
the
minister
set
up
the
beef
forum
,
I
suggest
it
merely
involve
politely
ask
the
processor
to
do
something
to
improve
the
way
they
deal
with
farmer
and
to
increase
they
price
.
it
have
no
tooth
.
the
minister
must
have
some
tooth
if
he
be
to
enforce
the
requirement
on
the
processor
to
act
reasonably
and
responsibly
.
I
do
not
believe
the
multiple
play
a
huge
part
in
Ireland
in
term
of
the
price
that
farmer
can
get
.
we
export
90
%
of
what
we
produce
through
the
factory
.
if
the
multiple
here
be
pay
good
price
,
it
would
not
trickle
down
because
it
would
involve
no
more
than
10
%
of
the
stock
that
go
through
processor
.
the
big
problem
be
the
control
the
factory
exert
on
the
market
in
this
country
.
we
need
to
think
about
to
where
this
lead
back
.
I
read
a
article
today
trace
the
genesis
of
the
crisis
in
the
beef
sector
back
to
last
year
's
horsemeat
scandal
.
the
rationale
for
the
article
be
that
the
supermarket
and
multiple
in
England
start
to
put
pressure
on
processor
to
ensure
they
stick
rigidly
to
certain
specification
.
the
processor
then
use
that
specification
to
push
down
the
price
at
the
mart
.
what
have
happen
in
the
Department
in
the
period
since
the
horsemeat
crisis
threaten
we
beef
sector
?
have
there
be
any
follow
-
up
on
the
horsemeat
crisis
?
be
there
any
prosecution
outstanding
?
be
anything
happen
that
will
force
the
processor
to
act
responsibly
in
the
future
?
that
be
the
kind
of
pressure
we
need
to
put
on
they
if
we
be
to
ensure
they
behave
responsibly
.
we
should
ask
the
Competition
Authority
to
examine
the
operation
of
this
country
's
beef
sector
,
with
a
particular
focus
on
processing
.
if
we
be
to
address
this
issue
,
we
must
look
seriously
at
the
competition
aspect
of
it
.
I
see
a
quote
from
the
minister
today
to
the
effect
that
the
Competition
Authority
have
suggest
that
the
beef
sector
be
very
competitive
.
when
I
go
through
the
Competition
Authority
's
website
,
I
could
not
find
any
reference
to
the
investigation
of
the
beef
sector
.
I
do
not
see
any
evidence
of
a
outcome
of
a
investigation
contain
a
finding
that
the
sector
be
competitive
.
the
minister
should
be
ask
the
Competition
Authority
to
assess
the
level
of
competition
in
the
beef
sector
.
he
also
need
to
increase
live
export
and
ensure
processor
have
to
pay
reasonable
price
for
they
produce
.
that
would
mean
a
effective
tax
rate
of
59
%
.
I
move
:
that
it
be
expedient
to
amend
the
law
relate
to
custom
and
inland
revenue
(
include
excise
)
and
to
make
further
provision
in
connection
with
finance
.
I
reiterate
what
the
minister
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
,
say
in
respect
of
we
ability
to
maintain
we
commitment
in
respect
of
ODA
,
namely
,
official
development
assistance
or
overseas
development
aid
,
as
it
be
sometimes
know
.
in
the
context
of
the
partner
organisation
with
which
we
work
and
which
operate
under
the
auspices
of
Irish
Aid
,
the
cumulative
figure
provide
show
that
we
have
be
able
to
marginally
increase
the
level
of
we
financial
commitment
.
this
be
the
first
occasion
in
quite
a
number
of
year
that
we
have
be
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
we
have
be
able
to
maintain
this
commitment
because
of
the
work
do
by
we
partner
organisation
,
of
which
there
be
many
.
there
be
no
good
example
in
this
regard
than
the
current
crisis
involve
Ebola
.
work
on
the
ground
and
under
the
auspices
of
Irish
Aid
,
partner
organisation
such
as
concern
and
Goal
be
have
a
major
impact
in
term
of
deliver
humanitarian
assistance
and
help
to
build
capacity
in
the
affect
region
.
this
organisation
have
the
flexibility
to
react
to
this
crisis
and
to
become
major
stakeholder
in
the
fight
against
Ebola
in
the
country
most
affect
,
such
as
Sierra
Leone
.
the
Ebola
crisis
be
have
a
impact
across
transnational
boundary
.
however
,
the
partner
organisation
-
as
a
result
of
funding
which
be
smartly
divest
to
they
through
Irish
Aid
-
be
also
make
a
impression
in
what
one
might
term
"
a
live
setting
"
.
it
be
important
that
we
have
be
able
to
maintain
we
financial
commitment
in
this
area
and
I
be
grateful
to
the
government
for
facilitate
we
in
do
so
.
as
a
island
nation
on
the
western
periphery
of
Europe
which
do
not
have
any
military
standing
,
it
be
important
-
in
term
of
what
we
do
abroad
-
that
part
of
we
foreign
policy
relate
to
target
funding
towards
nutrition
,
hunger
and
poverty
alleviation
.
the
funding
provide
will
allow
we
to
continue
the
work
to
which
I
refer
and
to
deepen
we
engagement
,
particularly
with
partner
country
-
such
as
Sierra
Leone
-
with
which
we
have
bilateral
relationship
and
in
which
we
have
ambassadorial
mission
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
pay
tribute
to
the
work
be
do
by
Ireland
,
through
its
mission
and
ambassador
,
in
Sierra
Leone
in
the
context
of
influence
-
in
conjunction
with
international
organisation
such
as
the
UN
mission
-
the
government
there
to
pursue
a
policy
of
contain
the
crisis
.
that
be
only
one
articulation
or
example
of
the
impact
we
partner
organisation
,
such
as
Goal
and
concern
,
be
have
there
.
it
be
important
to
recognise
the
work
they
do
and
keep
faith
with
this
commitment
,
and
I
be
pleased
to
say
that
we
have
do
so
.
we
have
demonstrate
we
commitment
in
the
budget
by
ensure
there
will
be
no
reduction
in
Ireland
's
overall
official
development
assistance
for
2015
.
we
have
allocate
€600
million
for
ODA
.
while
there
be
a
slight
reduction
in
vote
27
,
as
the
Minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
have
say
,
there
will
be
no
reduction
in
Ireland
's
overall
oda
commitment
for
2015
.
we
will
increase
it
slightly
,
depend
on
the
eventual
outturn
for
2014
.
anyway
,
we
anticipate
there
will
be
a
slight
increase
.
we
have
be
recognise
internationally
for
successfully
stabilise
we
development
budget
in
the
past
three
year
after
severe
cut
and
in
the
face
of
serious
economic
difficulty
.
maintain
the
budget
by
provide
€
601
million
for
Ireland
's
aid
programme
will
be
see
as
a
significant
Irish
contribution
in
2015
.
next
year
will
be
the
international
year
of
development
and
I
expect
Ireland
will
continue
to
play
a
lead
role
at
the
Unite
Nation
in
negotiate
a
new
set
of
global
development
goal
to
follow
from
the
millennium
development
goal
.
it
contain
no
reference
to
old
people
,
which
be
amazing
when
one
consider
we
increase
age
demographic
.
disability
funding
be
not
cut
last
year
,
but
Sinn
Féin
claim
that
in
its
document
.
there
be
no
reference
to
the
€
12

allocate
for
disability

for

leaver
or
the
€
6
million
for

service
for

up
to

year
of
age
.
neither
do
it
mention
any
allocation
for
the
roll
out
of
primary

.
Sinn

call
for
the
extension
of
the
BreastCheck

,
which
I
be
glad
to
say
be

.
it
want
funding
for

to
be

however
,
it

for
whom

it
must
be
remember
,

out
of
the

budget
.
suicide

strictly
about
the
message
in
different
area
of

,
and
we
be

a
new
framework
.
budget
2015
provide
for
a
additional
€
35
million
to
be
ring
-
fence
for
mental
health
service
.
this
will
bring
to
€
125
million
the
total
investment
by
the
government
in
mental
health
service
since
2012
.
the
additional
funding
will
enable
the
Health
Service
executive
,
HSE
,
to
continue
to
develop
and
modernise
we
mental
health
service
in
line
with
a
Vision
for
Change
.
the
additional
funding
will
be
direct
towards
the
continue

and
also

,
which
need
to
be

up

this
will
be
deliver
through
further
recruitment
and
investment
in
agency
and
service
to
achieve
a
consistent
service
provision
across
all
area
.
it
should
not
matter
whether
one
be
in
Dingle
or
Donegal
.
the
pathway
to
and
the
delivery
of
the
service
should
be
the
same
.
in
addition
,
the
funding
will
also
permit
urgent

,
include
psychiatric
intensive

.
I
be
sure
deputy
Dessie
Ellis
do
not
disagree
with
any
of
this
provision
.
additional

in
2015
will
provide
for
prioritisation
of

in

to

there

with

much

I
believe
we
will
find
a
way
to
either
slow

we
have
a
difficulty
with

,
this

we
have
set
aside

to
address
this
problem
in

I
always

that
just
prove
it
be
always

,
to
which
the
first

say
,
''

I
just
butter
the

''
it
be
the
same
when
it
come
to
the
Opposition
-
no
government
will
ever
do
it
right
in
its
eye
.
I
believe
we
be
do
a
very
good
job
in
the
difficult
circumstance
in
which
we
find
ourselves
.
I
be
very
grateful
that
we
have
extraordinarily
talented
people
in
the
Civil
Service
and
public
service
to
help
we
do
that
job
.
I
thank
deputy
Smith
for
raise
this
issue
and
I
thank
he
for
he
kind
word
.
it
be
appropriate
to
have
this
discussion
on
Ebola
today
,
give
the
rapid
deterioration
in
the
situation
in
west
Africa
over
the
past
month
and
with
case
appear
elsewhere
in
the
world
.
this
debate
be
particularly
timely
,
give
that
the
Ebola
crisis
be
discuss
at
the
EU
foreign
affair
Council
meeting
yesterday
and
will
be
discuss
at
the
European
Council
late
this
week
.
the
late
World
Health
Organisation
figure
be
alarming
-
well
over
9000
people
infect
by
Ebola
,
and
over
4500
death
in
west
Africa
.
despite
all
the
effort
of
the
international
community
,
the
likelihood
be
that
the
situation
will
deteriorate
further
before
it
improve
.
I
meet
Mr.
Banbury
when
I
be
in
Freetown
in
Sierra
Leone
.
he
indicate
to
we
that
the
crisis
would
get
bad
before
it
get
good
.
Ireland
have
be
very
actively
engage
at
all
level
in
address
the
crisis
on
the
ground
and
internationally
.
as
the
deputy
be
aware
,
I
travel
to
Sierra
Leone
at
the
start
of
the
month
and
witness
at
first
hand
the
devastating
impact
of
Ebola
there
.
I
come
away
from
my
visit
with
three
strong
impression
.
there
be
a
key
gap
in
leadership
and
co-ordination
,
which
I
be
glad
to
say
be
now
be
fill
by
the
UN
emergency
Ebola
mission
,
UNMEER
,
head
by
Mr.
Nabarro
and
co-ordinate
by
Mr.
Banbury
.
there
remain
important
funding
need
and
this
have
be
recognise
in
yesterday
's
motion
at
the
foreign
affair
Council
.
there
be
a
need
to
scale
up
capacity
for
isolation
and
treatment
.
there
be
a
urgent
need
for
more
international
health
care
professional
to
staff
the
isolation
and
treatment
centre
.
Ireland
be
one
of
a
very
small
number
of
EU
member
state
with
a
embassy
in
Freetown
.
I
be
strike
during
my
visit
by
the
very
strong
advocacy
and
co-ordination
role
be
play
by
the
Irish
ambassador
-
designate
,
Ms
Walsh
,
and
she
small
and
dedicated
team
.
Ireland
be
work
closely
with
international
partner
and
other
,
include
the
US
and
the
UK
and
the
government
of
Sierra
Leone
,
in
the
fight
against
Ebola
.
the
question
of
co-ordination
be
a
key
issue
if
the
Ebola
virus
be
to
be
tackle
effectively
in
the
west
Africa
region
and
if
its
spread
to
other
country
be
to
be
prevent
.
this
be
discuss
at
the
foreign
affair
Council
in
Luxembourg
yesterday
which
be
attend
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
.
the
Council
's
decision
yesterday
represent
a
important
further
step
in
EU
effort
to
tackle
the
crisis
by
reaffirm
the
need
to
work
together
in
a
co-ordinate
way
and
to
pool
we
strength
.
I
wish
to
assure
the
deputy
that
as
a
result
of
visit
Sierra
Leone
it
be
my
view
that
Ireland
must
use
its
influence
at
the
Unite
Nation
and
through
the
European
Council
to
support
the
need
for
a
pan-European
or
strong
EU
response
to
this
crisis
.
the
bilateral
response
be
a
powerful
one
but
it
be
not
sufficient
to
tackle
the
nature
of
this
crisis
.
there
be
a
clear
need
for
health
worker
and
other
key
personnel
to
be
represent
on
the
ground
.
the
Council
meeting
yesterday
recognise
the
need
to
support
international
health
responder
.
it
agree
that
the
EU
will
provide
appropriate
care
for
they
,
include
the
possibility
of
medical
evacuation
if
necessary
.
we
must
now
work
urgently
to
ensure
it
be
implement
in
full
.
I
can
only
speak
for
Sierra
Leone
.
I
concur
absolutely
with
the
deputy
on
he
remark
on
the
effort
of
the
ngo
.
the
work
do
by
GOAL
,
concern
,
Plan
and
other
agency
be
extremely
effective
.
the
Irish
government
's
response
be
that
we
need
to
be
flexible
in
we
approach
and
Irish
Aid
,
which
be
very
close
to
the
NGO
community
,
be
be
allow
to
pivot
towards
the
Ebola
response
.
the
big
concern
I
have
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
official
development
assistance
be
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
we
need
to
ensure
we
do
not
spark
a
humanitarian
crisis
in
all
of
this
.
the
nutrition
programme
be
deliver
need
to
continue
apace
.
instinctively
,
I
think
the
deputy
be
right
about
the
underreporting
.
it
be
only
a
matter
of
week
since
I
be
there
,
and
it
be
at
that
juncture
the
UN
have
come
to
Sierra
Leone
in
particular
.
now
that
Mr.
Banbury
have
be
appoint
as
co-ordinator
,
we
ambassador
be
work
very
closely
on
liais
with
the
Sierra
Leone
government
to
ensure
we
assist
in
build
the
infrastructure
to
treat
people
medically
on
the
ground
,
and
this
response
be
happen
.
it
be
a
fair
assumption
that
where
there
be
no
international
involvement
until
relatively
recently
,
and
instead
reliance
on
the
Sierra
Leone
department
of
health
,
social
welfare
or
education
to
deliver
programme
with
the
ngo
,
there
be
a
certain
lack
of
capacity
and
the
ngo
be
punch
above
they
weight
.
now
we
have
international
co-ordination
and
various
government
have
respond
proactively
.
I
agree
absolutely
the
European
response
need
to
be
rapid
.
the
resolution
yesterday
,
arise
from
the
Luxembourg
meeting
,
be
significant
because
it
recognise
for
the
first
time
the
need
to
ensure
we
protect
health
worker
who
go
out
there
.
a
live
issue
we
be
deal
with
when
I
be
there
be
the
need
to
ensure
local
Sierra
Leonean
health
worker
be
pay
,
because
they
have
not
be
pay
for
quite
a
period
of
time
.
it
be
difficult
to
expect
a
Irish
or
Spanish
health
worker
to
go
there
if
the
Sierra
Leonean
health
worker
be
not
be
pay
and
be
stay
away
.
there
be
a
strike
at
one
stage
.
this
be
the
issue
we
be
deal
with
.
we
be
very
effective
and
make
solid
progress
on
this
issue
.
I
agree
the
international
response
need
to
be
more
proactive
,
but
for
we
part
as
member
of
the
European
Union
we
have
have
a
influence
in
bring
this
to
bear
,
in
term
of
we
intervention
through
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
,
at
the
foreign
affair
Council
yesterday
.
we
be
keep
a
daily
watch
on
this
because
we
want
to
ensure
where
possible
case
be
deal
with
medically
within
the
region
.
this
be
the
most
effective
way
of
deal
with
case
.
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
might
have
write
a
different
pre-budget
statement
about
the
capacity
of
people
to
bear
even
more
austerity
because
of
the
crisis
memory
,
as
refer
to
by
deputy
Paul
Murphy
,
have
it
be
write
follow
the
demonstration
last
Saturday
week
.
it
get
that
very
wrong
.
what
the
demonstration
show
be
that
people
have
have
enough
and
they
be
not
willing
to
take
any
more
.
I
apologise
to
the
minister
for
not
be
present
for
he
speech
.
the
reason
I
be
late
be
because
I
be
attend
a
meeting
to
organise
the
next
big
demonstration
which
will
take
place
on
1
November
.
he
will
see
that
last
Saturday
week
be
not
a
one
-
off
event
but
be
part
of
a
grow
and
sustained
revolt
throughout
the
country
with
people
say
they
have
have
it
and
they
be
draw
a
line
with
water
charge
or
any
attempt
to
make
they
pay
any
more
for
the
crime
of
other
such
as
banker
and
bondholder
.
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
have
get
it
very
wrong
on
that
front
.
I
have
no
problem
with
the
concept
of
independent
monitoring
or
overview
of
government
economic
policy
in
term
of
ensure
policy
be
not
pursue
which
would
create
instability
or
crisis
.
I
would
equally
say
democratically
elect
government
and
,
more
important
,
the
people
who
elect
they
must
ultimately
have
the
freedom
to
make
they
own
decision
.
I
do
not
have
a
problem
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
say
he
do
not
agree
with
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
and
the
government
will
do
thing
in
its
own
way
because
,
ultimately
,
such
decision
must
be
make
by
the
people
.
the
problem
I
have
be
that
this
so
-
call
independent
group
have
be
set
up
by
the
troika
and
its
main
task
have
be
to
ensure
ordinary
people
pay
the
price
for
a
banking
and
financial
crisis
that
be
not
create
by
they
but
be
create
by
the
financial
institution
,
the
big
political
institution
in
Europe
and
the
political
establishment
in
this
country
.
its
main
job
have
be
to
ensure
ordinary
people
pay
the
price
for
that
.
that
have
be
a
terrible
price
.
the
choice
we
be
offer
be
between
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
say
we
have
to
continue
down
this
road
and
take
a
further
€
2
billion
out
of
the
economy
,
thus
inflict
even
more
suffering
on
ordinary
people
,
or
the
government
's
claim
that
we
do
not
have
to
do
it
because
its
policy
be
such
a
fantastic
success
that
it
be
not
necessary
to
do
so
,
that
we
be
out
of
the
wood
now
due
to
its
policy
which
chart
the
way
forward
,
and
that
perhaps
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
do
not
fully
understand
just
how
fantastically
successful
the
government
's
policy
have
be
,
which
be
the
reason
it
be
not
necessary
to
make
a
further
cut
of
€
2
billion
.
both
of
that
option
be
false
,
but
there
be
aspect
of
truth
in
both
.
I
agree
with
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
's
statement
that
the
downside
risk
in
term
of
the
European
economy
be
such
that
we
must
be
careful
about
the
rather
spectacular
growth
projection
that
be
emerge
.
the
IFAC
have
a
good
point
to
make
about
there
be
a
serious
danger
involve
in
that
regard
.
I
worry
a
lot
about
the
government
's
current
triumphalism
in
term
of
the
project
growth
it
state
will
alleviate
the
debt
burden
,
solve
the
deficit
problem
,
and
chart
we
on
the
way
back
to
economic
recovery
and
out
of
a
boom
and
slump
cycle
.
I
do
not
see
that
at
all
.
there
be
a
problem
with
both
the
way
the
government
and
the
fiscal
Advisory
Council
look
at
the
situation
in
that
they
have
not
identify
what
it
be
that
produce
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
in
the
first
place
.
the
analysis
of
both
party
have
fail
to
address
that
fundamental
question
.
as
deputy
Paul
Murphy
indicate
,
there
be
a
significant
element
of
try
to
rewrite
what
happen
.
the
government
's
narrative
,
which
it
share
with
IFAC
,
be
that
the
problem
be
we
be
spend
way
beyond
we
means
and
therefore
it
be
all
about
rein
in
public
spending
to
avoid
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
be
not
what
cause
the
crisis
.
I
be
amazed
the
minister
do
not
understand
that
and
I
be
shocked
beyond
belief
that
IFAC
,
as
a
body
of
economic
expert
,
do
not
understand
it
.
of
course
one
need
a
balance
budget
and
a
link
between
expenditure
and
revenue
,
but
the
claim
that
such
be
the
problem
be
simply
not
true
.
we
debt
be
manageable
until
the
crash
come
.
we
expenditure
be
not
vastly
outstrip
revenue
but
what
be
a
problem
be
the
type
of
growth
we
have
.
at
various
time
the
minister
acknowledge
the
point
,
although
even
when
he
be
in
opposition
he
do
not
do
much
about
it
.
very
few
people
-
really
only
the
left
-
call
for
a
stop
to
what
be
happen
and
say
the
focus
and
disproportionate
emphasis
on
the
property
sector
be
dangerous
and
be
a
accident
wait
to
happen
that
could
result
in
a
economic
crash
.
that
be
the
problem
that
lead
to
the
crash
,
which
be
facilitate
by
banker
,
rather
than
we
spend
more
than
we
be
get
in
revenue
.
I
be
worried
about
precisely
the
same
thing
now
.
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
real
analysis
either
from
the
government
or
IFAC
about
the
type
of
growth
that
be
necessary
if
we
want
to
get
out
of
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
.
could
the
minister
clarify
whether
we
plan
for
economic
growth
be
base
on
sustainable
model
where
one
take
into
account
what
we
produce
,
for
whom
,
and
whether
it
be
about
meet
the
need
of
people
and
society
or
if
it
be
just
about
growth
number
and
balance
sheet
?
that
be
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
approach
of
both
the
minister
and
IFAC
.
we
need
a
different
model
that
start
with
what
society
need
,
what
people
need
and
plan
to
meet
that
need
rather
than
the
market
model
which
be
just
about
rampant
,
naked
competition
which
be
what
produce
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
the
minister
say
he
want
to
get
away
from
.
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
might
have
write
a
different
pre-budget
statement
about
the
capacity
of
people
to
bear
even
more
austerity
because
of
the
crisis
memory
,
as
refer
to
by
deputy
Paul
Murphy
,
have
it
be
write
follow
the
demonstration
last
Saturday
week
.
it
get
that
very
wrong
.
what
the
demonstration
show
be
that
people
have
have
enough
and
they
be
not
willing
to
take
any
more
.
I
apologise
to
the
minister
for
not
be
present
for
he
speech
.
the
reason
I
be
late
be
because
I
be
attend
a
meeting
to
organise
the
next
big
demonstration
which
will
take
place
on
1
November
.
he
will
see
that
last
Saturday

be
not
a

but
be

of
a

the

have
get

no

do

have
be
to
ensure
ordinary
people
pay
the
price
for
that
.
that
have
be
a
terrible
price
.
the
choice
we
be
offer
be
between
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
say
we
have
to
continue
down
this
road
and
take
a
further
€
2
billion
out
of
the
economy
,
thus
inflict
even
more
suffering
on
ordinary
people
,
or
the
government
's
claim
that
we
do
not
have
to
do
it
because
its
policy
be
such
a
fantastic
success
that
it
be
not
necessary
to
do
so
,
that
we
be
out
of
the
wood
now
due
to
its
policy
which
chart
the
way
forward
,
and
that
perhaps
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
do
not
fully
understand
just
how
fantastically
successful
the
government
's
policy
have
be
,
which
be
the
reason
it
be
not
necessary
to
make
a
further
cut
of
€
2
billion
.
both
of
that
option
be
false
,
but
there
be
aspect
of
truth
in
both
.
I
agree
with
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
's
statement
that
the
downside
risk
in
term
of
the
European
economy
be
such
that
we
must
be
careful
about
the
rather
spectacular
growth
projection
that
be
emerge
.
the
IFAC
have
a
good
point
to
make
about
there
be
a
serious
danger
involve
in
that
regard
.
I
worry
a
lot
about
the
government
's
current
triumphalism
in
term
of
the
project
growth
it
state
will
alleviate
the
debt
burden
,
solve
the
deficit
problem
,
and
chart
we
on
the
way
back
to
economic
recovery
and
out
of
a
boom
and
slump
cycle
.
I
do
not
see
that
at
all
.
there
be
a
problem
with
both
the
way
the
government
and
the
fiscal
Advisory
Council
look
at
the
situation
in
that
they
have
not
identify
what
it
be
that
produce
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
in
the
first
place
.
the
analysis
of
both
party
have
fail
to
address
that
fundamental
question
.
as
deputy
Paul
Murphy
indicate
,
there
be
a
significant
element
of
try
to
rewrite
what
happen
.
the
government
's
narrative
,
which
it
share
with
IFAC
,
be
that
the
problem
be
we
be
spend
way
beyond
we
means
and
therefore
it
be
all
about
rein
in
public
spending
to
avoid
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
.
I
put
it
to
the
minister
that
be
not
what
cause
the
crisis
.
I
be
amazed
the
minister
do
not
understand
that
and
I
be
shocked
beyond
belief
that
IFAC
,
as
a
body
of
economic
expert
,
do
not
understand
it
.
of
course
one
need
a
balance
budget
and
a
link
between
expenditure
and
revenue
,
but
the
claim
that
such
be
the
problem
be
simply
not
true
.
we
debt
be
manageable
until
the
crash
come
.
we
expenditure
be
not
vastly
outstrip
revenue
but
what
be
a
problem
be
the
type
of
growth
we
have
.
at
various
time
the
minister
acknowledge
the
point
,
although
even
when
he
be
in
opposition
he
do
not
do
much
about
it
.
very
few
people
-
really
only
the
left
-
call
for
a
stop
to
what
be
happen
and
say
the
focus
and
disproportionate
emphasis
on
the
property
sector
be
dangerous
and
be
a
accident
wait
to
happen
that
could
result
in
a
economic
crash
.
that
be
the
problem
that
lead
to
the
crash
,
which
be
facilitate
by
banker
,
rather
than
we
spend
more
than
we
be
get
in
revenue
.
I
be
worried
about
precisely
the
same
thing
now
.
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
real
analysis
either
from
the
government
or
IFAC
about
the
type
of
growth
that
be
necessary
if
we
want
to
get
out
of
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
.
could
the
minister
clarify
whether
we
plan
for
economic
growth
be
base
on
sustainable
model
where
one
take
into
account
what
we
produce
,
for
whom
,
and
whether
it
be
about
meet
the
need
of
people
and
society
or
if
it
be
just
about
growth
number
and
balance
sheet
?
that
be
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
approach
of
both
the
minister
and
IFAC
.
we
need
a
different
model
that
start
with
what
society
need
,
what
people
need
and
plan
to
meet
that
need
rather
than
the
market
model
which
be
just
about
rampant
,
naked
competition
which
be
what
produce
the
boom
and
bust
cycle
the
minister
say
he
want
to
get
away
from
.
hold
on
one
second
.
the
deputy
have
to
be
a
little
respectful
about
member
of
the
House
.
he
refer
to
a
Member
of
the
House
,
with
all
due
respect
.
the
deputy
can
not
be
allow
to
get
away
with
that
disrespectful
tone
.
deputy
Frank
Feighan
be
not
even
here
.
as
deputy
Aengus
Ó
Snodaigh
be
a
whip
,
under
stand
Order
69
he
be
entitle
to
call
a
vote

for
the
record
,
I
be
not
smirk
.
I
express
the
government
's
appreciation
of
the
support
express
by
some
Member
of
the
House
today
for
the
Stormont
House
agreement
and
the
government
's
role
in
negotiate
it
.
the
Stormont
House
agreement
be
a
necessity
.
the
month
before
the
political
talk
begin
be
characterise
by
political
deadlock
and
a
public
increasingly
disheartened
by
the
inability
of
the
political
system
to
deliver
reconciliation
and
economic
renewal
for
Northern
Ireland
.
the
talk
embody
the
collective
desire
at
Stormont
and
Westminster
and
in
Leinster
House
to
show
that
politics
can
deliver
by
address
a
range
of
contentious
issue
,
include
how
good
to
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
and
chart
a
way
forward
that
will
deliver
for
all
the
people
of
Northern
Ireland
.
the
Stormont
House
agreement
have
create
the
condition
necessary
to
allow
a
fresh
start
in
2015
and
beyond
.
it
be
the
potential
for
a
new
beginning
which
Northern
Ireland
's
leader
need
to
embrace
fully
.
I
will
address
some
of
the
point
raise
by
previous
speaker
,
in
particular
,
about
the
outstanding
commitment
of
previous
agreement
.
as
the
minister
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
,
have
underlin
,
the
government
remain
strongly
commit
to
ensure
outstanding
commitment
be
fulfil
.
it
must
be
repeat
that
,
notwithstand
that
commitment
,
the
agenda
for
the
most
recent
talk
be
essentially
focus
on
outstanding
commitment
arise
from
the
Good
Friday
and
St.
Andrew
's
agreement
,
the
foundational
agreement
of
the
peace
process
.
to
be
clear
,
the
Irish
government
be
not
a
party
to
the
negotiation
which
deal
specifically
with
budget
and
financial
reform
.
that
must
be
understand
for
the
historical
record
of
the
House
and
the
purpose
of
clarity
in
reply
to
some
of
the
point
raise
by
Member
opposite
.
while
the
case
of
the
late
Pat
Finucane
do
not
come
within
the
scope
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
,
the
position
of
the
Irish
government
on
this
important
point
have
not
change
.
a
commitment
to
have
a
public
inquiry
on
the
murder
of
Pat
Finucane
,
as
provide
for
in
the
Weston
Park
agreement
of
2001
,
should
be
honour
and
we
continue
to
raise
the
case
with
the
British
government
.
we
be
very
conscious
of
the
need
of
the
victim
and
survivor
in
the
South
,
include
the
family
of
the
victim
of
the
Dublin
and
Monaghan
bombing
and
other
.
the
new
independent
commission
on
information
retrieval
will
operate
North
and
South
.
when
appropriate
,
we
will
,
in
a
timely
fashion
,
legislate
for
it
.
in
term
of
what
be
explicitly
on
the
agenda
,
the
government
's
mandate
go
into
the
talk
be
to
facilitate
agreement
between
party
who
hold
very
different
and
differ
view
and
this
mean
make
a
realistic
assessment
of
what
be
possible
within
a
very
tight
timeframe
and
lock
down
the
good
possible
outcome
.
we
achieve
this
.
the
president
of
Sinn
Féin
,
one
of
the
party
opposite
,
have
sign
up
to
it
,
despite
some
of
the
attempt
to
revise
he
party
's
position
on
the
talk
.
have
sign
up
to
it
,
we
stand
over
it
.
it
be
a
matter
of
regret
that
the
executive
party
and
the
British
government
be
unable
to
agree
on
the
inclusion
of
the
Irish
language
act
in
the
Stormont
House
agreement
.
nevertheless
,
we
succeed
in
ensure
the
agreement
contain
a
important
and
formal
recognition
by
both
government
of
the
need
for
respect
for
and
recognition
of
the
Irish
language
in
Northern
Ireland
.
the
government
will
continue
to
advocate
for
the
enactment
of
a
Irish
language
Act
and
to
encourage
the
Northern
Ireland
party
which
support
a
act
to
continue
to
build
the
necessary
enable
consensus
among
they
executive
colleague
.
one
of
the
party
opposite
,
Sinn
Féin
,
be
part
of
the
executive
.
I
beg
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
's
indulgence
because
there
be
some
important
point
that
must
be
address
,
if
I
may
.
in
this
regard
,
I
be
encourage
the
recent
announcement
by
the
Northern
Ireland
Minister
for
Culture
,
Art
and
Leisure
,
Carál
Ní
Chuilín
,
of
she
intention
to
proceed
with
the
publication
of
Irish
and
Ulster
Scot
language
strategy
for
public
consultation
.
during
the
talk
,
we
advance
the
view
that
a
bill
of
rights
for
Northern
Ireland
could
set
out
precisely
and
formally
the
rights
upon
which
a
share
society
for
Northern
Ireland
could
be
base
.
regrettably
,
sufficient
consensus
between
the
Northern
Ireland
executive
party
do
not
exist
to
take
this
forward
within
the
context
of
the
Stormont
House
agreement
.
however
,
we
succeed
in
ensure
the
agreement
contain
a
agreement
by
the
party
to
serve
the
people
of
Northern
Ireland
equally
and
to
the
application
of
a
broad
range
of
associate
rights
.
regard
a
civic
forum
for
Northern
Ireland
,
during
the
talk
the
government
strongly
advance
we
position
that
great
civic
engagement
would
stimulate
inform
public
debate
on
key
societal
challenge
.
we
welcome
the
fact
that
the
Stormont
House
agreement
provide
for
the
establishment
of
a
civic
advisory
panel
to
meet
regularly
on
key
social
,
cultural
and
economic
issue
and
to
advise
the
Northern
Ireland
executive
.
as
minister
with
responsibility
for
North
-
South
co-operation
,
I
be
particularly
pleased
that
the
agreement
provide
for
a
number
of
concrete
all
-
island
measure
.
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
,
meeting
in
institutional
format
,
will
agree
,
by
the
end
of
February
2015
,
a
report
on
new
sectoral
priority
for
North
-
South
co-operation
identify
during
ministerial
discussion
since
November
2013
.
as
many
member
have
observe
,
a
key
to
realise
the
full
potential
of
the
agreement
lie
in
effective
and
timely
implementation
.
it
be
the
government
's
intention
that
the
new
framework
be
operational
as
soon
as
be
reasonably
possible
.
we
will
continue
to
take
a
hand
-
on
approach
.
in
the
month
ahead
,
the
government
will
continue
to
sustain
the
commitment
show
throughout
the
talk
and
play
we
part
in
ensure
the
full
implementation
of
the
agreement
.
Dáil
Éireann
will
maintain
its
important
role
in
guarantee
peace
and
reconciliation
across
the
island
of
Ireland
,
not
least
through
the
consideration
of
the
legislation
that
the
agreement
require
for
the
new
institution
in
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
.
I
look
forward
to
the
co-operation
and
support
of
the
Member
of
the
House
as
we
progress
this
important
work
,
through
the
leadership
of
the
minister

Charles
Flanagan

while
one
talk
about
reform
,

to
something
else

which
it
may

to
take
a

backwards

I
see
many
youngster
aged
15

who
,
at
one

in
the
past
,
when
they
go
through
the

government
intend
to
continue
this
strong
focus
in
2015
.
while
there
appear
to
have
be
a
welcome
slow
-
down
in
the
incidence
of
case
of
Ebola
in
recent
week
,
there
be
fluctuation
from
country
to
country
.
it
be
therefore
essential
that
the
international
community
maintain
its
resolve
to
defeat
the
epidemic
and
not
lose
the
momentum
of
its
response
.
the
World
Health
Organization
,
who
,
report
that
fatality
rate
for
hospitalise
patient
in
the
most
affect
country
be
between
57
%
and
60
%
,
which
still
be
too
high
.
however
,
death
outside
treatment
centre
be
significantly
under
-
report
,
make
it
difficult
to
provide
a
completely
accurate
case
fatality
rate
for
the
outbreak
as
a
whole
.
now
that
Ebola
transmission
rate
be
drop
slightly
and
pressure
on
bed
be
reduce
,
more
suspect
Ebola
case
will
go
directly
to
treatment
centre
rather
than
transite
through
hold
centre
while
await
test
result
.
this
will
allow
more
patient
to
receive
the
high
quality
of
care
at
a
early
stage
and
that
will
lead
to
improve
outcome
.
through
the
chair
,
I
wholeheartedly
agree
with
everything
deputy
Maureen
O'Sullivan
have
say
.
in
fairness
to
the
Irish
response
,
it
have
be
extremely
influential
in
influence
the
Unite
Nation
response
.
there
be
a
Unite
Nation
mission
on
the
ground
-
I
be
present
in
Freetown
on
the
very
weekend
it
arrive
-
and
because
of
the
presence
of
we
ambassador
and
team
on
the
ground
,
as
well
as
Irish
ngo
be
on
the
ground
in
Sierra
Leone
and
Liberia
,
we
be
able
to
influence
the
global
response
to
the
crisis
.
however
,
for
we
part
and
in
respect
of
we
response
as
a
nation
,
it
be
early
and
effective
.
while
I
agree
absolutely
with
deputy
O'Sullivan
when
she
state
there
be
more
fundamental
problem
,
the
government
have
a
embassy
and
accreditation
there
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
Sierra
Leone
be
third
from
last
on
the
human
development
index
.
this
signify
Ireland
's
commitment
to
that
country
on
the
very
issue
such
as
education
,
maternal
health
,
nutrition
,
gender
and
so
on
.
when
I
visit
,
I
speak
to
the
President
and
the
Minister
for
social
welfare
,
education
and
health
on
that
very
issue
because
the
government
believe
strongly
that
there
must
be
action
on
they
and
that
Ireland
have
a
role
to
play
in
assist
country
such
as
Sierra
Leone
in
that
respect
.
to
they
credit
,
the
Irish
ngo
be
work
directly
with
people
and
seek
to
empower
people
on
the
very
dynamic
about
which
the
deputy
have
speak
.
while
I
acknowledge
the
deputy
be
not
necessarily
make
this
point
,
Ireland
do
not
take
a
patronising
or
patriarchal
view
in
this
regard
.
we
help
people
to
empower
people
to
build
up
capacity
in
order
that
they
can
do
it
themselves
.
however
,
the
immediacy
of
the
Ebola
crisis
have
cause
the
government
to
shift
the
focus
towards
direct
funding
towards
that
crisis
per
se
by
direct
funding
to
thing
like
call
centre
,
community
mobilisation
and
psychosocial
issue
.
however
,
once
the
Ebola
crisis
be
over
,
the
work
to
which
the
deputy
refer
will
continue
apace
and
the
government
's
commitment
to
that
region
of
west
Africa
be
as
strong
as
it
ever
have
be
.
I
again
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
issue
.
as
with
other
bank
on
the
island
,
Ulster
Bank
experience
insolvency
problem
.
its
parent
,
the
Royal
Bank
of
Scotland
Group
,
be
under
the
regulatory
control
of
the
bank
of
England
rather
than
the
Irish
banking
system
.
the
bank
have
its
problem
and
at
one
point
some
year
ago
,
it
look
as
if
it
would
pull
out
of
Ireland
completely
.
such
a
scenario
would
have
be
a
great
loss
,
especially
in
the
northern
half
of
the
country
,
both
in
Northern
Ireland
and
the
Republic
of
Ireland
.
we
have
some
dialogue
,
include
with
Mark
Carney
,
the
Governor
of
the
Bank
of
England
,
and
we
get
assurance
that
the
Bank
of
England
would
support
the
continuation
of
Ulster
Bank
service
on
the
island
.
Ulster
Bank
will
continue
to
trade
as
a
competitive
bank
in
Northern
Ireland
and
the
Republic
of
Ireland
.
however
,
because
it
have
the
kind
of
problem
with
which
we
be
very
familiar
in
the
other
bank
,
it
begin
to
cut
its
cost
base
and
,
in
do
so
,
decide
to
close
some
branch
.
to
give
the
deputy
the
overall
picture
,
in
June
2014
,
Ulster
Bank
have
79
branch
in
Northern
Ireland
.
this
figure
decline
to
74
in
December
2014
and
it
be
project
to
fall
further
to
64
by
March
2015
.
Ulster
Bank
have
135
branch
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
in

2014
.
this
figure
decline
to
125
in
December
2014
and
it
be
project
to
fall
to
111
in

2015
.
notwithstanding
this
,
Ulster
Bank
remain
a
strong
retail
bank
trading
on
the
high
street
.
of
its
original
214
branch
North
and
South
,
199
remain
in
December
2014
and
the
bank
hope
the
figure
will
settle
at
175
in
March
2015
,
with
no
further
closure
after
that
date
.
the
bank
will
maintain
a
strong
network
.
on
the
specific
case
of
Ferbane
,
it
be
always
difficult
when
a
bank
that
traditionally
provide
service
leave
a
area
.
this
be
hard
on
customer
,
resident
and
individual
business
.
I
see
the
deputy
's
point
of
view
and
I
will
respond
to
he
request
and
the
request
of
other
deputy

by
ask
my

,
in

further
explore
whether
Ulster

can
enter
into
a
arrangement
with
a
Post
to
provide
alternative
service
for
the
people
of
Ferbane

it
be

I
again
thank
the

for

issue

which
deserve

highlight

I
move
:
"
that
report
stage
be
take
now
.
"
I
be
stand
in
for
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
.
the
effect
of
the
amendment
would
be
to
replace
the
current
three
-
member
gsoc
with
a
single
person
.
the
minister
appreciate
this
be
one
of
a
set
of
change
to
the
Garda
Síochána
Act
2005
that
have
be
recommend
by
the
Oireachtas
Joint
Committee
on
Justice
,
Defence
and
Equality
.
it
be
the
view
of
the
joint
committee
that
have
a
single
-
person
commission
would
provide
for
great
accountability
and
strengthen
its
overall
position
.
the
minister
have
consider
the
amendment
carefully
and
,
as
be
indicate
on
Committee
stage
,
there
be
,
of
course
,
more
involved
than
merely
a
change
to
the
number
of
commissioner
.
in
particular
the
minister
be
conscious
of
certain
advantage
from
have
a
three
-
person
body
and
she
believe
this
must
also
be
take
into
account
.
in
that
context
the
underlying
rationale
for
the
three
-
person
model
be
that
it
would
facilitate
bring
expertise
and
experience
across
a
range
of
different
sector
to
the
work
of
the
commission
.
in
addition
it
be
also
consider
to
be
a
practical
advantage
that
at
least
one
commissioner
would
always
be
available
to
guide
and
direct
operation
.
at
operational
level
,
GSOC
consider
this
to
be
a
significant
advantage
in
a
working
environment
as
that
face
by
the
commission
.
indeed
,
some
of
its
most
serious
and
sensitive
case
have
occur
at
weekend
and
during
holiday
period
.
moreover
,
a
three
-
person
commission
with
its
legally
require
gender
balance
and
its
range
of
experience
and
expertise
convey
a
strong
public
assurance
that
fairness
and
sensitivity
be
at
the
core
of
GSOC
's
approach
at
the
high
level
.
it
also
help
that
potential
difference
between
a
individual
commissioner
and
key
interlocutor
do
not
impinge
on
the
smooth
and
effective
running
of
the
organisation
.
the
minister
also
accept
that
up
to
recently
the
interaction
between
the
Garda
Síochána
Ombudsman
Commission
and
the
Garda
Síochána
have
not
be
function
,
if
one
like
,
as
effectively
as
it
should
.
however
,
this
be
a
area
in
which
substantial
work
be
be
undertake
by
both
organisation
.
furthermore
-
this
be
the
purpose
of
the
Bill
we
be
debate
today
-
additional
power
be
in
the
process
of
be
confer
on
GSOC
.
in
the
circumstance
the
minister
would
be
reluctant
to
alter
the
current
gsoc
structure
unless
it
could
be
show
that
a
significant
advantage
would
accrue
from
do
so
.
have
consider
the
overall
position
,
include
that
specific
arrangement
have
be
make
for
the
commission
,
through
a
nominate
member
to
account
to
Oireachtas
committee
,
the
minister
do
not
favour
move
to
a
one
-
person
commission
.
however
,
conscious
of
the
position
of
the
joint
committee
on
the
matter
,
the
minister
believe
this
be
a
aspect
that
need
to
be
keep
under
review
.
the
deputy
will
appreciate
the
consideration
that
have
be
give
to
he
amendment
.
in
the
circumstance
the
minister
hope
that
he
can
withdraw
the
amendment
.
with
regard
to
the
specific
question
from
deputy
Niall
Collins
,
we
acknowledge
that
the
vacancy
have
arise
for
the
chairperson
of
GSOC
on
foot
of
Mr.
O'Brien
's
resignation
.
the
appointment
of
member
of
the
Ombudsman
Commission
be
govern
by
section
65
of
the
Garda
Síochána
Act
2005
.
this
stipulate
that
the
commission
consist
of
three
member
,
all
of
whom
be
to
be
appoint
by
the
President
on
the
nomination
of
the
government
follow
the
passage
of
resolution
by
both
house
of
the
Oireachtas
recommend
the
appointment
.
the
2005
Act
require
that
the
government
be
satisfied
that
the
person
nominate
have
the
appropriate
experience
,
qualification
,
training
and
expertise
for
appointment
,
have
regard
to
the

2005
Act

will
consider
the
question

I
will
revert
to
the

Mr.
O'Brien
state
that
he
resignation
be
essentially
for
family
reason

with
regard
to
the
timing
and
advertisement
,
it
be
a
matter
for
a

decision
so
we
will
revert
to
deputy

point

I
note
the
point
make

the

have
set
out
its
position
on

the

state
that
it

something
she
will
keep

I
thank
all

I
thank
my

we
be
often
describe
as
a

but
this
be
one
motion
we
all
find
easy
to
support

the
response
of

in

the

disappointing

the
most
breathtaking
statement
in

be
the
line
to
the
effect
that
the

be
sustainable

that
it
be
possible
to

it
be
one
thing
to

a

there
be
a

most
of
what
we
be
repay
be
not
typical
national
debt
.
part
of
it
relate

while
a
major

of
it
relate
to
the

from
the

,
which
have
follow
-
on

in

it
would
be
entirely
different
if
we

however
,
there
be
no

reference
be
make
to
the
National

Fund
,
although
we
have
not
include
it
in

the

with

we
have

the
debate
may
well
be
over
for
tonight
in

but
it

I
thank
all
that
who
contribute
to
the
debate

in
particular
,
I
thank
my
colleague
in
the
technical
Group
.
we
be
often
describe
as
a
disparate
group
,
but
this
be
one
motion
we
all
find
easy
to
support
.
the
response
of
the
government
in
tab
the
amendment
be
disappointing
.
the
most
breathtaking
statement
in
the
amendment
be
the
line
to
the
effect
that
the
debt
be
sustainable
and
that
it
be
possible
to
repay
it
.
it
be
one
thing
to
service
a
debt
on
which
there
be
a
productive
return
but
most
of
what
we
be
repay
be
not
typical
national
debt
.
part
of
it
relate
to
the

collapse
,
while
a
major
share
of
it
relate
to
the
crash
in
tax
revenue
from
the
construction
sector
,
which
have
follow
-
on
consequence
in
other

it
would
be
entirely
different
if
we
be
pay

a

incur
in
build

,
a
public

system
to
reduce

the

be

billion
per

,
or
undertake
a
major

to
deliver

and

.
however
,
there
be
no
productive
aspect
to
most
of
we
debt
.
reference
be
make
to
the
National
Pension
Reserve
Fund
,
although
we
have
not
include
it
in
the
motion
.
the

be
plunder
,
but
the
pension

be
still
with

.
with
a

a

because

the

be
go
to
get
bad

article
yesterday

's
explanation
of
why
Ireland
be
not

Greek
call
for
the

the
minister
say
of
Ireland
's
€
214
billion
debt
:
"
we
debt
be
in
a
very
good
position
now
;
it
be
affordable
and
it
repayable
.
"
O'Toole
go
on
to
state
:
there
could
hardly
be
a
clear
message
to
we
gallant
ally
in
Europe
.
keep
you

you
would
only
be
insult
we
if
you
offer
we
a
dig

out
.
many
of
we
can
identify
with
this
.
I
seriously
question
the
notion
that
we
debt
be
on
a
downward
trajectory
.
the
world
debt
clock
show
that
we
be
pay
in
the
region
of
€339

in

.
therefore
,
in
the
five
minute
I
have
to
speak
tonight
we
will
have
add
€
100000
in
interest
to
we
debt
.
we
be
make
repayment
€
7.5
billion
to
service
the
national
debt
,
which
be
close
to
the
entire

budget

person
have
put
it
to
we
that
they
have
no

and
that
,
whereas
they
may
have
have
a
little
money
at
the
beginning
,
there
have
no

now
.
some
tell
we
that

something

that
show
how
marginal
the
balance
be
.
the
minister
say
the
debt
be
sustainable
and
repayable
in
the
name
of
the
people
struggle
so
badly
,
not
only
in

in

what
it
be
not

to
talk

think
about

month
ago
be
altogether
possible
now
.
it
be
not
only
in
Greece
where
this
debate
should
be
hold
.
let
we
consider
the
debt
problem
throughout
Europe
.
Italy

and

the

in

I
have
to
get
back
down
to
Cork
.
I
thank
deputy
Wallace
for
introduce
this
Bill
.
I
have
the
honour
of
set
out
the
government
's
position
on
it
.
this
be
the
second
time
in
three
week
that
the
House
have
debate
a
proposal
to
amend
the
constitution
by
insert
provision
concern
military
neutrality
.
I
will
focus
on
the
broad
issue
of
military
neutrality
before
turn
to
the
specific
proposal
in
deputy
Wallace
's
Bill
.
as
have
be
state
in
the
House
many
time
,
include
three
week
ago
,
the
government
be
commit
to
the
long
-
standing
policy
of
military
neutrality
,
which
enjoy
widespread
public
support
.
the
government
's
commitment
be
publicly
re-confirm
in
the
major
statement
of
foreign
policy
priority
that
it
publish
in
January
,
entitle
"
the
Global
Island
:
Ireland
's
foreign
Policy
for
a
Changing
World
"
.
the
statement
set
out
a
comprehensive
series
of
policy
priority
concern
Ireland
's
future
in
a
rapidly
change
world
,
include
secure
we
nation
's
prosperity
,
active
engagement
in
the
EU
,
promote
peace
and
reconciliation
on
this
island
,
engage
with
we
diaspora
,
provide
travel
document
and
assistance
for
we
citizen
when
travel
abroad
and
promote
we
value
.
it
be
on
this
last
point
that
I
wish
to
focus
.
as
the
statement
make
clear
,
"
article
29
of
the
Constitution
set
out
the
principle
that
guide
Ireland
's
conduct
of
its
international
relation
"
.
this
principle
include
"
the
ideal
of
peace
and
friendly
co-operation
amongst
nation
"
and
"
the
principle
of
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
dispute
"
.
it
further
confirm
that
we
foreign
policy
be
deeply
anchore
in
the
value
set
out
in
the
constitution
.
the
statement
reconfirm
that
we
policy
of
military
neutrality
remain
a
core
element
of
Irish
foreign
policy
.
in
line
with
this
policy
,
we
be
not
member
of
any
military
alliance
and
have
no
plan
to
join
any
.
however
,
military
neutrality
do
not
mean
that
we
take
a
insular
view
or
isolate
ourselves
from
the
world
.
we
be
conscious
of
we
duty
and
responsibility
to
do
what
we
can
to
prevent
and
alleviate
the
suffering
of
other
.
in
line
with
the
constitution
,
we
take
seriously
we
obligation
to
work
towards
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
dispute
.
moreover
,
we
export
-
orient
economy
rely
on
a
stable
rule
-
base
international
system
for
the
trade
,
investment
and
tourism
flow
on
which
the
prosperity
of
we
people
depend
.
the
government
,
therefore
,
believe
in
active
global
engagement
and
in
contribute
to
international
effort
to
secure
similar
peace
and
prosperity
in
other
part
of
this
interconnected
world
.
we
do
this
through
policy
aim
at
combate
poverty
and
hunger
,
principally
through
the
government
's
Irish
Aid
programme
;
advance
human
rights
;
promote
disarmament
;
and
work
through
the
UN
,
the
EU
and
with
we
international
partner
to
promote
international
peace
and
stability
.
the
contribution
make
by
Irish
troops
to
peacekeeping
mission
be
at
the
heart
of
we
strategy
.
thousand
of
man
and
woman
have
make
a
invaluable
contribution
to
keep
the
peace
in
country
ravage
by
year
of
conflict
.
we
troops
have
a
distinguished
track
record
and
a
well
-
deserve
international
reputation
earn
over
many
decade
.
to
meet
the
grow
demand
for
peace
operation
,
the
UN
have
increasingly
turn
to
regional
organisation
such
as
the
EU
,
the
African
Union
and
NATO
to
manage
operation
on
its
behalf
and
under
its
authority
.
Ireland
have
actively
contribute
to
the
shaping
of
the
EU'
common
Security
and
Defence
Policy
,
CSDP
,
which
equip
the
Union
to
take
on
crisis
management
operation
outside
the
EU
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
the
UN
Charter
.
the
operation
of
the
CSDP
be
entirely
consistent
with
Irish
foreign
policy
tradition
and
principle
.
it
be
guide
by
a
comprehensive
approach
which
seek
to
tackle
the
underlying
cause
as
well
as
the
manifestation
of
conflict
.
the
EU
now
have
a
wide
range
of
competence
equip
it
to
make
a
significant
contribution
to
peace

the

and
civilian
operation
since
2002
.
member
of
the
Defence
Force
have
participate
in
some
of
this
mission
.
however
,
the
majority
of
mission
be
civilian
in
nature
and
involve
the
deployment
of
police
officer
and

expert
.
this
EU
mission
be

and
design
to
contribute
to
international
peace
and
security
.
they
be
not
related
to
internal
EU
security
or
territorial
defence
.
they
rely
on
contribution
make
by
the
sovereign
decision
of

in
Ireland
's
case
,
Defence
force
deployment
be
,
and
will
continue
to
be
,
govern
by
the
triple
lock
mechanism
which
be
set
out
in
legislation
.
lest
there
be
any
lingering
concern
arise
from
recent
comment
in
the
course
of
a
interview
by
the
President
of
the
European
Commission
,
Mr.
Jean
Claude
Juncker
,
I
want
to
make
clear
that
there
be
no
European
army
,
nor
be
there
any
basis
for
one
.
the
protocol
on
the
concern
of
the
Irish
people
to
the
Treaty
of
Lisbon
,
which
be
annex
to
the
Treaty
on
the
European
Union
,
make
clear
that
the
treaty
do
not
affect
or
prejudice
we
military
neutrality
.
the
protocol
also
state
that
the
treaty
do
not
provide
for
the
creation
of
a
European
army
.
the
treaty
itself
state
that
there
will
be
no
common
defence
unless
the
European
Council
unanimously
so
decide
and
article
29.4.9
prohibit
Irish
participation
in
such
a
common
defence
.
before
turn
to
the
Bill
propose
by
deputy
Wallace
,
I
want
to
refer
briefly
to
the
issue
of
the
use
of
Shannon
Airport
by
the
US
.
this
be
a
long
-
standing
practice
which
have
be
in
place
for
over
50
year
.
we
have
never
withdraw
or
suspend
the
use
of
facility
at
Shannon
at
any
stage
during
that
period
.
Ireland
have
not
enter
into
a
military
alliance
with
the
US
or
with
any
other
country
or
organisation
.
permit
the
use
of
Shannon
by
the
US
do
not
challenge
this
position
in
any
way
and
successive
government
have
consider
that
this
be
compatible
with
we
policy
of
military
neutrality
.
let
I
turn
to
the
Bill
propose
by
deputy
Wallace
.
the
Bill
propose
that
the
constitution
should
be
amend
to
require
adherence
to
the
provision
of
the
1907
Hague
Convention
(
V
)
,
respect
the
rights
and
duty
of
neutral
power
and
person
in
case
of
war
on
land
.
I
will
quote
the
exact
schedule
propose
to
be
insert
into
the
constitution
:
Ireland
's
neutral
status
shall
be
affirm
by
adherence
to
the
provision
of
the
1907
Hague
Convention
(
V
)
respect
the
Right
and
Duties
of
Neutral
Powers
and
Person
in
Case
of
War
on
Land
.
as
deputy
Wallace
will
be
aware
,
this
be
one
of
13
convention
adopt
on
18
October
1907
at
the
conclusion
of
the
second
Hague
Peace
Conference
.
the
convention
be
a
product
of
a
historical
context
which
concern
the
sovereign
right
of
state
to
wage
war
.
this
right
have
for
century
be
regard
as
a
legitimate
instrument
of
a
state
's
national
policy
.
the
law
of
neutrality
represent
a
logical
accompaniment
to
the
sovereign
right
of
state
to
wage
war
.
in
other
word
,
state
which
do
not
wish
to
be
consider
as
participant
in
a
war
have
the
legal
right
to
insist
on
respect
for
they
rights
as
neutral
party
and
as
neutral
party
have
to
comply
with
certain
legal
obligation
under
the
convention
.
however
,
just
two
decade
late
,
the
right
to
wage
war
be
relinquish
by
practically
all
state
under
the
1928
General
Treaty
for
the
Renunciation
of
War.
William
T.
Cosgrave
,
act
on
behalf
of
the
then
Irish
Free
State
,
be
among
the
original
signatory
to
the
treaty
which
declare
that
the
contracting
party
condemn
recourse
to
war
and
renounce
it
as
a
instrument
of
national
policy
in
they
relation
with
one
another
.
the
treaty
further
state
that
the
settlement
or
solution
of
all
dispute
or
conflict
of
whatever
nature
or
of
whatever
origin
they
may
be
shall
never
be
seek
except
by
pacific
means
.
the
prohibition
on
war
be
reinforce
with
the
adoption
in
1945
of
the
Charter
of
the
Unite
Nation
.
article
2
(
3
)
of
the
charter
require
all
member
to
settle
they
dispute
by
peaceful
means
.
under
article
2
(
4
)
,
UN
member
"
shall
refrain
in
they
international
relation
from
the
threat
or
use
of
force
against
the
territorial
integrity
or
political
independence
of
any
state
,
or
in
any
other
manner
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
Unite
Nation
.
"
whereas
the
1907
convention
be
design
to
allow
neutral
state
to
stay
out
of
a
war
,
it
have
largely
be
supersede
by
the
Charter
of
the
Unite
Nation
which
set
out
a
framework
of
internationally
accept
principle
concern
collective
security
.
the
old
distinction
between
belligerent
and
neutral
be
no
long
relevant
as
war
be
prohibit
by
international
law
.
under
the
UN
Charter
the
use
of
force
be
permit
only
in
individual
or
collective
self
defence
or
where
authorise
by
the
Security
Council
in

to
maintain
or
restore

peace
and

.
where
the

include

action

to

international
peace
and
security
,
member
state
not
participate
in
that
measure
be
nevertheless
oblige
under
article
2
(
5
)
to
"
give
the
United
Nation
every
assistance
in
any
action
it
take
"
in
accordance
with
the
Charter
.
UN
member
state
may
also
be
require
to
implement
sanction
impose
by
the
Security
Council
against
a
state
.
thus
it
may
no
long
be
possible
for
a
UN
member
state
to
remain
neutral
in
the
manner
prescribe
by
the
1907
convention
.
furthermore
,
the
1907
convention
apply
to
the
wage
of
war
,
which
be
a
armed
conflict
between
state
,
but
it
do
not
apply
to
conflict
within
a
state
or
to
conflict
between
state
and
non-state
actor
which
represent
the
vast
majority
of
modern
armed
conflict
.
it
refer
to
the
passage
of
troops
over
land
or
by
sea
,
but
because
it
be
a
product
of
its
time
it
make
no
reference
to
modern
mode
of
transport
,
include
air
travel
,
or
to
new
development
in
technology
.
the
1907
Hague
Convention
should
be
regard
as
a
product
of
its
time
.
just
33
country
be
state
party
to
the
convention
,
with
just
two
of
this
ratify
the
convention
after
the
1928
general
treaty
come
into
force
,
which
be
Ethiopia
in
1935
and
Belarus
in
1962
.
Ireland
fully
subscribe
to
the
provision
of
the
1928
general
treaty
and
the
UN
Charter
.
the
government
see
little
point
in
ratify
a
convention
which
have
its
root
in
a
right
to
wage
war
which
,
as
I
have
outline
,
be
now
prohibit
by
international
law
.
with
the
adoption
of
the
UN
Charter
,
it
be
far
from
clear
how
it
apply
in
the
modern
world
.
the
case
for
ratify
the
convention
be
weak
,
but
the
case
for
include
a
reference
to
it
in
the
constitution
,
to
bind
the
State
by
its
provision
,
be
weak
still
.
three
week
ago
,
the
government
reject
the
case
for
insert
provision
on
neutrality
into
the
constitution
.
the
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
,
deputy
Jimmy
Deenihan
,
note
that
the
objective
of
the
private
Member
's
Bill
propose
by
deputy
Seán
Crowe
be
well
intentioned
but
that
to
insert
that
provision
into
the
constitution
be
neither
necessary
nor
desirable
.
that
argument
apply
equally
to
this
Bill
.
as
I
say
in
my
open
remark
,
there
have
be
a
long
-
standing
commitment
by
successive
government
to
the
policy
of
military
neutrality
.
this
government
remain
fully
committed
to
this
policy
and
have
re­affirm
the
commitment
in
the
global
island
policy
.
article
29
(
2
)
of
the
constitution
confirm
Ireland
's
adherence
to
the
principle
of
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
dispute
and
it
prohibit
participation
in
any
EU
common
defence
.
Ireland
's
policy
on
military
neutrality
be
acknowledge
and
protect
in
the
legal
guarantee
obtain
in
the
context
of
ratification
of
the
Lisbon
Treaty
.
in
addition
to
all
this
important
provision
,
the
condition
which
must
be
satisfied
to
permit
Irish
participation
in
overseas
military
operation
be
set
out
in
legislation
under
the
triple
lock
mechanism
.
in
view
of
this
provision
,
the
government
do
not
consider
that
a
constitutional
provision
on
neutrality
be
require
.
I
would
be
concerned
about
the
potential
implication
of
a
constitutional
provision
that
require
the
State
to
act
in
keep
with
a
convention
which
have
in
large
measure
be
overtake
by
development
in
international
law
and
which
may
even
be
inconsistent
with
the
UN
Charter
.
I
do
not
think
that
this
House
would
wish
Ireland
to
find
itself
in
a
position
where
it
must
refuse
to
take
part
in
a
UN
-
mandate
peace
operation
or
must
refuse
to
implement
sanction
approve
by
the
Security
Council
because
the
constitution
have
be
amend
in
such
a
way
that
we
have
to
act
in
the
manner
in
which
a
neutral
state
would
have
do
at
a
time
of
war
in
1907
.
I
do
not
believe
that
this
House
would
support
a
provision
which
potentially
might
tie
the
government
's
hand
and
prevent
it
from
take
a
public
position
on
incident
of
gross
violation
of
human
rights
or
the
commission
of
war
crime
that
may
occur
during
a
conflict
because
it
be
require
under
the
constitution
to
adhere
to
a
strictly
neutral
position
as
set
out
in
the
Hague
Convention
.
the
world
have
move
on
since
1907
.
we
no
long
live
in
a
era
of
belligerent
adhere
to
a
outmoded
law
on
the
right
to
wage
war
.
we
live
in
the
modern
world
,
a
world
in
which
we
and
most
other
state
regard
the
Unite
Nation
as
the
forum
within
which
dispute
should
be
settle
,
and
the
UN
Charter
as
the
set
of
principle
to
which
all
state
should
adhere
.
we
must
look
to
the
future
and
it
be
on
that
basis
that
the
government
be
not
accept
the
Bill
.
I
be
refer
to
the
1907
convention
,
so
the
deputy
should
not
forget
the
historical
narrative
.
many
point
have
be
raise
that
to
be
frank
and
respectful
be
extraneous
to
the
Bill
at
hand
.
in
the
short
time
available
to
I
,
with
due
respect
to
deputy
Wallace
,
I
propose
to
respond
to
the
Bill
itself
.
I
will
leave
it
to
the
historian
to
testify
to
the
verbosity
and
veracity
of
some
of
the
point
that
have
be
make
by
Member
opposite
.
it
have
be
a
interesting
debate
with
some
very
lively
contribution
.
I
sincerely
thank
deputy
Wallace
for
introduce
the
Bill
.
three
week
ago
,
the
government
make
clear
in
relation
to
a
separate
private
member
'
Bill
that
it
do
not
consider
it
necessary
or
desirable
to
incorporate
provision
on
neutrality
into
the
constitution
.
this
House
debate
and
subsequently
vote
against
the
Bill
.
my
view
and
that
of
the
government
be
that
be
the
correct
decision
.
the
conclusion
that
the
propose
legislation
in
this
area
be
unnecessary
and
undesirable
apply
even
more
strongly
to
the
Bill
before
we
today
.
this
be
a
Bill
which
serve
no
useful
purpose
in
the
modern
era
.
some
of
the
sentence
that
be
parse
from
the
speech
I
make
early
have
be
use
out
of
context
.
I
would
welcome
a
future
opportunity
to
elaborate
on
that
but
my
time
today
be
restrict
.
the
1907
convention
must
be
consider
in
the
grand
historical
context
and
that
be
what
be
pertinent
to
the
Bill
and
the
wording
that
be
propose
in
term
of
the
change
to
the
constitution
.
the
Bill
be
not
necessary
because
the
government
remain
commit
to
the
policy
of
military
neutrality
follow
by
successive
government
over
decade
.
the
commitment
have
be
reconfirm
in
the
Global
Island
review
which
state
:
"
we
policy
of
military
neutrality
remain
a
core
element
of
Irish
foreign
policy
.
"
it
may
only
be
refer
to
twice
but
it
be
there
and
it
be
inherent
within
government
policy
.
the
Bill
be
also
unnecessary
give
that
the
constitution
already
commit
Ireland
to
"
the
ideal
of
peace
and
friendly
cooperation
amongst
nation
"
and
to
"
the
principle
of
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
dispute
.
"
the
strict
condition
under
which
we
Defence
Force
personnel
may
be
deploy
overseas
be
set
out
in
legislation
.
we
neutrality
be
also
fully
respect
by
the
EU
treaty
and
confirm
by
the
protocol
on
the
concern
of
the
Irish
people
to
the
Treaty
of
Lisbon
.
some
of
the
Member
opposite
must
reflect
on
they
position
in
regard
to
that
same
treaty
when
it
be
put
before
the
people
.
the
government
be
of
the
view
that
as
well
as
be
unnecessary
,
incorporation
of
the
propose
amendment
into
the
constitution
would
not
be
desirable
.
deputy
Wallace
's
Bill
would
have
we
insert
into
the
constitution
a
bind
reference
to
a
convention
conclude
more
than
a
century
ago
.
this
be
a
convention
ratify
by
just
33
country
,
13
of
they
member
of
NATO
.
no
country
have
ratify
the
convention
for
more
than
50
year
.
I
say
that
for
the
benefit
of
deputy
Clare
Daly
.
I
repeat
that
this
be
a
convention
ratify
by
33
country
,
13
of
they
member
of
NATO
.
the
deputy
may
say
that
we
be
parrote
-
to
use
she
phrase
-
word
that
be
use
three
week
ago
,
but
I
respectfully
submit
to
this
House
that
the
message
be
still
the
same
and
it
be
no
less
potent
by
its
repetition
.
I
wish
to
inform
deputy
Clare
Daly
,
through
the
chair
,
that
no
country
have
ratify
the
convention
for
more
than
50
year
and
only
three
have
ratify
it
since
the
conclusion
of
the
first
World
War
.
I
speak
specifically
and
respectfully
to
deputy
Wallace
's
Bill
in
response
.
one
could
ask
why
that
be
so
.
it
be
because
the
convention
be
no
long
relevant
to
the
contemporary
world
.
it
have
be
make
redundant
by
subsequent
legal
agreement
,
namely
,
by
the
General
Treaty
of
1928
and
by
the
UN
Charter
of
1945
.
regardless
of
all
of
the
issue
that
be
honestly
submit
by
member
opposite
in
regard
to
issue
of
neutrality
-
I
refer
to
issue
relate
to
Palestine
,
Cuba
and
whether
cabinet
member
be
for
or
against
NATO
-
and
again
in
the
context
of
the
Bill
before
the
House
,
we
respond
accordingly
and
efficiently
to
what
have
be
raise
in
the
provision
in
the
propose
Bills
.
the
government
believe
in
a
modern
constitution
for
a
modern
Ireland
that
take
a
active
role
in
a
modern
world
.
we
see
no
point
in
accord
constitutional
status
to
a
convention
which
be
no
long
relevant
;
which
in
large
measure
have
be
overtake
by
development
in
international
law
;
which
refer
to
telegraph
and
telephone
cable
and
to
the
erection
of
wireless
telegraphy
station
;
and
which
have
not
attract
a
single
new
adherent
in
more
than
half
a
century
.
I
realise
that
my
time
be
up
.
while
the
government
do
not
support
the
Bill
,
that
be
not
to
say
that
we
do
not
respect
the
spirit
in
which
the
Bill
have
be
introduce
.
we
believe
the
aim
of
it
,
which
be
to
seek
to
instil
within
the
Constitution
the
1907
Hague
Convention
,
be
not
the
pertinent
way
to
deal
with
the
entirety
of
the
issue
of
neutrality
.
deputy
Wallace
should
deal
with
he
Bill
.
I
be
sorry
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
be
not
rubbish
it
.

small

medium
-
size
enterprise
will
continue
to
be
critical
to
we
economic
recovery
and
the
government
will
continue
to
support
they
,
whether
through
start
up
or
scaling
phase
.
sme
will
continue
to
provide
vital
job
and
goods
and
service
in

community
and
region
,
and
consequently
it
be
in
all
of
we
interest
that

bear
,
survive

thrive

I
take
the
point
make
on
the
failure
of
sme
and
the
point
make
by
deputy
Kelleher
on
venture
capital
and
take
equity

.
the
metric
will
show
clearly
the
government
have
a
very
strong
record
,
as
do
the
venture
capital
community
,
in
take
punt
on
many
sme
,
particularly
at
present
.
person
talk
about
a
paradigm
shift
but
a
new
dialogue
have
open
up
about
the
notion
of
fear
of
failure
.
we
all
subscribe
to
the
idea
one
can
fail
quickly
and
move
on
and
start
something
new
.
this
apply
mainly
in
the
tech
sector
.
in
other
sector
of
the
economy
one
must
be
a
little
more
reticent
and
careful
about
the
rhetoric
we
use
,
because
sometimes
the
failure
of
a
entity
involve
many
creditor
and
we
must
have
mechanism
in
place
so
people
can
find
relief
with
regard
to
debt
incur
by
a
company
.
we
do
not
want
to
have
a
system
which
be
too
loose
so
people
could
turn
over
entity
too
easily
whereby
many
people
be
leave
hang
for
want
of
the
expedition
of
the
debt
which
would
arise
from
such
activity
.
I
take
the
point
,
which
be
valid
,
but
we
need
to
be
careful
about
how
we
evolve
such
a
culture
in
this
country
.
we
have
to
state
for
the
record
that
as
strong
as
the
foreign
direct
investment
base
be
in
this
country
,
more
job
be
support
by
Enterprise
Ireland
and

office

in

by
the
end
of

Enterprise
Ireland

company
respectively
,
while

employment
in

client
company
stand
at
approximately
174500
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
English
,
indicate
yesterday
that
we
aim
be
to
create
100000
new
job
by
2016
and
we
think
this
be
a
realistic
proposition
.
we
be
well
on
we
way
,
with
a
extra
90000
job
have
be
create
in
net
term
since
the
Action
plan
for
Jobs
be
launch
in

we
be
well
on
we
way
to
reach
the
100000
extra
job
during
this
year
,
a
full
18
month
ahead

we
facilitate
formal
mechanism
for

engagement
with

through
the
advisory
group
on

,
the
high
level

the

this
formal
mechanism
can
and
do
feed
into
the
action

for

and
the
budget
process
,
ensure
facilitate
structure
and
regular
dialogue
between

very
sector
about

we
be
speak
,
which
be
the
small

,
on
any
issue
of
concern
and
on
how
to
promote
the
economic
development

potential

it
must
be

that

a
ongoing
challenge

one
of
the
issue
which
cause
small

the
most
headache
be
the
lack
of
clarity
about
what
they
be
suppose
to

and
Innovation
launch
actionplanforjobs.ie
and
have
partner
with
a
number
of
industry
ambassador
to
create
awareness
of
the
support
available
.
this
be
part
of
a
wide
effort
.
another
example
be
the
government
's
take
care
of
business
event
,
which
also
demonstrate
we
commitment
to
ensure
sme
have
easy
access
to
the
information
they
require
to
run
a
business
as
efficiently
and
effectively
as
possible
.
we
also
have
the
31
local
enterprise
office
,
leo
,
which
form
a
first
stop
shop
approach
for
business
in
each
community
and
this
will
continue
to
develop
relationship
.
if
we
look
at
the
metric
from
last
week
we
clearly
see
job
growth
from
the
activity
of
the
LEOs
.
it
be
four
year
since
we
take
office
and
we
economy
grow
by
4.8
%
last
year
.
it
be
the
fast
-
grow
economy
in
the
European
Union
.
when
we
start
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
the
unemployment
rate
be
at
15.1
%
.
it
have
fall
to
10
%
and
it
will
fall
below
10
%
very
shortly
.
I
thank
my
colleague
from
all
side
of
the
House
who
have
speak
since
yesterday
evening
on
this
topic
.
the
intention
be
to
place
sme
,
which
give
350000
people
a
income
in
this
country
on
a
daily
basis
,
at
the
centre
of
the
political
debate
.
we
have
succeed
to
some
degree
in
that
regard
,
give
the
media
coverage
and
discussion
on
this
topic
.
the
intention
of
the
motion
be
to
lay
down
some
very
specific
requirement
.
rather
than
go
for
a
scattergun
motion
and
throw
everything
in
with
it
,
we
lay
down
very
specific
request
,
such
as
the
introduction
of
a
earn
income
tax
credit
,
the
provision
of
prsi
and
social
protection
payment
,
a
information
campaign
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
to
highlight
the
service
and
benefit
available
to
self
-
employ
people
,
a
expansion
of
the
role
of
the
Strategic
Banking
Corporation
of
Ireland
,
change
in
capital
gain
tax
and
a
extension
to
the
credit
guarantee
scheme
.
while
all
that
thing
be
mention
approvingly
by
various
government
speaker
,
what
we
will
actually
be
voting
on
be
,
as
I
describe
it
last
night
,
the
labrador
puppy
of
government
amendment
.
everybody
love
it
.
everybody
will
pat
it
on
the
head
and
tell
it
,
"
you
be
a
great
lad
"
,
but
there
be
nothing
specific
there
that
we
can
hold
the
government
to
account
on
in
term
of
address
all
the
problem
that
have
be
raise
by
speaker
on
all
side
of
the
House
about
sme
.
this
be
why
we
will
vote
on
the
government
amendment
.
there
be
nothing
specific
in
term
of
address
a
insolvency
system
that
be
not
work
and
not
deliver
,
and
which
will
not
work
and
will
not
deliver
under
the
current
scheme
.
no
mention
be
make
over
the
two
night
of
why
the
Fine
Gael
Party
be
sell
out
the
Labour
Party
again
in
respect
of
the
bankruptcy
term
,
why
the
Fine
Gael
Party
be
not
bring
we
in
the
twenty
-
six
County
into
line
with
Northern
Ireland
and
England
in
term
of
bankruptcy
law
and
why
the
Taoiseach
continue
to
stick
he
head
in
the
sand
regard
the
inadequacy
of
we
insolvency
network
.
we
need
a
insolvency
system
that
will
deliver
for
all
cohort
,
but
particularly
for
sme
.
there
be
nothing
specific
regard
the
credit
guarantee
scheme
and
why
,
after
a
review
publish
in
mid-2014
,
which
highlight
its
inadequacy
,
we
be
now
move
rapidly
towards
mid-2015
and
we
be
no
further
on
in
term
of
change
the
scheme
and
address
that
inadequacy
.
meanwhile
,
business
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
country
that
need
access
to
that
facility
be
have
they
loan
sell
out
from
under
they
by
bank
.
they
be
be
sell
to
foreign
fund
with
no
respect
,
no
understanding
and
no
thought
for
the
selfless
effort
that
have
go
into
build
up
that
business
and
for
the
people
who
be
work
in
that
business
.
they
need
a
reform
credit
guarantee
scheme
,
but
it
be
not
a
priority
.
it
be
put
on
the
long
finger
.
as
I
say
when
I
open
this
debate
last
night
,
this
system
do
not
understand
how
it
be
for
someone
to
arrive
into
work
on
a
Monday
morning
and
not
know
if
they
will
have
money
to
pay
they
employee
,
never
mind
themselves
.
it
do
not
understand
what
it
be
like
for
someone
to
go
for
week
on
end
without
receive
a
cent
until
somebody
pay
they
,
and
then
they
must
pay
Revenue
,
the
Department
of
social
Protection
,
they
supplier
and
only
then
,
if
there
be
anything
leave
,
will
the
business
owner
get
pay
.
life
as
a
sme
owner
be
not
,
as
people
like
to
portray
it
,
all
champagne
,
yacht
and
big
car
.
it
be
very
tough
.
a
system
that
do
not
understand
and
whose
every
response
demonstrate
that
lack
of
understanding
need
to
come
on
that
journey
and
to
understand
how
it
be
to
go
without
be
pay
.
then
we
might
see
urgency
around
the
credit
guarantee
scheme
and
the
need
for
a
new
business
bank
.
instead
of
set
up
and
give
money
to
bank
that
have
fail
Irish
business
,
and
small
business
in
particular
,
we
need
to
set
up
a
new
business
bank
and
take
they
on
.
the
money
be
there
to
do
it
.
that
be
what
this
two
night
have
be
about
-
inject
urgency
into
this
system
and
into
the
minister
's
Department
about
sme
and
not
treat
they
like
some
little
child
to
be
pat
on
the
back
and
tell
:
"
you
be
a
great
lad
.
stay
there
in
the
corner
,
be
quiet
and
do
not
embarrass
we
.
"
sme
be
the
lifeblood
of
this
economy
.
they
will
get
this
country
back
on
its
foot
.
it
be
time
we
have
a
government
and
a
system
that
respect
they
.
the
amendment
show
no
respect
and
no
understanding
of
the
position
sme
be
in
at
present
and
that
be
why
we
will
oppose
it
.
this
be
a
complete
abuse
of
privilege
.
that
be
just
not
true
.
who
appoint
he
?
they
do
not
understand
the
answer
.
this
current
issue
relate
to
pancrea
transplantation
,
not
kidney
transplantation
.
dialysis
be
for
kidney
treatment
and
not
pancrea
problem
.
the
renal
unit
seem
to
be
work
relatively
well
in
Beaumont
.
certainly
,
it
have
not
be
the
case
that
any
kidney
that
could
have
be
transplant
in
Ireland
be
export
or
anything
like
that
.
I
be
not
involved
in
recruitment
to
individual
post
in
Beaumont
or
any
other
hospital
,
but
I
understand
the
hospital
have
difficulty
fill
the
post
in
question
.
it
be
advertise
and
the
hospital
be
unable
to
get
someone
.
that
be
a
ongoing
problem
in
we
health
service
.
what
would
happen
in
the
private
sector
be
that
a
organisation
would
go
out
and
head
-
hunt
someone
and
pay
the
person
whatever
have
to
be
pay
,
but
that
be
not
how
the
public
service
work
.
we
do
not
give
market
rate
to
individual
people
.
for
various
reason
,
the
public
service
be
different
from
the
private
sector
in
that
regard
,
for
good
and
for
bad
.
anyway
,
the
important
thing
now
be
that
the
new
arrangement
be
be
put
in
place
.
it
be
anticipate
that
the
arrangement
will
be
fully
in
place
within
the
next
couple
of
week

the

do

deputy

should
read
back
on

report
late
on

I
thank
the
Acting
chairman
.
deputy
McGrath
may
heckle
away
.
let
I
say
in
the
first
instance
that
I
recognise
the
purpose
behind
the
Bill
propose
by
deputy
Pringle
and
welcome
the
opportunity
to
debate
the
issue
.
while
I
oppose
the
Bill
I
would
like
to
assure
the
Deputy
that
the
government
be
fully
commit
to
economic
,
social
and
cultural
development
within
Ireland
through
the
annual
allocation
of
money
and
resource
via
the
Oireachtas
and
also
in
the
context
of
international
co-operation
.
as
Minister
of
State
at
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
I
would
like
to
begin
by
set
out
we
commitment
to
human
rights
in
the
international
context
.
at
the
end
of
this
year
,
Ireland
will
conclude
a
three
-
year
term
on
the
UN
human
Right
Council
.
on
the
council
,
Ireland
have
work
to
promote
and
protect
the
human
rights
of
all
people
,
particularly
the
marginalised
and
most
vulnerable
.
I
be
particularly
proud
of
the
resolution
we
lead
on
combat
preventable
mortality
and
morbidity
of
child
under
five
year
of
age
.
the
promotion
and
protection
of
human
rights
be
one
of
six
priority
area
within
we
international
development
policy
.
Ireland
remain
commit
to
achieve
the
UN
target
of
0.7
%
of
GNP
in
official
development
assistance
as
we
economy
improve
.
we
give
particular
importance
to
the
role
of
the
UN
human
rights
treaty
monitoring
body
.
in
2014
,
Ireland

the
UN

that
country
that
have

convention
.
Ireland
's

the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
.
next
month
,
on
8
and
9
June
,
Ireland

under
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
will
be

the
UN

I
will

will
be
compose
of
official
from
my
Department
and
from
the
Department
with
responsibility
for
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
.
of
course
,
we
acknowledge
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
the
promotion
and
protection
of
human
rights
lie
within
the
state
themselves
.
we
appreciate
the
important
role
of
the

,
and
all
of
the
Unite
Nation

in
hold
state

be
proud
to
play
a
instrumental
role

body
,
call
the
Dublin
process

as
two

hold
in
Iveagh
House
.
I
be
not
sure
if
it
have
be

we
will
make
provision
for
that
.
I
apologise
to
the
House
if
the
script
have
not
be
make
available
.
I
be
sure
my
official
be
watch
now
and
can
ensure
that
it
happen
.
without
doubt
.
in
March
,
the
government
establish
a
interdepartmental
committee
on
human
rights
to
improve
co-ordination
throughout
the
government
on
the
promotion
and
protection
of
human

in
we
foreign
policy
.
the
interdepartmental
committee
will
progress
ratification
by
Ireland
of
key

treaty
,
monitor
the
implementation
of
Ireland
's
treaty
obligation
,
and
facilitate
timely
reporting
to
international
treaty
body
in
accordance
with
this
obligation
.
as
chair
of
the
interdepartmental
committee
,
I
look
forward
to
watch
it
bear
fruit
as
it
become
embed
in
we
operational
process
.
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
be
the
main
treaty
protect
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
.
it
be
adopt
,
as
have
be
state
,
and
be
open
for
signature
,
ratification
and
accession
by
the
General
Assembly
in
1966
.
it
enter
into
force
on
3
January
1976
.
Ireland
sign
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
in
1973
and
ratify
it
in
1989
.
the
covenant
have
be
ratify
by
164
country
,
include
all
EU
member
state
.
the
covenant
contain
some
of
the
most
significant
international
legal
provision
establish
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
,
include
rights
relate
to
work
in
just
and
favourable
condition
,
to
social
protection
,
to
a
adequate

of

,
to
the
high
attainable

of
physical

mental
health
,
to
education
,
to
take
part
in
cultural
life
and
to
enjoyment
of
the
benefit
of
scientific
progress
.
in
November
2000
Ireland
ratify
the
1996
revise
European
social
Charter
,
which
be
the
Council
of
Europe
's
treaty
on
social
and
economic
rights
.
I
note
two
of
the
Deputy
opposite
have
leave
the
Chamber
.
I
hope
they
will
be
in
a
position
to
at
least
have
regard
to
the
reply
,
provide
on
behalf
of
the
government
,
to
some
of
the
point
they
make
.
on
the
same
date
Ireland
ratify
the
1995
additional
protocol
to
the
European
social
Charter
,
which
provide
for
a
system
of
collective
complaint
.
while
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
have
not
be
incorporate
into
domestic
law
,
the
substance
of
a
number
of
the
rights
contain
in
the
covenant
be
protect
by
the
constitution
and
by
legislation
.
although
not
cognisable
by
the
court
,
article
45
of
the
Constitution
set
out
directive
principle
of
social
policy
for
the
general
guidance
of
the
Legislature
.
if
we
be
to
move
to
a
situation
,
and
I
make
a
genuine
point
,
whereby
this
legislation
be
incorporate
such
that
there
be
a
constitutional
referendum
,
we
must
be
cognisant
of
the
separation
of
power
between
the
executive
,
the
Judiciary
and
the
Legislature
on
point
of
law
which
might
come
forward
where
test
case
be
make
and
what
the
role
of
the
Legislature
would
be
thereafter
,
or
would
it
be
diminish
relative
to
the
Judiciary
.
I
make
this
point
in
a
very
genuine
way
.
I
know
deputy
Pringle
in
reply
to
the
debate
will
respond
to
this
.
the
government
aim
at
ensure
that
the
State
's
obligation
to
implement
the
covenant
in
Ireland
be
meet
through
policy
aim
at
improve
the
enjoyment
of
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
,
include
by
fight
persistent
poverty
and
social
exclusion
and
recognise
that
other
,
include
individual
,
family
and
many
organisation
and
body
,
have
important
responsibility
as
well
.
the
means
by
which
the
State
set
out
to
meet
its
obligation
in
this
area
be
through
the
allocation
of
resource
.
I
will
now
speak
about
human
rights
in
the
domestic
context
,
notably
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
in
Ireland
.
Ireland
have
ratify
the
instrument
refer
to
above
which
promote
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
.
since
we
last
review
by
the
UN
Committee
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
in
2002
,
Ireland
enjoy
a
period
of
unprecedented
economic
growth
,
follow
by
a
equally
acute
financial
crisis
,
result
,
as
we
know
,
in
a
international
bailout
package
and
more
than
five
year
of
tough
measure
.
social
transfer
be
use
to
mitigate
inequality
and
effort
be
make
to
ensure
a
minimum
core
content
of
rights
.
we
approach
be
not
to
apply
blanket
reduction
to
all
area
of
spending
,
but
rather
to
reform
expenditure
in
a
way
that
continue
to
protect
,
where
possible
,
we
society
's
most
vulnerable
people
to
the
great
extent
possible
within
we
available
resource
.
since
take
office
in
2011
,
the
government
have
be
determined
to
fulfil
the
mandate
give
to
we
by
the
Irish
people
to
repair
the
economy
and
public
finances
,
create
job
and
give
we
citizen
confidence
in
a
good
future
.
the
scale
of
the
economic
crisis
we
have
go
through
be
unprecedented
in
Ireland
's
history
.
difficult
decision
have
be
take
and
huge
sacrifice
have
be
make
by
the
Irish
people
,
but
this
have
not
be
in
vain
.
the
spring
economic
statement
confirm
the
path
that
have
be
take
be
the
right
one
.
as
we
now
plan
for
the
remainder
of
this
decade
,
we
citizen
have
every
reason
to
be
confident
and
hopeful
about
they
future
.
this
future
will
have
steady
,
stable
economic
growth
and
more
people
work
in
secure
and
sustainable
job
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
the
State
.
it
will
be
a
future
of
stable
public
finances
that
will
deliver
money
in
people
's
pocket
,
high
quality
public
service
and
strategic
investment
in
essential
infrastructure
throughout
the
country
.
this
hard
-
win
gain
require
protect
and
secure
and
build
on
they
for
the
future
be
the
priority
.
the
fact
clearly
show
the
policy
of
the
government
have
work
and
will
continue
to
work
in
the
year
ahead
.
we
economy
be
grow
at
the
fast
rate
in
Europe
,
by
4.8
%
in
2014
,
and
the
Department
be
forecasting
growth
of
4
%
this
year
.
steady
,
stable
economic
growth
of
3.75
%
on
average
be
forecast
for
the
remainder
of
the
decade
.
the
spring
economic
statement
be
part
of
a
much
broad
reform
of
the
budgetary
framework
.
the
next
in
this
new
framework
be
the
national
economic
dialogue
and
I
refer
specifically
-----
in
the
time
allocate
to
I
to
speak
on
the
Bill
I
be
provide
the
context
in
which
the
Bill
be
be
put
forward
.
on
the
point
make
by
deputy
Collins
,
let
I
say
a
national
economic
dialogue
will
take
place
in
July
.
this
will
wide
consultation
on
the
budget
with
key
stakeholder
and
will
fully
respect
the
role
of
the
government
and
the
Oireachtas
to
make
policy
.
deputy
Collins
will
have
a
opportunity
to
make
she
own
or
she
party
's
submission
to
the
dialogue
and
we
look
forward
to
the
idea
she
will
propose
in
the
process
.
let
I
remind
deputy
Collins
the
government
have
legislate
for
the
restoration
of
the
minimum
wage
-----
-----
and
we
have
take
thousand
of
worker
out
of
the
universal
social
charge
.
let
I
also
say
the
national
economic
dialogue
be
about
ensure
we
have
a
inform
and
mature
discussion
on
the
short
and
medium
-
term
priority
of
the
government
and
beyond
.
undoubtedly
,
in
recent
year
considerable
sacrifice
be
make
by
the
people
of
Ireland
and
it
pose
challenge
in
term
of
the
progressive
realisation
of
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
in
Ireland
in
line
with
the
covenant
before
we
now
.
however
,
as
I
have
state
,
we
be
already
see
the
fruit
of
we
labour
.
the
public
finances
be
under
control
with
the
deficit
fall
below
3
%
this
year
and
debt
level
be
set
to
move
down
towards
the
European
average
in
the
next
few
year
.
as
a
result
we
will
be
in
a
position
to
implement
another
expansionary
budget
this
year
and
every
year
out
to
2020
if
this
be
deem
prudent
and
appropriate
.
we
will
meet
we
medium
-
term
objective
of
a
balance
budget
in
structural
term
over
the
forecast
horizon
.
in
order
to
return
stability
to
the
public
finances
,
gross
vote
expenditure
be
reduce
from
its
peak
of
more
than
€
63
billion
in
2009
to
€
54
billion
in
2014
.
in
implement
expenditure
reduction
,
the
government
's
priority
have
be
to
protect
key
public
service
and
social
support
to
the
great
extent
possible
at
a
time
of
increase
demand
.
this
target
approach
have
mean
that
primary
social
welfare
rate
such
as
pension
have
be
fully
maintain
since
the
government
take
office
.
we
commitment
to
protect
society
's
most
vulnerable
be
illustrate
by
datum
publish
by
EUROSTAT
early
this
year
show
that
Ireland
's
system
of
social

and
redistribution
of
wealth
and
income
to
that
most
in
need
be
among
the
most
effective
in
Europe
at
reduce
the

-
risk
-
of
-
poverty
rate
.
budget
2015
mark
a
turning
point
when
expenditure
reduction
be
no
long
require
to
meet
we
fiscal
target
.
we
be
now
in
a
position
to
provide
target
increase
for
key
service
.
in
the
area
of
education
,
we
have
seek
from
the
beginning
to
protect
DEIS
expenditure
,
which
prioritise
the
educational
need
of
child
and
young
people
from
disadvantaged
area
.
in
2015
,
gross
vote
current
expenditure
across
the
key
sector
of
social
protection
,
health
and
education
will
amount
to
more
than
€
40
billion

person
in
Ireland
,
include
the
gender
Recognition
Bill
2014
and
the
Children
and
Family
Relationship
Act
2015
.
this
set
the
context
for
we
discussion
today
about
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
in
Ireland
.
the
International
Covenant
on
economic
,
social
and
cultural
Right
,
ICESCR
,
require
state
that
be
party
to
it
to
take
step
,
to
the
maximum
of
they
available
resource
,
to
achieve
progressively
the
full
realisation
of
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
.
the
concept
of
progressive
realisation
constitute
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
will
generally
not
be
possible
to
achieve
the
full
realisation
of
all
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
in
a
short
period
of
time
.
the
reference
to
resource
availability
reflect
a
recognition
that
the
realisation
of
this
rights
can
be
hamper
by
a
lack
of
resource
and
can
be
achieve
only
over
a
period
of
time
.
equally
,
it
mean
that
a
state
's
compliance
with
its
obligation
to
take
appropriate
measure
be
assess
in
light
of
the
resource
,
financial
and
otherwise
,
available
to
it
.
even
though
state
may
realise
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
progressively
,
they
must
also
take
immediate
action
,
irrespective
of
they
resource
,
in
five
area
:
elimination
of
discrimination
;
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
not
subject
to
progressive
realisation
;
obligation
to
"
take
step
"
;
non-retrogressive
measure
;
and
minimum
core
obligation
.
if
either
of
the
two
referenda
on
Friday
pass
,
it
will
be
the
first
time
that
a
proposal
for
constitutional
reform
put
forward
by
a
constitutional
convention
result
in
actual
constitutional
change
.
I
ask
the
House
to
reject
the
Bill
,
while
thank
Deputy
Pringle
and
Healy
for
put
it
forward
,
because
it
be
important
that
voice
be
give
to
a
Bill
that
seek
to
change
the
constitution
.
in
close
the
debate
,
I
have
hope
to
be
able
to
thank
contributor
for
a
well
think
-
out
debate
with
constructive
idea
and
some
exchange
of
view
across
the
floor
of
the
House
.
I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the
government
might
agree
to
take
the
Bill
on
board
and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
could
have
be
put
into
the
constitution
.
I
would
have
expect
the
Labour
Party
,
in
particular
,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock
-
out
,
the
1916
Rising
and
the
democratic
programme
of
the
first
Dáil
.
give
the
view
of
that
party
's
founder
,
James
Connolly
and
Jim
Larkin
,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour
Party
would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the
constitution
.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at
random
will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its
own
member
.
it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
who
propose
a
similar
Bill
in
2000
,
as
well
as
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kevin
Humphrey
,
who
have
a
Bill
similar
to
this
on
the
Order
Paper
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
's
speech
be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four
and
a
half
year
.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low
and
middle
-
income
family
have
be
carry
the
brunt
of
the
recession
while
very
wealthy
people
have
increase
they
income
and
asset
during
the
recession
and
the
term
of
the
current
government
.
recently
,
the
Sunday

tell
we
that
the
250
rich
people

€
73.4

which
be
something
like
30

a

that
the

I
that

there
be
thousand
of
people
on

in

that
figure
have
increase
since

some
400000

there
be

almost
2

high
than
the

.
this
people
be

a

it
be
no

that
the

,
which
include
the

,
do
not
feel

put
economic

view
of
that
party
's

James

,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour
Party
would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the

.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at
random
will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its

.
it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí

,
who
propose
a

in

,
as
well
as
to
the

who
have
a

similar
to
this
on

the

be
effectively
a

of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four

a

.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low

middle

family
have
be
carry

while
very
wealthy
people
have
increase

this

be

it
be
no

that

do
not

I
have
even

the

on

I

would

this

it
be
no

that

do
not

economic

when
it
have
preside

there
be
a

,
particularly
among

the

which
promote

I

in

a
well

out
debate
with

and
some
exchange
of

across

of

I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the

might
agree
to
take

start
the

whereby
economic

I
would
have
expect
the
Labour

,
in

,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock

out
,
the
1916

the

give
the
view
of
that
party
's

,
James

Jim

,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour
Party
would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights

.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at

will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour

's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its

it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí

,
who
propose
a

,
as
well
as
to
the
Minister

,
who
have
a
Bill
similar
to
this
on
the
Order

.
the
Minister
of

be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four

a

.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low

middle

family

be
carry

have

the

it
be
a

to

,
as

to

the

be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the

have
preside
in
the
last
four

a

.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low

middle

income
family

be
carry

while
very
wealthy
people
have
increase

be
something

30

a

of

before
that
,
the
Sunday
Independent
tell
we
the

we

from

that
the

not

,
the

tell
I
that
the
high

10000

some

this
people
be
bail
out

a

.
it
be
no
wonder
that
the
government
,
which
include
the
Labour

,
do
not
feel
able
to
put
economic
,
social

cultural
rights
into

when
it
have
preside
over
a
situation
of
immense
social

there
be
a
huge

,
particularly
among

the
various

promote

basic

I
commend

in

I
have
hope
to
be

a
well

out
debate
with

and
some
exchange
of

I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the

might
agree
to
take

on

and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic

I
would
have
expect
the
Labour

,
in

,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as

I
would
have
think
that
at

the
Labour

would
have
be
prepare

,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no

that
the
conduct
of
the

of
the
Minister

in

have
be
deplorable

I
have
rarely

the

give
no
justification
for
he
opposition

.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the

.
it
be
a
insult
to
the

of
the
constitutional

who
give
they
time

energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various

I
commend
the
Bill
to
the
House
.
in
close
the
debate
,
I
have
hope
to
be
able
to
thank
contributor
for
a
well
think
-
out
debate
with
constructive
idea
and
some
exchange
of
view
across
the
floor
of
the
House
.
I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the
government
might
agree
to
take
the
Bill
on
board
and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
could
have
be
put
into
the
constitution
.
I
would
have
expect
the
Labour
Party
,
in
particular
,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock
-
out
,
the
1916
Rising
and
the
democratic
programme
of
the
first
Dáil
.
give
the
view
of
that
party
's
founder
,
James
Connolly
and
Jim
Larkin
,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour
Party
would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the
constitution
.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at
random
will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its
own
member
.
it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí
Quinn
,
who
propose
a
similar
Bill
in
2000
,
as
well
as
to
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Kevin

,
who
have
a
Bill
similar
to
this
on
the
Order
Paper
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
's
speech
be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four
and
a
half
year
.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low
and
middle

income
family
have
be
carry
the
brunt
of
the
recession
while
very
wealthy
people
have
increase

it

a
couple
of
week
before
that
,
the
Sunday
Independent
tell
we
the
rich
300
people
in
Ireland
have
a

we
know
from
the
Central

the
official

statistic
,
that
the
financial
asset
of
the
wealthy
people
in
society
be
now
high
than
they
be
at
the
height
of
the

.
not
so
long
ago
,
the
minister
for
Finance
tell
I
that
the
high

10000

side

340000

almost
2

high
than
the

this
people
be
bail
out
the

a

.
it
be
no
wonder
that
the
government
,
which
include
the
Labour
Party
,
do
not
feel
able
to
put
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
into
the
constitution
when
it
have
preside
over
a
situation
of
immense
social
dislocation
.
there
be
a
huge
sense
of
disappointment
,
particularly
among
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
and
the
various
non-governmental
organisation
which
promote
the
idea
of
put
this
basic
rights
into

constitution

I
commend
the
Bill
to
the

.
in
close
the
debate
,
I
have
hope
to
be
able
to
thank
contributor
for
a
well
think
-
out
debate
with
constructive
idea
and
some
exchange
of
view
across
the
floor
of
the

.
I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that
the
government
might
agree
to
take
the
Bill
on
board
and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic
,
social
and
cultural
rights
could
have
be
put
into
the

.
I
would
have
expect
the
Labour
Party
,
in
particular
,
would
have
take
the
opportunity
of
the
various
centenary
celebration
,
such
as
the
1913
lock
-
out
,
the
1916
Rising
and
the
democratic
programme
of
the
first
Dáil
.
give
the
view
of
that
party
's
founder
,
James
Connolly
and
Jim
Larkin
,
I
would
have
think
that
at
least
the
Labour
Party
would
have
be
prepare
to
start
the
process
,
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the
constitution
.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at
random
will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its
own
member
.
it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí

,
who
propose
a
similar
Bill
in

,
as
well
as
to
the
Minister
of

,
deputy
Kevin

,
who
have
a
Bill
similar
to
this
on
the
Order

.
the
Minister

be
effectively
a
justification
of
the
inequality
over
which
the
government
have
preside
in
the
last
four
and
a
half

.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low

middle

family

much
mistaken
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Sherlock
,
in
particular
,
have
be
deplorable
.
I
have
rarely
if
ever
see
such
a
display
of
arrogance
.
the
Minister
of
State
give
no
justification
for
he
opposition
to
the
Bill
.
he
speak
for
28
minute
about
background
and
so
on
and
speak
for
about
two
minute
on
the
Bill
.
it
be
a
insult
to
the
member
of
the
constitutional
Convention
who
give
they
time
,
energy
and
weekend
to
discuss
various
constitutional
option
,
include
this
one
.
they
decide
by
a
85
%
majority
to
start
the
process
of
put
this
rights
into
the
constitution
.
the
66
citizen
member
choose
at

will
be
particularly
disappointed
that
the
time
and
energy
they
have
give
have
effectively
be
cast
aside
in
such
a
arrogant
manner
.
the
Labour
Party
's
position
be
also
a
insult
to
its

.
it
be
a
insult
to
deputy
Ruairí

,
who
propose
a

,
as
well
as
to
the

of
the
inequality
over
which
the

have
preside
in
the
last
four
and
a

.
it
be
worth
repeat
that
low

middle

income
family
have
be
carry
the
brunt
of
the
recession
while
very
wealthy
people
have
increase

recently

the

that
the

€
73.4

which
be
something

30

a

this
people
be

it
be
no

that

do
not

I
commend

in

I
have

some

I
have
even
harbour
the
possibility
that

on

and
start
the
procedure
whereby
economic

I
would

would

in

,
various
expert
opinion
in
,
or
close
to
,
the
Central
Bank
be
forecasting
the
demise
of
the
Irish
credit
union
movement
.
this
expert
opinion
prove
to
be
well
wide
of
the
mark
.
only
four
credit
union
out
of
well
over
400
at
the
time
,
less
than
1
%
,
have
be
resolve
since
then
.
the
credit
union
sector
have
work
hard
at
build
up
reserve
which
be
the
envy
of
every
banking
institution
in
Europe
.
the
Irish
credit
union
sector
be
the
most
heavily
reserve
financial
sector
.
much
mention
be
make
of
the
commission
on
credit
union
.
to
be
fair
to
the
government
,
its
establishment
be
one
of
the
first
promise
on
which
it
deliver
.
the
commission
's
report
,
deliver
in
March
2012
,
be
a
comprehensive
and
balance
way
forward
.
it
seek
a
balance
of
measure
to
secure
the
future
of
credit
union
.
it
pain
I
,
however
,
to
say
the
commission
's
report
be
be
implement
in
a
selective
and
unbalanced
manner
,
cause
distress
to
the
sector
and
undo
many
of
the
positive
of
the
report
.
the
one
size
fit
all
regulatory
regime
be
propose
by
the
Central
Bank
in
Consultation
Paper
88
,
otherwise
know
as
CP88
,
be
a
exercise
in
suppressive
regulation
and
micro-management
,
in
which
it
propose
to
effectively
manage
the
very
same
credit
union
it
be
suppose
to
be
regulate
on
a
dispassionate
basis
.
sure
,
the
Central
Bank
consult
,
and
when
it
meet
with
unanimous
rejection
from
every
organisation
,
body
and
credit
union
in
the
sector
it
decide
to
go
ahead
regardless
.
this
be
consistent
with
a
pattern
that
be
now
well
establish
.
we
Central
Bank
have
the
most
extensive
power
of
any
regulatory
body
in
Europe
when
it
come
to
regulate
credit
union
and
yet
it
want
more
.
I
urge
review
and
caution
here
.
I
be
aware
of
credit
union
that
have
not
be
allow
to
hold
agm
for
two
,
four
or
more
year
but
the
credit
Union
Act
be
very
clear
.
section
78
(
4
)
state
the
bank
may
direct
the
credit
union
to
"
postpone
,
for
a
period
not
exceed
nine
month
,
the
hold
of
the
annual
general
meeting
of
the
credit
union
in
respect
of
the
financial
year
specify
in
the
direction
.
"
there
be
question
to
be
answer
as
to
why
exist
power
be
be
apply
in
this
way
.
remember
,
credit
union
be
the
member
's
union
,
and
member
have
the
right
to
know
what
be
go
on
.
very
legitimate
concern
have
be
raise
by
credit
union
in
recent
day
.
they
say
that
under
exist
regulation
they
effort
to
introduce
debit
card
be
be
frustrate
at
every
turn
by
the
regulatory
regime
.
even
the
most
basic
,
risk
free
,
prepay
debit
card
be
be
turn
down
.
now
,
the
regulator
want
to
limit
inflow
of
savings
and
loan
type
.
what
hope
have
we
of
develop
a
viable
third
force
capable
of
compete
with
the
banking
sector
?
the
lending
restriction
place
on
credit
union
by
this
self
-
same
regulator
have
do
profound
commercial
damage
.
it
be
commercially
naive
of
the
Central
Bank
to
think
it
can
switch
off
lending
for
four
year
and
not
damage
credit
union
and
they
credibility
in
the
local
market
.
this
be
not
a
wise
use
of
power
,
and
be
a
further
indicator
that
the
regulator
should
not
become
involved
in
the
day
to
day
run
of
the
body
they
regulate
.
will
the
Ceann
Comhairle
allow
I
another
ten
second
?
I
thank
deputy
Mulherin
and
I
appreciate
it
.
it
would
be
remiss
of
I
not
to
comment
on
the
government
's
very
welcome
initiative
on
microlending
.
let
we
be
honest
,
this
be
the
business
of
credit
union
.
they
have
be
restrict
from
operate
in
this
area
by
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
's
prudential
lending
circular
of
February
2013
.
this
circular
and
the
way
it
be
interpret
by
regulatory
inspector
will
make
it
impossible
for
the
new
scheme
to
be
a
success
.
credit
union
have
invest
in
compliance
and
in
improve
they
governance
arrangement
and
internal
control
.
that
structure
must
now
be
fund
because
they
come
with
additional
cost
.
the
reality
be
that
credit
union
need
to
be
give
the
tool
to
allow
they
to
compete
in
the
Ireland
of
2015
and
to
justify
the
cost
involve
in
comply
with
that
regulatory
structure
.
New
business
opportunity
,
product
and
service
be
not
be
sanction
.
not
a
single
new
credit
union
product
or
service
have
be
sanction
by
the
registrar
in
recent
year
.
credit
union
must
be
allow
to
lend
sensibly
.
of
course
they
lending
have
to
be
prudent
.
the
restriction
that
be
currently
in
place
be
simply
ridiculous
.
last
night
,
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
make
great
play
of
the
fact
that
credit
union
can
now
apply
for
a
review
of
they
lending
restriction
.
I
assure
the
House
that
the
review
process
be
extremely
onerous
and
expensive
and
involve
a
huge
amount
of
work
by
the
internal
auditor
of
the
credit
union
.
I
will
ask
a
fundamental
question
in
this
context
.
why
do
they
have
to
apply
?
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
have
be
crawl
all
over
Irish
credit
union
in
recent
year
.
there
have
be
on
-
site
inspection
.
they
have
be
through
the
book
upside
down
and
inside
out
.
credit
union
be
be
put
to
the
trouble
,
hassle
and
expense
of
make
formal
application
to
have
they
lending
restriction
review
.
that
should
be
do
as
part
of
the
normal
regulation
of
credit
union
.
the
minister
should
take
that
point
up
with
they
.
when
the
minister
speak
about
the
credit
Union
Advisory
Committee
last
night
,
he
do
not
mention
that
it
be
a
statutory
committee
that
have
to
be
establish
in
law
.
equally
,
he
do
not
mention
that
there
be
no
representative
of
the
credit
union
movement
on
the
advisory
committee
.
that
be
a
joke
and
should
be
amend
immediately
.
the
advisory
committee
's
term
of
reference
be
very
narrow
.
it
be
not
look
at
fundamental
issue
like
the
overall
business
model
,
the
need
to
modernise
the
structure
and
the
appropriateness
of
the
regulation
that
credit
union
be
face
.
why
have
some
credit
union
not
be
allow
to
hold
annual
general
meeting
for
four
year
?
if
the
issue
in
the
credit
union
be
so
serious
,
the
Registrar
of
credit
Union
should
come
out
and
say
so
,
base
on
the
level
of
work
it
have
do
to
date
.
why
be
credit
union
be
leave
in
the
dark
?
as
I
say
last
night
,
the
healthy
credit
union
be
not
be
tell
that
they
be
healthy
and
that
they
should
continue
to
do
what
they
be
do
.
equally
,
credit
union
with
problem
be
not
be
tell
what
that
problem
be
and
how
they
can
be
fix
.
this
be
not
acceptable
.
while
the
situation
be
quite
bad
,
it
will
get
much
bad
if
the
measure
propose
in
consultation
paper
88
be
implement
.
neither
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
nor
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
refer
to
the
consultation
paper
.
I
understand
that
the
registrar
and
the
minister
be
about
to
sign
off
on
the
propose
measure
.
I
will
give
a
example
of
the
profound
implication
that
such
a
move
would
have
.
the
proposal
in
consultation
paper
88
to
cap
at
€
100000
the
amount
of
savings
that
a
credit
union
member
can
hold
would
affect
55
%
of
credit
union
.
I
accept
that
it
would
affect
a
small
number
of
member
,
but
it
would
affect
over
half
of
credit
union
.
if
this
proposal
be
adopt
,
and
credit
union
be
confine
to
hold
a
level
of
savings
underpin
by
the
deposit
guarantee
scheme
,
it
will
send
a
negative
and
toxic
signal
that
the
registrar
and
the
government
have
no
confidence
in
credit
union
and
will
thereby
do
enormous
damage
to
the
credit
union
movement
.
if
the
minister
and
the
government
want
to
help
credit
union
,
they
should
press
the
pause
button
right
now
.
consultation
paper
88
should
not
be
sign
off
.
a
working
group
involve
representative
of
the
industry
should
be
initiate
immediately
to
examine
the
appropriateness
of
the
regulatory
structure
at
this
time
.
I
be
in
favour
of
bring
it
to
the
Joint
Committee
on
Finance
,
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
but
this
should
not
be
do
after
the
horse
have
bolt
.
if
this
measure
be
sign
into
law
by
the
minister
for
Finance
,
we
be
head
for
deep
trouble
.
I
would
like
to
conclude
by
ask
a
fundamental
question
.
do
this
government
want
to
be
the
government
that
preside
over
the
gradual
demise
of
the
credit
union
movement
?
I
be
sure
it
do
not
.
for
that
reason
,
this
should
be
a
watershed
moment
and
a
turning
point
.
if
this
motion
have
achieve
anything
,
it
have
put
the
future
of
the
credit
union
movement
firmly
on
the
political
agenda
.
I
ask
the
government
to
have
a
fresh
look
at
the
whole
thing
because
the
current
approach
be
not
work
.

commend

.
if
this
measure
be
sign
into
law
by
the
minister
for
Finance
,
we
be
head
for
deep
trouble
.
I
would
like
to
conclude
by
ask
a
fundamental
question
.
do
this
government
want
to
be
the
government
that
preside
over
the
gradual
demise
of
the
credit
union
movement
?
I
be
sure
it
do
not
.
for
that
reason
,
this
should
be
a
watershed
moment
and
a
turning
point
.
if
this
motion
have
achieve
anything
,
it
have
put
the
future
of
the
credit
union
movement
firmly
on
the
political
agenda
.
I
ask
the
government
to
have
a
fresh
look
at
the
whole
thing
because
the
current
approach
be
not
work
.
change
need
to
be
make
quickly
.
I
commend
the
motion
to
the
House
.
the
deputy
be
fight
on
two
front
.
deputy
Wallace
be
spend
too
much
time
in
Dublin
.
I
thank
all
the
Deputy
who
have
contribute
.
I
do
not
agree
with
some
of
the
comment
but
I
accept
that
people
be
make
contribution
in
a
spirit
of
try
to
impact
on
what
the
outcome
of
the
White
Paper
will
look
like
.
I
will
do
what
I
can
to
take
on
board
as
many
suggestion
as
possible
that
we
have
hear
.
I
will
not
go
through
each
suggestion
because
if
I
do
that
I
would
only
get
through
two
or
three
.
we
have
write
down
some
the
individual
comment
and
we
will
try
to
look
at
they
in
the
context
of
the
overall
paper
.
I
will
,
however
,
make
a
few
general
comment
because
I
suspect
some
Defence
force
personnel
may
be
watch
this
debate
.
I
regard
be
a
Irish
soldier
as
one
of
the
most
significant
form
of
patriotism
that
be
leave
in
term
of
serve
the
State
.
this
be
a
White
Paper
of
which
Defence
force
personnel
,
whether
reservist
or
permanent
Defence
Force
personnel
,
should
be
proud
and
in
which
they
should
see
a
future
for
themselves
and
they
career
as
member
of
the
Defence
Force
in
Ireland
.
they
should
view
with
pride
the
contribution
they
will
make
to
they
country
,
its
security
and
that
of
its
people
.
the
Defence
Force
be
a
hugely
important
part
of
we
national
infrastructure
.
they
would
be
the
last
line
of
defence
if
thing
be
to
take
a
significant
unexpected
negative
turn
,
which
may
happen
at
some
stage
in
the
future
and
which
we
cannot
predict
.
my
role
be
to
put
in
place
a
White
Paper
that
try
to
anticipate
all
future
risk
,
within
reason
,
and
to
try
to
put
together
a
infrastructure
involve
human
resource
,
equipment
,
knowledge
,
training
and
the
skillset
that
can
respond
to
the
list
of
threat
that
change
every
year
.
a
lot
of
the
commentary
in
the
debate
have
refer
to
how
quickly
some
of
the
threat
be
change
.
to
all
permanent
Defence
Force
personnel
,
I
say
that
we
want
you
to
be
proud
of
who
you
be
and
the
career
you
have
choose
.
I
hope
that
you
will
see
,
like
so
many
other
in
the
public
sector
,
the
reward
for
the
sacrifice
you
have
make
in
recent
year
in
response
to
a
financial
crisis
in
this
country
as
we
see
improve
working
condition
and
pay
.
I
also
thank
that
personnel
for
they
commitment
and
loyalty
for
stay
in
the
Defence
Force
through
that
period
and
for
facilitate
the
reform
which
be
not
simply
a
cost
-
save
measure
but
a
reconfiguration
of
the
Defence
Force
to
ensure
we
get
the
maximum
effect
in
term
of
output
for
the
country
from
a
strength
of
9500
personnel
.
I
want
to
explore
some
new
opportunity
in
this
White
Paper
.
I
want
to
create
a
platform
for
international
education
and
understanding
of
peacekeeping
and
conflict
resolution
and
I
want
we
to
give
leadership
in
area
such
as
gender
-
base
violence
,
in
which
Ireland
have
some
credibility
,
and
other
skillset
in
which
we
have
prove
we
worth
in
international
peacekeeping
operation
,
particularly
in
place
like
the
Middle
East
and
Africa
.
we
have
the
capacity
to
build
a
international
piece
of
infrastructure
of
real
value
to
the
Unite
Nation
and
to
we
European
partner
.
I
also
think
we
can
do
more
in
term
of
corporate
social
responsibility
to
reach
out
to
young
people
who
have
be
fail
by
the
State
and
who
may
be
enter
a
permanent
state
of
disadvantage
in
they
life
.
the
Defence
Force
may
be
able
to
transform
a
life
by
reach
out
to
such
people
.
we
have
look
at
international
good
practice
to
learn
what
might
work
in
Ireland
and
I
look
forward
to
explore
that
concept
with
other
in
this
House
when
we
publish
the
White
Paper
.
there
must
be
a
sense
of
value
,
recognition
,
pride
and
self
-
esteem
from
be
a
member
of
the
Defence
Force
when
a
person
leave
,
as
well
as
when
he
or
she
be
there
.
for
this
reason
there
be
some
very
strong
statement
in
the
White
Paper
around
veteran
's
policy
.
it
be
totally
unacceptable
that
a
person
who
be
injure
severely
in
the
line
of
duty
may
have
to
go
to
court
to
secure
a
significant
compensation
package
.
we
be
look
at
put
new
structure
in
place
which
be
far
less
adversarial
and
which
recognise
the
respect
we
should
have
for
the
Defence
Force
,
for
the
work
they
do
and
the
risk
they
take
.
all
this
will
require
a
budget
which
will
necessitate
a
incremental
increase
over
time
,
and
we
be
commit
to
a
ten
-
year
period
for
this
.
I
recognise
the
constraint
my
colleague
,
the
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Howlin
,
and
he
Department
be
under
at
the
moment
and
we
be
realist
about
this
,
but
we
also
want
to
ensure
defence
be
part
of
the
medium
and
long
-
term
financial
planning
of
the
country
.
the
security
and
defence
of
the
State
be
not
just
about
soldier
and
defence
.
it
be
also
about
planning
and
management
across
Department
,
involve
foreign
affair
,
justice
,
transportation
and
the
Office
of
the
Taoiseach
,
in
order
that
we
can
have
a
defence
and
security
policy
for
Ireland
in
the
future
that
be
fit
for
purpose
in
the
modern
world
.
I
thank
everyone
for
they
contribution
and
we
will
do
we
good
to
accommodate
the
contribution
that
be
helpful
.
government
policy
on
neutrality
be
settle
and
this
be
reflect
in
the
recent
policy
document
that
come
from
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
.
we
do
not
propose
to
change
that
but
will
reinforce
it
in
the
White
Paper
by
the
maintenance
of
the
triple
lock
in
we
approach
towards
neutrality
.
this
do
not
mean
stay
out
of
trouble
all
the
time
.
it
mean
Ireland
be
independent
to
choose
what
we
do
and
what
we
do
not
do
in
term
of
international
peacekeeping
and
peace
support
.
that
be
what
we
will
continue
to
do
with
the
triple
of
lock
.
I
thank
that
work
in
the
House
for
facilitate
we
in
stay
here
for
a
extra
20

.
I

the
deputy
mention
a
figure
of
4409
.
I
just
have
a
brief
chance
to
analyse
some
of
the
figure
.
a
figure
of
3066
be
related
to
ophthalmology
,
for
instance
.
this
be
a
significant
number
.
if
one
parse
out
ent
,
one
get
a
figure
of
approximately
556
,
assume
that
the
figure
I
have
be
right
up
to
date
.
with
regard
to
gastroenterology
,
breast
surgery
and
general
surgery
,
the
figure
seem
to
be
a
bit
more
manageable
.
further
investigation
be
definitely
need
into
why
the
vast
bulk
of
that
on
the
list
be
associate
with
ophthalmology
,
for
instance
.
we
must
determine
where
the
lag
be
in
this
regard
.
I
assume
the
administrator
in
the
HSE
and
hospital
group
be
watch
this
debate
.
I
do
know
that
they
tune
into
this
debate
.
I
would
be
very
surprised
if
they
be
not
in
a
position
to
provide
the
deputy
with
a
actual
breakdown
of
the
figure
and
where
the
time
lag
be
be
generate
across
the
discipline
.
certainly
,
the
matter
have
now
be
raise
on
the
record
of
the
House
.
I
could
tell
the
deputy
that
I
will
raise
it
directly
with
the
minister
,
deputy
Varadkar
,
but
the
facility
exist
for
deputy
Aylward
to
do
it
himself
.
the
matter
be
on
the
record
of
the
House
.
I
apologise
for
he
absence
.
it
be
significant
that
a
significant
figure
be
attributable
to
one
particular
discipline
.
that
need
to
be
interrogate
closely
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
raise
this
matter
.
it
be
raise
during
leader
's
question
by
deputy
Aengus
Ó
Snodaigh
when
the
Tánaiste
and
Minister
for
social
Protection
,
deputy
Joan
Burton
,
respond
to
he
query
.
I
have
be
supply
with
a
response
on
behalf
of
the
minister
for
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
,
deputy
Alan
Kelly
,
who
be
unavailable
.
I
should
say
at
the
outset
that
it
be
not
inconceivable
that
minister
be
unable
to
take
this
debate
in
the
House
from
time
to
time
.
the
deputy
,
as
a
former
minister
of
State
,
should
-----
I
mention
the
fact
that
this
issue
be
raise
on
the
Order
of
Business
merely
to
make
the
point
that
it
be
a
matter
that
be
before
the
House
already
today
not
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
,
with
all
due
respect
,
to
make
a
political
point
.
I
be
just
say
it
be
raise
by
Dublin
Deputy
and
be
state
that
for
the
record
.
if
you
will
grant
I
some
leniency
on
time
,
I
agree
absolutely
that
minister
should
be
present
,
but
a
further
charge
be
make
by
the
deputy
in
respect
of
the
relax
or
control
of
building
regulation
.
I
cannot
answer
for
that
charge
as
it
have
be
raise
here
as
a
adjournment
issue
.
perhaps
the
minister
should
answer
that
for
himself
but
,
nonetheless
,
the
charge
be
make
.
I
understand
that
Dublin
Fire
Brigade
have
no
plan
to
evacuate
resident
from
they
home
and
intend
,
rather
,
to
serve
a
enforcement
notice
require
that
a
schedule
of
work
be
carry
out
to
ensure
a
acceptable
level
of
fire
safety
provision
be
achieve
at
the
development
.
I
preface
my
further
remark
by
say
this
be
the
script
I
have
be
give
to
deliver
.
if
some
development
have
take
place
in
the
past
hour
or
so
,
a
Cheann
Comhairle
,
I
be
not
aware
of
that
.
the
issue
which
have
emerge
in
Longboat
Quay
be
a
matter
for
the
Dublin
Docklands
Development
Authority
,
the
receiver
to
the
developer
,
resident
of
Longboat
Quay
and
they
management
company
as
well
as
Dublin
Fire
Brigade
to
resolve
collaboratively
.
I
cannot
answer
for
the
charge
that
have
be
make
by
the
deputy
in
respect
of
the
Dublin
Docklands
Development
Authority
.
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
understand
that
all
party
be
actively
engage
to
find
a
resolution
to
the
situation
that
have
arise
.
while
Dublin
Fire
Brigade
have
be
proactively
engage
with
all
concerned
for
several
month
it
cannot
wait
indefinitely
for
matter
to
be
resolve
and
have
,
accordingly
,
this
week
signal
its
intention
to
serve
a
enforcement
notice
.
I
do
not
know
if
event
today
have
overtake
that
.
local
authority
have
extensive
power
of
inspection
and
enforcement
under
the
Fire
Safety
Act
1981
,
the
Building
Control
Act
1990
and
the
Planning
and
Development
Act
,
all
of
which
may
be
relevant
in
relation
to
fire
safety
arrangement
in
residential
development
.
compliance
with
the
statutory
requirement
in
regard
to
a
building
be
,
first
and
foremost
,
a
matter
for
the
owner
,
designer
and
builder
concerned
.
a
charge
have
be
make
here
against
the
architect
and
the
designer
.
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
have
no
function
in
assess
or
check
compliance
,
or
otherwise
,
of
specific
work
or
development
,
nor
can
the
Department
or
the
Minister
,
deputy
Alan
Kelly
,
influence
or
interfere
in
the
handling
of
specific
case
by
local
authority
who
be
at
all
time
independent
in
the
use
of
they
statutory
power
.
the
minister
have
a
role
in
ensure
that
adequate
arrangement
be
in
place
to
avoid
the
recurrence
of
such
problem
elsewhere
.
in
this
regard
a
number
of
legislative
reform
have
be
put
in
place
since
the
Longboat
Quay
development
be
build
which
greatly
strengthen
the
arrangement
in
place
for
the
regulation
and
oversight
of
such
development
.
the
statutory
registration
of
key
construction
professional
under
the
Building
Control
Act
2007
mean
that
such
professional
may
now
be
subject
to
professional
conduct
proceedings
where
instance
of
professional
misconduct
or
poor
professional
performance
arise
-
ultimately
this
may
lead
to
removal
from
the
statutory
register
which
would
affect
the
professional
's
ability
to
earn
they
livelihood
.
Building
control
regulation
be
amend
to
require
on
and
from
1
March
2014
great
accountability
in
regard
to
compliance
with
building
regulation
in
the
form
of
statutory
certification
of
design
and
construction
by
register
construction
professional
and
the
multi
-
unit
Development
Act
2011
further
require
developer
to
supply
a
certificate
of
compliance
with
fire
safety
from
a
register
construction
professional
in
each
such
development
.
it
be
also
worth
note
that
the
minister
,
deputy
Alan
Kelly
,
in
the
interest
of
support
owner
and
resident
live
in
development
where
concern
regard
compliance
with
fire
safety
arise
,
recently
announce
a
review
by
a
independent
fire
safety
expert
to
develop
a
framework
for
general
application
in
such
situation
.
this
review
will
outline
general
advice
and
guidance
which
can
be
use
by
owner
-
resident
and
they
professional
adviser
,
to
ensure
that
a
adequate
level
of
safety
be
in
place
for
person
in
and
about
they
development
.
this
may
include
make
provision
for
appropriate
or
enhance
fire
detection
and
alarm
measure
;
check
that
appropriate
escape
route
from
the
premise
be
available
,
design
in
accordance
with
current
standard
;
and
ensure
evacuation
plan
be
rehearse
in
each
premise
in
the
event
of
a
fire
incident
.
the
review
be
be
overseen
by
a
steering
group
comprise
of
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
and
local
authority
representative
under
the
chair
of
Mr.
Martin
Riordan
,
former
manager
of
Cork
County
Council
.
the
steering
group
will
prepare
its
report
by
31
January
2016
.
may
I
conclude
by
say
I
do
not
want
to
give
political
platitude
to
anybody
.
I
do
not
know
what
it
be
like
and
I
cannot
imagine
what
it
be
like
for
the
resident
of
Longboat
Quay
except
to
say
that
there
be
widespread
sympathy
for
the
plight
in
which
they
find
themselves
at
this
time
.
have
the
deputy
a
suggestion
?
the
point
be
make
.
if
I
interpret
the
deputy
correctly
,
there
be
a
suggestion
that
the
DDDA
should
act
in
respect
of
the
common
area-----
-----
the
entire
development
-
and
that
the
€
2
million
outstanding
should
be
obtain
from
the
ddda
or
,
the
deputy
be
say
,
vicariously
from
the
minister
.
in
other
word
,
effectively
the
government
should
pay
the
€
2
million
.
if
I
interpret
the
deputy
correctly
,
that
be
essentially
what
she
be
suggest
.
for
clarity
and
in
the
interest
of
the
record
of
the
House
,
I
be
not
fully
across
this
issue
but
perhaps
the
deputy
could
clarify
if
that
be
what
she
be
seek
?
so
that
be
the
deputy
's
position
and
that
will
be
refer
to
the
minister
in
question
.
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Education

I
think
.
I
note
the

comment
and
the
quote
from
Mr.
Ashe
.
I
reiterate
that
what
the
deputy
have
say
be
now
on

record
and
I
be
hopeful

this
from
Fianna
Fáil
.
yesterday
,
the
government
demonstrate
the
seriousness
of
we
commitment
to
international
development
as
a
core
element
of
Ireland
's
foreign
policy
.
have
stabilise
funding
for
the
Irish
Aid
programme
over
the
past
four
very
difficult
year
,
we
have
now
provide
for
the
first
substantial
increase
in
official
development
assistance
in
seven
year
.
it
be
hugely
significant
that
we
be
provide
€640
million
for
development
assistance
in
2016
,
a
increase
of
€
40
million
or
7
%
on
2015
.
just
three
week
ago
,
I
be
part
of
the
Irish
delegation
at
the
UN
summit
,
also
attend
by
the
Minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
Charles
Flanagan
,
which
adopt
a
new
set
of
sustainable
development
goal
which
will
guide
international
policy
and
action
up
to
2030
.
the
aim
be
nothing
less
than
to
eradicate
extreme
poverty
and
hunger
over
the
next
15
year
.
Ireland
play
a
lead
role
in
develop
the
new
global
development
framework
and
we
be
commit
to
maintain
we
strong
role
in
achieve
its
objective
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
thank
the
Irish
ambassador
,
David
Donoghue
,
and
he
colleague
in
New
York
for
they
wonderful
work
in
achieve
that
agenda
.
we
be
very
conscious
that
we
make
this
commitment
in
the
context
of
progress
under
the
millennium
development
goal
but
we
also
recognise
current
setback
as
a
result
of
the
unprecedented
level
of
humanitarian
cris
and
suffering
across
the
Middle
East
and
Africa
,
which
have
create
the
appalling
refugee
crisis
in
the
Mediterranean
region
.
this
budget
be
a
vitally
important
signal
internationally
that
we
will
reverse
the
slide
in
the
percentage
of
we
GNP
which
we
provide
in
aid
.
we
expect
that
there
will
be
a
small
but
significant
increase
in
the
percentage
,
from
a
estimate
0.35
%
in
2015
to
0.36
%
.
we
know
it
be
modest
but
we
be
commit
to
make
progress
towards
the
UN
target
of
0.7
%
and
to
do
so
in
a
sustainable
and
effective
manner
.
Ireland
play
a
central
role
in
broker
agreement
among
the
EU
development
minister
in
May
to
recommit
to
the
target
and
to
reach
it
,
collectively
,
by
2030
.
I
visit
Jordan
last
week
to
see
for
myself
the
extent
of
the
refugee
crisis
as
a
result
of
the
conflict
in
Syria
.
we
be
fully
aware
of
the
burden
be
borne
by
neighbour
country
,
especially
Jordan
,
Lebanon
and
Syria
.
I
be
move
and
impressed
by
the
generosity
of
the
Jordanian
government
and
its
people
,
even
as
they
economy
be
squeeze
by
instability
and
conflict
on
they
border
,
in
provide
for
they
neighbour
in
they
time
of
need
.
Jordan
,
a
country
the
size
of
Ireland
with
a
population
of
6.3
million
,
many
of
they
refugee
themselves
,
be
now
host
some
1.3
million
Syrian
refugee
in
camp
and
in
the
community
.
the
challenge
for
Jordan
and
for
the
refugee
family
I
meet
be
immense
.
I
be
convinced
that
Ireland
and
we
EU
partner
can
do
more
to
assist
they
.
over
the
past
three
year
,
Ireland
have
provide
over
€300
million
to
address
humanitarian
cris
worldwide
.
this
include
over
€
100
million
for
the
Middle
East
and
the
Horn
of
Africa
,
over
€
40
million
of
which
have
be
for
victim
of
the
Syrian
conflict
.
we
have
not
forget
the
victim
of
other
humanitarian
cris
in
Europe
's
broad
neighbourhood
,
in
South
Sudan
,
Central
African
Republic
and
the
Sahel
.
we
have
also
deploy
we
naval
personnel
to
the
Mediterranean
to
rescue
people
drive
to
attempt
the
crossing
in
unseaworthy
boat
.
with
the
resource
provide
for
ODA
in
2016
,
we
will
do
more
.
I
be
determined
that
we
will
increase
we
direct
humanitarian
funding
for
the
refugee
crisis
,
which
be
a
crisis
for
Europe
also
.
Ireland
can
play
a
lead
role
in
a
comprehensive
European
response
,
address
the
immediate
need
of
the
victim
of
the
crisis
and
its
root
cause
in
poverty
,
underdevelopment
,
conflict
and
climate
change
.
we
will
review
all
aspect
of
we
aid
programme
to
ensure
that
the
Irish
people
's
funding
have
maximum
impact
for
vulnerable
community
.
I
want
to
ensure
that
we
will
use
we
humanitarian
aid
and
we
long
-
term
development
aid
,
especially
in
we
key
partner
country
,
in
a
more
co-ordinate
way
.
we
objective
will
be
to
respond
to
the
immediate
humanitarian
suffering
and
to
build
the
resilience
of
endangered
community
against
future
cris
.
we
will
work
closely
with
we
key
partner
country
,
with
the
Unite
Nation
and
with
we
ngo
to
do
so
.
I
take
this
opportunity
to
pay
tribute
to
the
Irish
ngo
and
we
multilateral
partner
who
be
work
so
hard
in
they
respective
field
to
deliver
on
the
global
development
agenda
.
the

the
government
be
strongly
commit
to
Ireland
's
overseas
aid
programme
and
to
its
place
at
the
heart
of
we
foreign
policy
.
''
one
World
,
one
Future
''
,
we
policy
for
international
development
,
clearly
articulate
the
government
's
commitment
to
the
UN
target
of
provide
0.7
%
of
GNP
for
official
development
assistance
,
ODA
.
this
commitment
be
reiterate
by
the
Taoiseach
at
the
UN
Summit
in
New
York
in
September
which
adopt
a
new
set
of
sustainable
development
goal
to
guide
international
development
policy
and
action
for
the
next
15
year
.
we
track
record
in
support
of
Ireland
's
aid
programme
be
clear
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
protect
and
stabilise
budget
allocation
at
a
time
of
extraordinary
economic
difficulty
.
in
that
time
,
we
have
provide
over
€
3
billion
for
ODA
.
we
have
state
that
we
would
make
progress
towards
the
0.7
%
target
,
once
economic
condition
allow
.
now
,
as
we
economic
recovery
gain
momentum
and
become
more
widely
establish
,
we
can
begin
to
make
good
on
that
commitment
.
on
budget
day
,
the
government
announce
the
first
substantial
increase
in
the
aid
budget
in
over
seven
year
.
for
2016
,
we
have
provide
a
total
of
over
€
640
million
in
ODA
,
a
increase
of
€
40
million
or
almost
7
%
on
the
2015
level
.
we
estimate
this
will
entail
a
small
increase
in
we
oda
-
GNP
percentage
from
a
project
0.35
%
in
2015
to
a
project
0.36
%
in
2016
,
so
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
.
the
challenge
now
be
to
ensure
Ireland
continue
to
play
a
lead
role
in
the
comprehensive
response
to
the
unprecedented
humanitarian
cris
throughout
the
globe
,
especially
in
Europe
's
broad
neighbourhood
,
while
ensure
we
aid
programme
remain
effective
in
address
the
root
cause
of
poverty
and
hunger
.
we
continue
to
maintain
a
very
strong
relationship
with
the
ngo
,
which
be
partly
fund
by
the
taxpayer
through
Irish
Aid
.
the
issue
the
UN
and
the
multilateral
organisation
be
try
to
grapple
with
at
present
be
the
major
challenge
of
how
,
globally
,
government
be
go
to
be
able
to
fund
the
commitment
into
the
future
.
to
answer
the
deputy
's
question
,
one
of
the
issue
we
be
now
look
at
be
that
of
how
we
manage
the
dynamic
between
long
-
term
development
goal
,
such
as
the
eradication
of
poverty
and
hunger
,
and
the
numerous
humanitarian
cris
that
be
break
out
,
for
example
,
in
the
Mediterranean
,
as
well
as
how
we
manage
the
interoperability
between
long
-
term
development
goal
and
humanitarian
cris
.
there
be
also
the
question
of
how
we
leverage
the
opportunity
within
the
global
private
sector
.
the
private
sector
have
a
role
to
play
and
,
within
the
Department
,
we
be
try
to
get
a
great
degree
of
traction
in
that
relationship
which
go
beyond
mere
corporate
social
responsibility
.
at
the
multilateral
level
,
through
the
UN
and
other
organisation
,
Ireland
have
a
important
role
to
play
.
we
would
openly
encourage
organisation
to
interact
with
each
other
.
we
would
really
like
to
see
a
great
degree
of
consolidation
of
effort
and
we
do
not
want
to
see
any
duplication
of
effort
.
Irish
Aid
have
a
track
record
,
through
its
relationship
with
organisation
like
GOAL
,
of
provide
the
seed
funding
that
then
allow
goal
to
leverage
the
opportunity
,
such
as
in
its
response
in
Syria
.
if
we
can
encourage
a
great
degree
of
that
kind
of
leverage
effort
and
bring
in
the
private
sector
,
as
I
say
,
beyond
mere
corporate
social
responsibility
,
then
I
believe
that
pitch
Ireland
onto
a
great
global
stage
.
we
advocate
that
policy
and
we
be
work
towards
try
to
get
a
great
degree
of
traction
in
that
regard
.
I
thank
the
Tánaiste
for
share
she
time
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Flanagan
will
set
out
to
the
House
the
development
regard
the
all
-
party
talk
in
Belfast
in
which
he
and
I
have
be
involve
over
the
past
several
week
.
beyond
the
talk
,
the
work
to
deliver
a
reconcile
and
peaceful
Northern
Ireland
as
part
of
a
prosperous
and
inclusive
island
of
Ireland
continue
every
day
across
government
.
nowhere
be
this
more
evident
than
in
we
work
to
promote
and
develop
North
-
South
co-operation
.
through
this
work
,
we
be
build
the
lasting
relationship
between
North
and
South
which
will
help
to
copperfasten
peace
and
stability
and
deliver
prosperity
for
all
we
people
.
the
success
of
North
-
South
body
like
Tourism
Ireland
and
InterTradeIreland
demonstrate
what
can
be
achieve
when
we
pool
we
resource
in
key
strategic
area
.
Building
on
this
success
be
now
we
focus
.
in
line
with
the
Stormont
House
agreement
,
a
report
on
new
economically
-
focus
priority
be
bring
to
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
this
year
.
priority
area
of
co-operation
for
the
government
include
high
level
education
,
agri-food
,
energy
,
climate
change
,
creative
industry
,
sport
and
other
joint
initiative
.
the
overarching
aim
be
to
ensure
the
most
effective
use
of
scarce
public
fund
on
both
side
of
the
border
to
promote
economic
growth
and
create
job
in
all
we
community
.
the
government
's
commitment
to
North
-
South
economic
co-operation
therefore
remain
a
priority
.
as
the
Taoiseach
have
state
,
the
recently
announce
infrastructure
and
capital
investment
plan
have
a
dedicated
section
on
North
-
South
infrastructure
.
in
the
Stormont
House
agreement
,
the
government
agree
to
a
financial
package
to
support
North
-
South
work
programme
as
well
as
measure
to
promote
reconciliation
and
INTERREG
programme
,
include
the
concept
of
the
Narrow
Water
Bridge
project
and
develop
the
Ulster
canal
.
in
this
agreement
,
we
also
reaffirm
we
commitment
to
provide
£
25
million
in
2015
and
2016
to
the
A5
project
.
this
be
the
source
of
some
discussion
in
Stormont
as
late
as
yesterday
.
research
and
innovation
,
one
of
the
key
driver
of
economic
growth
and
employment
,
have
be
a
key
area
for
North
-
South
co-operation
.
for
instance
,
the
development
of
the
North
West
Regional
Science
Park
,
co-locate
in
Derry
and
Letterkenny
,
have
deliver
new
hub
for
the
development
of
innovative
business
,
create
job
and
strengthen
the
cross-border
link
which
be
so
vital
to
the
economic
development
of
the
Border
region
.
there
have
be
very
good
progress
to
date
in
term
of
North
-
South
collaboration
under
the
EU'
€
80
billion
research
and
innovation
Horizon
2020
programme
,
which
be
negotiate
during
the
Irish
Presidency
.
the
first
year
have
deliver
over
€
19
million
of
EU
funding
to
support
North
-
South
project
.
we
need
now
to
build
on
the
excellent
collaborative
progress
to
date
and
to
work
on
we
allied
strength
in
area
such
as
ICT
,
health
and
agri-food
research
to
create
and
deliver
more
successful
partnership
project
.
the
expansion
of
Science
Foundation
Ireland
's
remit
to
fund
researcher
in
the
North
will
enable
further
work
together
on
a
all
-
island
basis
and
will
create
a
further
leverage
opportunity
.
North
-
South
co-operation
also
bring
real
day
-
to
-
day
benefit
to
people
on
both
side
of
the
Border
.
for
example
,
when
open
next
summer
,
the
£
50
million
radiotherapy
unit
at
Derry
's
Altnagelvin
Hospital
will
provide
access
to
radiotherapy
service
to
over
a
half
million
people
across
the
north

west
region
,
share
service

this
co-operation
also
extend
to
the
field
of
sport
.
as
one
rugby
World
Cup
end
,
we
look
forward
to
2023
when
,
hopefully
,
Ireland
will
be
host
this
great
tournament
on
a
all
-
island
basis
.
this
joint
North
-
South
bid
have
tremendous
potential
to
drive
tourism
.
speak
personally
,
I
be
hopeful
that
all
of
the
stadia
will
be
ready
when
the
time
come
.
I
refer
to
Páirc
Uí
Chaoimh
in
that
respect
.
it
be
clear
that
North
-
South
co-operation
be
crucial
and
indeed
a
central
plank
of
the
good
Friday
agreement
.
I
hope
we
continue
to
fulfil
we
obligation
both
North
and
South
in
respect
of
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
.
I
welcome
the
announcement
by
the
Taoiseach
of
a
date
for
Armagh
.
it
be
important
all
political
persuasion
would
sign
up
to
that
and
that
the
executive
in
all
its
form
would
ensure
that
we
continue
to
give
that
the
energy
it
deserve
.
the
current
political
difficulty
should
not
get
in
the
way
of
vitally
important
North
-
South
co-operation
.
now
that
DUP
minister
have
return
to
they
desk
in
Stormont
,
I
hope
the
North
-
South
ministerial
Council
can
resume
its
work
,
which
have
deliver
so
much
benefit
for
citizen
across
the
island
.
whatever
the
difficulty
,
this
government
will
continue
to
work
to
support
North
-
South
cooperation
and
to
help
unlock
the
full
potential
of
the
island
society
and
economy
.
it
be
the
death
of
Jonathan
Corrie
that
bring
the
issue
of
housing
and
homelessness
onto
the
Dáil
agenda
in
a
stark
way
.
it
be
alarming
and
disturbing
that
it
take
another
terrible
tragedy
at
Carrickmines
,
for
the
Lynch
,
Gilbert
and
Connors
family
and
for
the
wide
Traveller
community
,
to
bring
about
a
debate
on
Traveller
issue
in
the

we
be
aware
of
the
statistic
which
show
the
inequality
experience
by
member
of
the
Traveller
community
in
term
of
life
expectancy
,
illness
,
rate
of
suicide
and
infant
mortality
.
we
be
also
aware
of
the
inequality
in
education
.
in
that
regard
,
I
ask
Traveller
parent
to
be
more
proactive
and
supportive
of
they
child
continue
in
school
beyond
leave
certificate
into

I
teach

often

bright
Traveller

we
have
become
complacent

have
ignore
the
glaring
inequality
that
persist

what
be
common
at

be

on
a
point
of
order
,
and
I
be
not
make
a
political
point
here
,
I
be
conscious
of
how
much
time
be
leave
on
the
clock
in
this
debate
and
I
be
anxious
to
be
able
to
contribute
.
we
have
time
.
I
thank
the
Leas
-
Cheann
Comhairle
.
I
be
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
statement
so
far
.
I
have
listen
with
interest
to
the
debate
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
agreement
be
entitle
a
Fresh
start
.
the
agreement
be
not
a
final
destination
but
represent
a
step
forward
towards
normalise
politics
and
society
in
Northern
Ireland
.
I
share
the
articulation
of
the
disappointment
on
the
issue
around
legacy
.
as
a
result
of
where
I
be
and
where
my
generation
be
in
relation
to
the
legacy
issue
,
we
bear
a
certain
responsibility
for
deal
with
the
past
.
be
it
go
to
take
another
generation
,
or
a
generation
beyond
that
?
when
I
look
at
the
pupil
and
student
who
be
here
as
visitor
today
,
I
wonder
whether
we
will
have
to
wait
for
someone
of
they
generation
to
finally
crack
the
legacy
issue
and
to
deal
with
the
past
.
Successive
Irish
government
,
regardless
of
they
political
persuasion
,
have
seek
to
lean
in
towards
the
British
government
on
this
issue
in
a
forceful
and
genuine
manner
.
if
we
be
go
to
talk
about
it
in
a
rhetorical
way
,
it
be
important
for
all
of
we
-
from
a
party
political
point
of
view
-
to
be
honest
with
each
other
about
just
what
that
will
mean
in
real
term
.
it
will
involve
the
British
Government
and
people
from
other
party
political
perspective
open
up
the
closet
and
see
where
the
skeleton
be
,
and
if
we
be
honest
with
ourselves
,
we
will
admit
that
it
be
incumbent
on
we
all
to
look
deeply
at
just
what
the
issue
of
disclosure
and
national
security
mean
.
be
they
use
as
mere
word
to
protect
entity
against
the
let
in
of
the
light
?
there
have
be
much
mention
in
this
chamber
of
the
campaign
that
be
be
run
by
U2
.
it
would
appear
that
many
member
of
this
House
have
be
at
the
U2
concert
that
have
take
place
in
recent
day
,
at
which
there
have
be
a
particular
articulation
in
relation
to
the
Dublin
and
Monaghan
bombing
.
I
can
say
in
good
stead
with
a
degree
of
integrity
that
this
and
previous
government
have
consistently
seek
to
ensure
the
mandate
give
by
this
House
on
the
issue
of
disclosure
in
this
regard
be
fulfil
.
we
will
continue
to
do
that
.
the
agreement
be
incomplete
if
we
always
have
to
come
back
to
the
legacy
issue
and
the
need
to
deal
with
the
past
.
it
seem
to
be
a
iterative
process
on
this
island
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
ageist
when
I
say
that
my
generation
fail
to
understand
why
this
issue
cannot
be
surmount
.
we
need
to
deal
with
they
assuredly
.
we
need
to
ensure
we
speak
for
the
victim
.
if
we
can
get
beyond
this
issue
,
we
can
achieve
a
great
degree
of
transparency
.
when
I
talk
to
ordinary
citizen
in
the
six
County
of
the
North
,
it
do
not
appear
to
I
that
they
be
as
engage
as
they
might
be
with
the
issue
at
Stormont
.
the
constant
cry
I
hear
from
ordinary
people
of
all
persuasion
be
"
they
need
to
get
on
with
it
up
on
the
hill
"
.
that
be
what
people
seem
to
want
.
they
want
normal
,
normative
politics
and
a
real
economy
.
every
government
need
to
move
towards
assist
and
facilitate
that
,
and
cajole
for
it
,
in
every
possible
way
.
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
North
-
South
co-operation
,
I
can
say
we
have
make
a
real
commitment
in
the
form
of
the
additional
£
25
million
that
be
be
provide
for
the
A5
project
.
it
be
important
that
we
unlock
the
potential
of
the
north
west
of
this
island
.
it
could
be
argue
that
there
be
a
disparity
in
growth
and
economic
prosperity
between
the
region
to
the
east
and
the
west
of
the
River
Bann
.
we
need
to
do
more
to
unlock
the
potential
of
the
north
west
,
particularly
the
Donegal
-
Derry
region
.
that
be
what
we
be
work
towards
.
as
a
minister
of
State
with
a
economic
Ministry
,
it
be
no
harm
for
I
to
say
on
the
record
of
this
House
that
my
colleague
and
I
recently
visit
the
Bombardier
facility
in
Belfast
.
two
company
from
the
South
of
Ireland
-
Dawnlough
from
Galway
and
Takumi
from
Limerick
-
be
sub-
supply
part
and
component
for
the
aerospace
and
aeronautical
industry
into
Bombardier
.
that
be
the
island
or
the
Ireland
that
I
want
to
see
.
I
want
big
company
like
Bombardier
,
which
be
a
significant
player
in
the
global
aerospace
industry
,
to
source
they
material
from
as
near
as
possible
,
and
preferably
on
the
island
of
Ireland
.
such
a
approach
will
sustain
job
in
the
North
and
the
South
,
sustain
a
real
economy
and
really
knit
the
two
part
of
this
island
together
in
the
way
that
need
to
happen
.
it
will
allow
we
to
move
beyond
some
of
the
empty
rhetoric
that
be
sometimes
employ
when
we
talk
about
the
North
,
the
South
or
North
-
South
co-operation
.
as
I
have
say
,
we
feel
that
this
be
a
iterative
process
.
we
feel
strongly
that
the
legacy
issue
remain
outstanding
.
we
feel
a
obligation
to
the
family
,
the
victim
and
that
people
who
want
to
deal
with
the
past
in
a
transparent
way
.
we
will
continue
to
feel
that
way
and
I
believe
that
who
step
into
the
breach
long
after
people
like
I
cease
to
inhabit
position
of
this
nature
will
continue
to
do
so
.
at
what
point
do
we
ask
ourselves
certain
question
?
do
a
certain
number
of
generation
have
to
pass
while
people
seek
justice
before
this
matter
be
forget
and
write
out
of
history
?
at
what
point
in
the
next
number
of
year
can
we
get
beyond
this
issue
or
deal
with
it
in
a
substantive
way
?
as
long
as
it
be
not
deal
with
,
it
will
continue
to
cast
a
shadow
over
everything
we
be
do
to
try
to
bring
about
the
normalisation
of
society
and
,
as
have
be
say
here
,
move
towards
a
society
that
be
beyond
conflict
.
I
want
to
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
first
Minister
,
Peter
Robinson
,
and
the
deputy
first
Minister
,
Martin
McGuinness
.
I
want
to
say
in
a
personal
way
that
they
be
tough
negotiator
and
formidable
politician
.
I
would
say
that
when
it
come
to
hammer
out
a
deal
on
real
economy
,
the
restoration
of
normal
politics
and
the
restoration
of
the
institution
,
they
have
the
good
interest
of
the
people
of
the
North
at
heart
.
there
be
still
many
flaw
and
issue
that
need
to
be
deal
with
,
however
.
I
be
not
go
to
critique
people
in
another
part
of
this
island
,
in
the
context
of
my
vision
for
a
great
degree
of
traction
on
the
issue
that
be
still
outstanding
,
other
than
to
say
that
this
deal
offer
the
potential
for
realpolitik
to
reign
supreme
within
the
Stormont
institution
.
it
have
to
be
record
for
historical
purpose
-
I
be
think
of
the
future
historian
who
will
parse
through
this
debate
-
that
the
issue
of
welfare
legislation
will
now
pass
to
Westminster
for
this
period
.
that
be
a
fact
.
I
will
conclude
by
respond
to
that
who
have
speak
about
sister
party
.
I
have
never
witness
a
debate
that
feature
so
many
reference
to
Westminster
,
George
Osborne
and
the
Tories
.
to
be
honest
,
maybe
it
be
time
for
we
to
look
at
the
abstentionist
policy
.
maybe
there
be
a
forum
-----
this
be
Dáil
Éireann
.
person
have
receive
a
mandate
for
Westminster
.
I
be
be
honest
about
this
.
the
deputy
can
criticise
I
all
they
like
.
I
be
not
say
that
people
need
to
take
they
seat
.
I
be
say
that
there
be
a
debate
to
be
have
in
London
as
well
.
we
need
to
be
honest
about
where
we
be
go
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party

to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of

be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of

union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,

and
congratulate
the
credit

throughout
the

for
the

to

that
up

credit

be
integral

we

we

early

Ferbane

which
be
the

.
I
hear

about
the

all
of
this
be
in

the

the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour

state
yesterday
that
the

will
have
very
little

.
regardless
of
the

,
he
call

.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my

and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's

.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior

from
the
Irish

of

ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine

and
the
Labour

,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face

for

we
suffer
the
political

of
put

.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the

after

still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future

of

be
at
risk
.
it
go
without

we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,

and

the

we

we

be

I

all

the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour

state
yesterday
that
the

will
have
very
little

.
regardless
of
the

,
he
call

.
this

personify
in
my

and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the

of
this
administration
's

.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of

,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine

and
the
Labour

,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face

for

,
when

.
we
suffer
the
political

of
put

.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into

and
take
it
from
there
.
the

and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
there
be
nothing
to
be
perceive
about
the
implication
for
the
credit
union
movement
.
what
be
factual
be
that
if
this
go
be
ahead
in
the
form
in
which
it
have
be
present
,
the
future
viability
of
credit
union
be
at
risk
.
it
go
without
say
we
all
acknowledge
,
compliment
,
thank
and
congratulate
the
credit
union
movement
throughout
the
country
for
the
work
,
help
and
assistance
it
give
to
community
,
to
such
a
extent
that
up
to
70
%
of
the
population
be
member
of
credit
union
.
in
my
county
,
there
be
35000
member
in
Tullamore
,
9000
in
Clara
and
up
to
50000
or
60000
throughout
the
county
.
credit
union
be
integral
and
vital
part
of
community
.
we
know
bank
be
withdraw
service
throughout
the
country
.
we
hear
deputy
Mulherin
speak
about
the
difference
between
the
atmosphere
in
a
credit
union
office
and
that
in
a
bank
office
.
we
see
interaction
,
vitality
and
engagement
in
a
credit
union
office
,
while
we
see
staff
in
bank
introduce
customer
to
machine
.
early
this
year
,
Ferbane
in
my
county
lose
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
the
last
bank
in
town
.
I
hear
deputy
Heydon
from
Kildare
speak
about
the
vacuum
be
create
by
the
loss
of
the
credit
union
in
Newbridge
over
the
past
two
year
.
he
should
inform
he
colleague
because
they
will
face
the
same
vacuum
in
they
community
in
the
come
year
if
what
be
propose
in
cp88
be
sign
by
the
minister
.
over
the
past
four
year
,
we
have
see
the
government
stand
idly
by
as
post
office
go
to
the
wall
.
we
have
see
Garda
station
close
and
social
welfare
office
withdraw
from
community
.
all
of
this
be
in
addition
to
the
threat
that
exist
that
the
loss
of
credit
union
will
take
away
whatever
bit
of
vitality
could
be
perceive
and
hold
in
community
.
we
have
see
no
effort
to
address
the
deficit
that
exist
in
many
town
and
village
and
no
overhaul
of
commercial
rate
or
dedicate
plan
for
town
and
village
.
like
many
of
he
colleague
in
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
recognise
the
value
of
credit
union
.
he
speak
of
the
government
's
amendment
to
the
motion
,
which
would
have
we
believe
it
address
the
concern
and
fear
be
reiterate
by
member
throughout
the
country
.
he
accept
,
of
course
,
the
commission
's
finding
in
they
entirety
and
the
independence
of
the
registrar
,
but
do
he
,
and
it
appear
that
he
do
,
accept
the
selective
implementation
of
the
registrar
's
various
recommendation
on
this
document
as
it
be
at
present
?
he
forget
,
and
do
not
acknowledge
,
the
omission
of
other
recommendation
which
might
assist
credit
union
in
help
and
assist
small
and
medium
-
size
enterprise
,
and
which
may
help
with
mortgage
lending
and
go
beyond
the
restrictive
10
%
cap
be
put
on
mortgage
for
more
than
25
year
.
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Harris
,
also
state
there
be
provision
in
the
amendment
,
and
I
also
hear
this
in
the
contribution
of
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
McHugh
,
for
the
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
input
from
the
credit
union
movement
with
regard
to
the
social
housing
dilemma
we
have
.
what
exploration
be
require
,
when
a
credit
union
have
the
capacity
to
make
available
through
a
central
fund
,
similar
to
the
Canadian
model
,
funding
to
local
community
and
local
authority
to
build
house
in
they
area
?
yesterday
,
I
be
at
a
meeting
at
which
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Community
and
local
Government
speak
about
the
estimate
and
look
back
at
the
spend
this
year
.
this
time
last
year
,
it
make
a
commitment
with
regard
to
a
€
4
billion
investment
over
five
year
,
whereby
there
would
be
7500
new
home
throughout
the
country
this
year
,
4000
of
which
would
be
new
build
.
the
number
that
be
build
be
200
,
which
be
five
per
local
authority
.
my
county
must
have
be
the
exception
because
it
get
eight
,
although
this
be
over
the
past
four
year
.
the
credit
union
movement
have
at
its
disposal
investment
capacity
in
this
sector
for
local
authority
and
even
a
return
of
2
%
would
be
far
in
excess
of
what
be
be
receive
in
the
bank
at
present
.
member
of
the
government
party
should
not
give
we
the
platitude
we
have
hear
.
I
will
be
honest
,
and
I
do
not
like
say
this
,
but
I
be
a
bit
worried
about
some
of
the
condescending
tone
I
hear
from
some
of
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
.
the
credit
union
movement
be
professional
and
forward
think
,
which
be
well
capable
-
and
more
than
capable
as
have
be
say
by
some
speaker
-
of
meet
the
demand
of
the
economy
as
we
know
they
.
it
be
much
more
capable
when
it
be
compare
to
the
way
in
which
the
bank
conduct
they
business
.
I
hear
deputy
Nolan
of
the
Labour
Party
state
yesterday
that
the
debate
will
have
very
little
effect
.
regardless
of
the
vote
,
he
call
for
more
engagement
.
this
sentiment
personify
in
my
mind
and
for
my
party
the
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
ramification
of
this
administration
's
governance
.
there
must
be
political
consequence
.
I
have
meet
representative
of
credit
union
over
the
past
number
of
month
,
include
a
senior
delegation
from
the
Irish
League
of
credit
Union
,
ILCU
,
last
week
,
and
I
speak
to
people
in
the
credit
Union
Development
Association
,
CUDA
,
as
well
.
it
become
quite
apparent
to
I
that
this
have
to
get
political
,
as
member
of
Fine
Gael
and
the
Labour
Party
,
as
the
government
,
need
to
accept
and
face
the
consequence
of
they
action
.
for
example
,
when
we
party
put
in
place
a
four
-
year
programme
to
close
the
gap
between
income
and
expenditure
,
it
suffer
the
political
consequence
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
current
government
continue
along
that
path
and
close
the
gap
by
the
final
third
necessary
.
that
be
to
the
government
party
's
benefit
but
,
more
importantly
,
it
be
to
the
country
's
benefit
.
we
suffer
the
political
consequence
of
put
that
in
place
,
rightly
or
wrongly
.
we
accept
the
decision
of
the
Irish
people
of
put
that
opposite
into
government
and
take
it
from
there
.
the
last
government
capitalise
Irish
bank
;
the
Irish
people
capitalise
they
.
this
government
tell
we
after
the
June
2012
summit
that
there
would
be
retrospective
bank
recapitalisation
,
as
there
should
have
be
,
but
we
doubt
it
be
the
game
changer
that
the
government
argue
it
be
.
it
be
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
agreement
.
instead
,
we
have
see
high
mortgage
interest
rate
,
2
%
above
the
European
average
,
with
a
bank
veto
on
solution
propose
by
customer
,
mass
eviction
,
no
social
dividend
from
NAMA
and
€
8
billion
of
credit
union
soft
deposit
sit
in
bank
ever
since
.
be
it
not
gas
to
think
that
,
have
be
save
by
the
Irish
people
,
bank
be
now
prop
up
by
the
credit
union
with
€
8
billion
of
investment
?
the
same
credit
union
be
barr
from
compete
in
the
way
they
can
and
should
in
the
market
.
it
be
time
for
the
member
of
Fine
Gael
to
face
up
to
the
political
consequence
of
they
action
.
it
be
time
for
that
party
member
to
realise
the
power
in
the
hand
of
the
minister
for
Finance
,
deputy
Noonan
,
with
respect
to
the
ramification
of
what
they
sign
and
when
they
sign
it
.
many
have
speak
of
how
,
early
today
,
representative
of
the
ILCU
,
CUDA
and
the
credit
Union
manager
's
Association
come
before
the
finance
committee
.
there
be
all
-
party
agreement
,
on
the
suggestion
of
deputy
Michael
McGrath
,
that
the
committee
should
meet
the
registrar
,
and
a
date
have
be
fix
for
16
December
.
the
committee
have
write
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
ask
he
to
withdraw
or
withhold
he
intention
to
sign
CP88
at
least
until
that
meeting
take
place
.
he
claim
he
have
pass
on
the
concern
about
the
perceive
implication
of
what
be
contain
within
it
to
the
registrar
in
recent
week
,
follow
he
meeting
with
representative
of
that
body
on
12
November
.
yet
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
have
agree
to
meet
representative
of
the
credit
union
again
tomorrow
.
that
come
after
hear
what
we
have
say
and
what
member
have
say
throughout
the
country
,
and
with
member
from
he
party
and
the
Labour
Party
remind
he
of
the
issue
.
in
the
likes
of
Offaly
there
be
50000
or
60000
credit
union
member
and
-
make
no
mistake
about
it
-
my
colleague
and
I
will
remind
each
and
every
one
about
the
ramification
and
political
consequence
arise
from
the
government
's
action
if
it
go
ahead
with
this
.
as
I
say
early
,
it
be
hide
behind
necessary
rectification
and
control
in
the
way
financial
institution
have
to
be
monitor
.
I
accept
that
.
there
be
scaremongering
from
the
minister
for
Finance
with
regard
to
credit
union
;
it
be
not
from
a
consultant
,
as
deputy
Rabbitte
argue
.
the
minister
for
Finance
for
this
State
say
it
would
take
up
to
€
1
billion
to
rectify
the
harm
that
might
exist
in
credit
union
,
but
it
take
only
€
40
million
.
the
government
think
it
can
hide
behind
regulator
and
registrar
while
say
it
accept
all
that
be
contain
in
the
commission
's
recommendation
.
it
will
stand
idly
by
when
the
registrar
selectively
choose
from
that
recommendation
and
put
that
under
the
nose
of
the
minister
for
Finance
.
at
this
eleventh
hour
,
he
still
think
there
be
"
perceive
"
ramification
,
but
there
be
nothing
perceive
about
we
put
a
second
motion
before
this
House
.
it
be
time
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
.
it
be
time
for
the
government
and
its
party
member
to
realise
that
if
they
vote
for
this
,
they
should
not
expect
member
of
credit
union
to
vote
for
they
.
the
deputy
be
display
a
nasty
streak
today
.
that
be
a
nasty
streak
come
out
.
it
be
unbecoming
of
the
deputy
.
it
be
be
deliver
.

I
thank
the
deputy
for
the
question
.
the
current
El
Niño
weather
event
be
one
of
the
strong
ever
measure
.
more
unpredictable
weather
condition

a
detrimental
effect
on
people
's
life
and
livelihood
across
Africa
,
particularly
in
the
Horn
of
Africa
and
the
great
Lake
region
.
in
the
next
six
month
humanitarian
need
will
increase
,
with
severe
drought
and
flooding
.
below
normal
rainfall
and
drought
condition
have
already
affect
part
of
Ethiopia
,
Sudan
,
Djibouti
and
Eritrea
,
reduce
agricultural
production
.
Excessive
rainfall

part
of
Ethiopia
,
Somalia
and
other
country
,
cause
severe
and
sustain
flooding
,
loss
of
livelihood
and

outbreak
.
Irish
Aid
,
the
government
's
overseas
development
assistance
programme
,
be
step
up
its
preparedness
to
respond
.
we
long
-
term
development
programme
in
country
such
as
Ethiopia
include
funding
for
a
large
social
protection
programme
for
the
most
vulnerable
household
.
we
be
also
scaling
up
humanitarian
response
to
reduce
the
impact
on
household
and
save
life
in
the
bad
affect
place
.
in
Ethiopia
alone
in
2015
,
Ireland
have
increase
its
bilateral
programme
to
nearly
€
28
million
in
response
to
the
humanitarian
crisis
.
we
be
provide
a
additional
€
1.8
million
in
humanitarian
assistance
through
non-governmental
organisation
,
ngo
,
partner
.
in
total
,
Ireland
have
provide
over
€
80
million
in
humanitarian
assistance
in
2015
and
this
budget
will
be
increase
to
over
€
100
million
for
2016
.
we
be
allocate
additional
resource
across
affect
country
to
support
programme
which
save
life
,
improve
food
security
,
protect
livelihood
and
build
the
resilience
of
people
to
withstand
the
effect
of
such
a
weather
event
across
Africa
.
we
will
continue
to
monitor
the
position
closely
and
scale
up
action
as
El
Niño
strengthen
and
condition
on
the
ground
wear
.
Ireland
's
bilateral
relationship
with
Ethiopia
be
very
strong
.
official
Ethiopian
government

for
January
2016
indicate
that
10.2

food
assistance
,
in

programme
.
Ireland
be
one
of
the
core
funder
of
the
programme
through
Irish
Aid
and
the
embassy
.
we
have
be
do
this
since
2005
.
there
be
financial
resource
require
to
deal
with
this
issue
.
this
be
the
third
large
humanitarian
emergency
globally
,
behind
that
in
Syria
and
Yemen
.
it
be
estimate
that
approximately
US
$
1.8
billion
be
require
to
cover
the
cost
of
emergency
intervention
.
we
will
continue
to
work
with
multilateral
partner
such
as
the
UN
agency
and
on
a
bilateral
basis
.
we

tripe
.
I
never
say
that
.
I
be
take
this
topical
issue
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
deputy
Paschal
Donohoe
,
who
apologis
for
be
unable
to
attend
this
afternoon
.
the
Exchequer
provide
funding
support
to
the
four
regional
airport
in
Donegal
,
Kerry
,
Waterford
and
Knock
under
the
regional
airport
programme
operate
by
the
Department
of
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
.
over
the
past
decade
,
Knock
have
receive
almost
€
21
million
in
Exchequer
support
in
operational
and
capital
grant
under
the
OPEX
and
Capex
funding
scheme
administer
by
the
Department
.
in
August
last
year
,
the
European
Commission
give
its
approval
for
the
Department
's
new
regional
airport
programme
,
which
take
account
of
the
recommendation
of
the
Knock
study
group
and
the
subsequent
decision
by
government
to
continue
funding
support
to
the
four
regional
airport
.
that
decision
recognise
that
the
regional
airport
should
be
give
the
opportunity
beyond
2014
to
grow
to
a
viable
,
self
-
sustain
position
,
particularly
consider
the
contribution
that
they
make
to
they
respective
regional
and
local
economy
.
this
be
also
acknowledge
in
the
new
national
aviation
policy
that
be
publish
last
August
.
the
deputy
will
be
aware
that
,
under
new
EU
state
aid
guideline
of
2014
,
the
maximum
level
of
aid
permissible
for
capital
project
at
airport
with
few
than
1
million
passenger
per
annum
be
75
%
.
the
EU
guideline
recognise
,
however
,
that
airport
in
this
category
may
face
difficulty
in
sourcing
the
balance
of
at
least
25
%
.
subject
to
a
case
-
by
-
case
assessment
,
a
aid
rate
in
excess
of
75
%
may
be
justify
in
exceptional
circumstance
.
in
such
a
scenario
,
the
commission
have
indicate
that
a
business
case
justify
any
propose
high
aid
rate
would
have
to
be
approve
by
it
and
must
be
able
to
demonstrate
the
airport
's
inability
to
proceed
with
the
propose
investment
at
the
75
%
aid
rate
.
under
a
new
aspect
of
the
regional
airport
programme
call
the
public
policy
remit
,
all
of
the
regional
airport
,
include
Knock
,
be
eligible
for
grant
assistance
up
to
90
%
towards
the
cost
of
capital
investment
in
the
area
of
safety
and
security
.
there
be
also
a
ppr
scheme
which
assist
with
grant
of
up
to
100
%
of
the
operational
cost
of
the
airport
in
this
two
area
.
last
year
,
under
the
first
year
of
the
new
programme
,
Knock
receive
almost
€
1.2
million
in
grant
support
from
the
Department
and
the
latter
have
already
begin
engage
again
with
all
four
airport
on
they
future
requirement
for
capital
grant
assistance
.
the
minister
be
,
of
course
,
aware
that
Knock
have
indicate
that
it
will
require
a
high
grant
rate
than
the
maximum
75
%
permit
under
the
EU
guideline
for
certain
major
capital
project
that
be
plan
at
the
airport
over
the
come
year
.
the
ongoing
engagement
with
Knock
continue
to
address
this
issue
,
as
well
as
the
funding
available
to
the
airport
under
the
new
ppr
scheme
.
I
note
the
point
the
deputy
have
make
.
I
do
not
have
a
answer
to
that
question
,
but
I
be
sure
departmental
official
and
the
minister
's
staff
be
watch
proceedings
and
I
be
sure
the
deputy
will
approach
the
minister
directly
on
this
issue
.
for
the
purpose
of
reply
,
I
will
reiterate
that
I
do
not
think
it
be
a
case
of
rule
out
the
possibility
of
90
%
funding
.
I
do
not
think
that
be
explicitly
state
in
the
answer
I
give
.
I
will
read
again
from
the
answer
:
the
minister
be
,
of
course
,
aware
that
Knock
have
indicate
that
it
will
require
a
high
grant
rate
than
the
maximum
75
%
permit
under
the
EU
guideline
for
certain
major
capital
project
that
be
plan
at
the
airport
over
the
come
year
.
the
ongoing
engagement
with
Knock
continue
to
address
this
issue
,
as
well
as
the
funding
available
to
the
airport
under
the
new
ppr
scheme
.
in
my
interpretation
of
the
answer
,
that
do
not
necessarily
rule
out
the
possibility
of
the
potential
for
90
%
funding
.
I
do
not
have
a-----
I
be
take
this
issue
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
,
deputy
Paschal
Donohoe
.
I
understand
that
deputy
Dowds
have
be
very
proactive
on
this
issue
for
quite
some
time
and
I
thank
he
for
raise
the
matter
.
I
understand
that
the
background
to
this
issue
arise
from
the
concern
of
local
resident
live
in
the
immediate
area
in
relation
to
the
use
of
surround
residential
road
by
heavy
goods
vehicle
and
they
wish
to
see
a
3.5
tonne
vehicle
weight
restriction
apply
to
Kennelsfort
Road
for
traffic
management
purpose
.
while
I
cannot
comment
on
the
specifics
of
any
weight
restriction
currently
apply
to
the
Kennelsfort
Road
,
decision
in
respect
of
the
application
of
such
weight
restriction
be
entirely
a
matter
for
the
relevant
local
authority
.
in
this
instance
,
and
base
on
the
intervention
of
deputy
Dowds
,
that
would
appear
to
be
South
Dublin
County
Council
,
though
my
script
state
it
be
Dublin
City
Council
.
the
minister
do
not
have
any
role
to
play
in
such
decision
.
however
,
should
South
Dublin
County
Council
decide
to
apply
such
a
weight
restriction
on
Kennelsfort
Road
,
this
would
be
indicate
by
the
use
of
the
appropriate
vehicle
weight
limit
sign
.
the
legislative
basis
underpin
the
erection
of
such
regulatory
signage
be
provide
for
under
road
traffic
legislation
with
which
all
local
authority
must
comply
.
also
,
further
detail
relate
to
regulatory
vehicle
weight
signage
be
set
out
for
local
authority

apply
to
all

,
include

,
which

.
any
decision
by
a
local
authority
to
apply
such
restriction
would
have
to
take
account
of
whether
the
road
in
question
be
use
as
part
of
a
bus
route
.
in
conclusion
,
individual
local
authority
be
well
place
to
assess
the
particular
local
vehicle
weight
requirement
,
base
on
either
road
safety
or
traffic
management
grounds
,
which
should
apply
to
a
particular
individual
road
.
however
,
as
previously
mention
,
if
such
weight
limit
control
be
apply
,
local
authority
must
erect
signage
that
be
in
full
compliance
with
regulation
.
the
enforcement
of
road
traffic
regulation
govern
vehicle
weight
limit
on
any
particular
public
road
be
a
matter
for
a
Garda
Síochána
.
how
do
I
respond
with
a
negative
after
that
?
the
deputy
have
raise
some
question
which
be
on
the
record
of
the
House
.
I
will
endeavour
to
speak
directly
to
the
minister
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
about
the
specific
question
pose
.
I
hope
official
in
the
minister
's
Department
be
listen
to
this
and
that
they
will
reply
directly
to
the
deputy
.
however
,
I
assure
the
deputy
that
I
will
raise
this
directly
with
the
minister
,
who
be
currently
in
the
Seanad
deal
with
the
Road
Traffic
Bill
.
I
acknowledge
the
great
work
of
deputy
Dowds
and
the
fastidious
and
meticulous
way
in
which
he
have
always
deal
with
issue
relate
to
he
constituent
.
we
all
hope
we
will
be
back
in
the
House
.
deputy
Dowds
have
make
a
outstanding
contribution
to
this
House
and
to
the
Parliamentary
Labour
Party
.
we
wish
he
the
good
on
he
next
path
in
life
,
whatever
pathway
that
be
.
I
have
already
say
this
.
I
have
examine
the
situation
around
the
country
and
be
shocked
by
what
I
find
.
what
I
be
say
be
nothing
new
.
there
have
be
a
60
%
increase
in
Waterford
,
where
up
to
504
people
be
homeless
.
last
week
I
make
the
point
on
radio
and
television
station
that
37
people
come
to
my
office
between
Monday
and
Wednesday
the
week
before
last
and
17
be
homeless
.
we
analyse
they
situation
.
I
would
not
overly
criticise
the
minister
.
he
have
compassion
and
do
not
want
people
to
be
homeless
.
the
situation
in
Waterford
be
replicate
around
the
country
.
a
mother
with
one
child
receive
a
payment
of
€475
.
one
could
not
rent
a
apartment
in
Waterford
for
€
475
,
never
mind
a
two
-
bedroom
house
.
more
and
more
single
mother
be
become
homeless
,
something
that
have
be
acknowledge
by
the
Society
of
St.

de
Paul
,
the
Samaritan
and
other
group
,
because
they
do
not
have
the
money
to
pay
for
rental
accommodation
.
there
be
a
argument
that
if
one
increase
rent
allowance
everything
else
will
go
up
in
price
.
the
amount
of
money
people
be
give
be
not
sustainable
,
base
on
the
fact
that
house
cannot
be
supply
immediately
for
they
.
they
have
no
choice
but
to
go
into
rental
accommodation
.
we
have
to
make
rental
accommodation
affordable
or
increase
payment
under
the
hap

.
I
know
the
situation
be
difficult
and
there
be
no
easy
fix
,
but
we
have
to
decide
on
do
one
or
the
other
.
a

of
the

population
be

mother
.
they

although
the

as
Minister

at

,
I
be
conscious
of
the
importance
of
cross-border
economic
and
social
co-operation
and
how
this
have
benefit
the

as
a

.
this

North

body
like

what
can

achieve
when

they
be

South
co-operation
also
bring
real
day
-
to
-
day
benefit
to
people
on
both
side
of
the
Border
.
I
know
from
my
own
experience
as
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
that
research
and
development
,
one
of
the
important
driver
of
economic
growth
and
employment
,
be
a
key
focus
for
North
-
South
co-operation
.
it
be
important
that
we
continue
to
encourage
and
support
this
valuable
area
for
EU
support
under
Horizon
2020
,
where
there
have
be
steady
progress
towards
meet
the
€
175
million
target
for

project
.
in
term
of
project
directly
support
by

,
the

to

have
recently
be
complete
with
clear
benefit
for
enhance
people
-
to
-
people
connectivity
between
both
part
of
the
island
.
as
we
have
hear
today
,
we
cannot
be
certain
that
nothing
will
change
with
the
Border
if
the
UK
vote
to
leave
the
EU
.
while
every
effort
would
be
make
to
minimise
any
impact
in
this
scenario
,
any
change
to
border
arrangement
have
the
potential
to
impact
on
this
type
of
co-operation
.
as
have
be
state
early
,
the
UK
be
Ireland
's
large
trading
partner
.
trade
between
Ireland
and
the
UK
run
at
€
1.2
billion
per
week
or
€
62
billion
per

,
with
a
broad
mix
of
goods
and

.
also
,
accord
to
a
Teagasc
report
,
Brexit
:
implication
for
the
Agri-
food
sector
,
publish
early
this
week
,
we
food
industry
represent
about
one
third
of
Ireland
's
total
merchandise
export
to
the
UK
,
leave
this
industry
particularly
concerned
about
a
UK
exit
from
the
European
Union
.
this
be
not
the
only
industry
that
have
concern
.
Successive
study
have
show
that
a
UK
departure
from
the
EU
will
have
a
adverse
impact
across
the
economy
,
both
in
the
UK
and
in
Ireland
.
we
have
already
hear
today
that
the
British
Treasury
state
early
this
week
that
the
UK
economy
will
be
"
permanently
poorer
"
in
any
scenario
where
it
leave
the
EU
.
anything
that
negatively
impact
on
the
level
of
trade
between
we
two
country
be
not
to
be
welcome
.
while
this
decision
be
for
the
people
of
the
Unite
Kingdom
,
there
be
no
doubt
that
a
vote
to
leave
would
have
a
significant
impact
on
we
here
in
Ireland
.
the
position
of
the
Irish
government
be
clear
:
we
want
the
UK
to
remain
part
of
the
EU
for
three
main
reason
,
namely
,
the
clear
economic
business
case
which
favour
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo
;
we
share
interest
in
sustain
stability
and
prosperity
in
Northern
Ireland
;
and
the
need
to
retain
the
UK
as
a
important
ally
in
the
EU
.
the
third
point
have
be
acknowledge
by
Member
across
this
House
today
during
this
debate
.
entirely
understandably
,
a
focus
of
many
intervention
in
this
debate
have
be
on
Ireland
's
preparedness
for
the
possibility
of
a
UK
decision
to
leave
the
EU
.
government
colleague
have
speak
on
this
issue
throughout
the
day
,
but
I
believe
it
be
useful
to
set
out
we
approach
.
if
the
vote
be
to
leave
the
EU
,
a
period
of
two
year
be
provide
for
under
the
EU
treaty
,
during
which
the
UK
's
exit
term
would
be
negotiate
.
although
negotiation
could
well
take
significantly
long
,
any
extension
would
need
to
be
agree
unanimously
by
the
remain
27
EU
member
state
.
Ireland
will
,
of
course
,
play
its
full
part
in
such
negotiation
.
the
Irish
government
will
continue
to
plan
for
any
contingency
so
that
we
be
prepared
to
deal
with
the
potential
consequence
in
the
event
of
a
UK
vote
to
leave
.
a
eventual
agreement
between
the
UK
and
the
EU
,
as
well
as
anything
possible
to
be
agree
between
ourselves
and
the
UK
,
use
the
bilateral
structure
the
Taoiseach
outline
at
the
outset
of
this
debate
,
would
determine
a
overall
framework
and
set
out
the
arrangement
across
many
sector
.
we
hope
that
on
24
June
,
we
will
be
welcoming
a
vote
to
remain
.
if
this
be
not
the
choice
of
the
UK
electorate
,
then
we
will
be
as
prepared
as
possible
across
all
of
government
to
manage
the
consequence
and
deal
with
the
uncertainty
that
arise
.
whatever
the
outcome
,
we
will
maintain
strong
,
positive
and
productive
relationship
with
both
the
EU
,
of
which
we
will
remain
a
member
state
as
well
as
remain
in
the
euro
,
and
with
the
UK
.
nine
week
remain
to
polling
day
.
I
urge
all
of
that
with
family
and
friend
live
in
the
UK
to
encourage
they
to
register
to
vote
,
to
remind
they
of
the
unique
perspective
Ireland
have
on
this
debate
,
and
to
ask
they
to
cast
they
vote
on
23

I
be
conscious
of
the
importance
of
cross-border
economic
and
social
co-operation
and
how
this
have
benefit
the

as
a
whole
.
this

what

they
be

a
considerable
contribution
towards

also
bring

I
know
from
my
own
experience
as
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
that

,
one
of
the
important

,
be
a
key
focus
for

it
be
important
that
we
continue
to
encourage
and
support
this
valuable
area
for

under
Horizon

,
where
there
have
be

as
we
have
hear
today
,
we
cannot
be
certain
that
nothing
will
change
with
the
Border
if
the
UK
vote
to
leave
the
EU
.
while
every
effort
would
be
make
to
minimise
any
impact
in
this
scenario
,
any
change
to
border
arrangement
have
the
potential
to
impact
on
this
type
of
co-operation
.
as
have
be
state
early
,
the
UK
be
Ireland
's
large
trading
partner
.
trade
between
Ireland
and
the
UK
run
at
€
1.2
billion
per
week
or
€
62
billion
per
annum
,
with
a
broad
mix
of
goods
and
service
.
also
,
accord
to
a
Teagasc
report
,
Brexit
:
implication
for
the
Agri-
food
sector
,
publish
early
this
week
,
we
food
industry
represent
about
one
third
of
Ireland
's
total
merchandise
export
to
the
UK
,
leave
this
industry
particularly
concerned
about
a
UK
exit
from
the
European
Union
.
this
be
not
the
only
industry
that
have
concern
.
Successive
study
have
show
that
a
UK
departure
from
the
EU
will
have
a
adverse
impact
across
the
economy
,
both
in
the
UK
and
in
Ireland
.
we
have
already
hear
today
that
the
British
Treasury
state
early
this
week
that
the
UK
economy
will
be
"
permanently
poorer
"
in
any
scenario
where
it
leave
the
EU
.
anything
that
negatively
impact
on
the
level
of
trade
between
we
two
country
be
not
to
be
welcome
.
while
this
decision
be
for
the
people
of
the
Unite
Kingdom
,
there
be
no
doubt
that
a
vote
to
leave
would
have
a
significant
impact
on
we
here
in
Ireland
.
the
position
of
the
Irish
government
be
clear
:
we
want
the
UK
to
remain
part
of
the
EU
for
three
main
reason
,
namely
,
the
clear
economic
business
case
which
favour
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo
;
we
share
interest
in
sustain
stability
and
prosperity
in
Northern
Ireland
;
and
the
need
to
retain
the
UK
as
a
important
ally
in
the
EU
.
the
third
point
have
be
acknowledge
by
Member
across
this
House
today
during
this
debate
.
entirely
understandably
,
a
focus
of
many
intervention
in
this
debate
have
be
on
Ireland
's
preparedness
for
the
possibility
of
a
UK
decision
to
leave
the
EU
.
government
colleague
have
speak
on
this
issue
throughout
the
day
,
but
I
believe
it
be
useful
to
set
out
we
approach
.
if
the
vote
be
to
leave
the
EU
,
a
period
of
two
year
be
provide
for
under
the
EU
treaty
,
during
which
the
UK
's
exit
term
would
be
negotiate
.
although
negotiation
could
well
take
significantly
long
,
any
extension
would
need
to
be
agree
unanimously
by
the
remain
27
EU
member
state
.
Ireland
will
,
of
course
,
play
its
full
part
in
such
negotiation
.
the
Irish
government
will
continue
to
plan
for
any
contingency
so
that
we
be
prepared
to
deal
with
the
potential
consequence
in
the
event
of
a
UK
vote
to
leave
.
a
eventual
agreement
between
the
UK
and
the
EU
,
as
well
as
anything
possible
to
be
agree
between
ourselves
and
the
UK
,
use
the
bilateral
structure
the
Taoiseach
outline
at
the
outset
of
this
debate
,
would
determine
a
overall
framework
and
set
out
the
arrangement
across
many
sector
.
we
hope
that
on
24
June
,
we
will
be
welcoming
a
vote
to
remain
.
if
this
be
not
the
choice
of
the
UK
electorate
,
then
we
will
be
as
prepared
as
possible
across
all
of
government
to
manage
the
consequence
and
deal
with
the
uncertainty
that
arise
.
whatever
the
outcome
,
we
will
maintain
strong
,
positive
and
productive
relationship
with
both
the
EU
,
of
which
we
will
remain
a
member
state
as
well
as
remain
in
the
euro
,
and
with
the
UK
.
nine
week
remain
to
polling
day
.
I
urge
all
of
that
with
family
and
friend
live
in
the
UK
to
encourage
they
to
register
to
vote
,
to
remind
they
of
the
unique
perspective
Ireland
have
on
this
debate
,
and
to
ask
they
to
cast
they
vote
on
23
June
,
when
voter
turnout
may
be
the
decide
factor
in
this
hugely
important
referendum
.
one
more
second
.
do
not
be
so
partisan
on
this
.
I
be
not
expect
to
get
the
opportunity
to
speak
so
I
appreciate
that
the
Ceann
Comhairle
have
fit
I
in
.
we
have
all
speak
about
Irish
Water
in
the
House
today
and
have
all
highlight
the
concern
and
issue
relate
to
it
.
deputy
present
be
very
familiar
with
my
constituency
,
the
Acting
Chairman
and
I
represent
it
.
they
will
also
be
aware
of
the
same
concern
relate
to
the
establishment
of
Irish
Water
,
the
way
it
be
do
and
whether
there
be
a
need
for
it
.
most
people
accept
that
it
be
unnecessary
at
the
time
and
that
local
authority
be
do
a
good
job
and
provide
the
service
.
the
one
resource
that
they
have
be
miss
over
the
last
number
of
year
by
successive
government
be
,
perhaps
,
funding
.
there
be
different
reason
for
this
,
be
they
economic
or
whatever
they
be
at
the
time
,
but
local
authority
in
general
,
whether
water
or
waste
water
management
,
do
a
good
job
,
deliver
the
service
and
improve
the
infrastructure
.
as
we
all
know
,
if
there
be
a
issue
with
a
person
's
water
service
or
waste
water
service
and
he
or
she
ring
Irish
Water
,
it
ring
the
local
authority
.
they
employ
the
same
staff
who
be
there
before
Irish
Water
be
set
up
to
go
out
,
assess
the
problem
and
contact
Irish
Water
about
the
issue
.
Irish
water
then
issue
they
a
purchase
order
or
order
number
to
go
out
and
carry
out
the
work
.
this
be
a
completely
inefficient
way
of
do
business
because
another
completely
unnecessary
layer
of
bureaucracy
be
be
introduce
.
the
local
authority
staff
,
who
have
the
local
expertise
,
carry
out
the
work
to
a
high
standard
and
deliver
a
excellent
service
all
across
my
constituency
and
the
country
generally
,
be
still
do
the
work
,
but
they
be
now
do
it
under
a
new
management
regime
of
Irish
Water
.
everyone
would
accept
that
this
be
unnecessary
,
and
it
be
do
with
a
extra
capital
cost
that
be
not
need
previously
for
the
staff
.
indeed
,
we
now
learn
that
they
be
subsidise
somewhere
in
the
region
of
€
2500000000
per
annum
out
of
we
motor
tax
money
.
that
money
should
be
go
into
upgrade
the
infrastructure
that
we
all
need
for
road
,
commute
and
open
up
other
way
for
industry
around
the
country
,
where
it
would
be
much
well
spend
rather
than
spend
subsidise
a
agency
that
be
not
require
at
this
time
or
at
any
stage
.
I
be
not
in
favour
of
have
water
charge
currently
or
at
any
stage
.
they
need
to
be
suspend
.
we
also
need
to
look
at
a
waiver
system
,
which
should
have
be
consider
and
implement
for
that
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
.
there
be
many
people
,
whom
we
all
meet
at
we
clinic
every
week
and
whom
we
have
meet
canvass
,
who
simply
cannot
afford
to
pay
.
in
the
short
time
available
to
I
I
propose
to
outline
the
response
of
the
government
,
through
Irish
Aid
,
to
the
crisis
in
Syria
.
I
be
pleased
to
have
have
the
privilege
of
lead
Irish
Aid
's
response
in
the
past
two
year
,
as
Minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
development
and
trade
.
next
month
the
first
ever
world
humanitarian
summit
will
be
hold
in
Istanbul
.
it
be
call
by
the
Unite
Nation
Secretary
General
.
the
summit'
host
country
,
Turkey
,
have
also
become
host
to
the
world
's
large
refugee
population
in
the
past
five
year
,
with
more
than
2.7
million
Syrian
refugee
live
in
the
country
.
as
the
refugee
crisis
have
unfold
in
the
Middle
East
,
the
government
have
be
respond
,
on
behalf
of
the
Irish
people
,
through
Irish
Aid
.
by
the
end
of
the
year
,
we
will
have
provide
€
62
million
for
the
Syrian
crisis
alone
.
we
have
make
specific
effort
in
support
of
we
European
partner
,
in
particular
,
Greece
and
the
Balkans
.
we
provide
core
support
for
the
Red
Cross
and
the
UN
high
Commission
for
Refugee
which
have
be
particularly
active
in
meet
the
immediate
need
of
refugee
in
Europe
.
since
the
start
of
2015
Irish
Aid
have
provide
€
180000
specifically
to
support
the
work
of
non-governmental
organisation
,
NGO
,
partner
in
Macedonia
alone
.
under
Ireland
's
rapid
response
initiative
,
we
have
also
deploy
two
rapid
responder
to
Serbia
and
Macedonia
and
a
further
two
to
Greece
.
a
further
deployment
next
week
will
support
the
UNHCR
's
provision
of
water
and
sanitation
service
for
refugee
there
.
that
arrive
in
Europe
start
they
journey
in
many
place
.
in
the
past
decade
most
migrant
arrive
from
sub-Saharan
and
north
Africa
.
however
,
the
Syrian
conflict
have
dramatically
change
the
profile
of
migrant
flow
and
Syrian
be
now
the
large
group
arrive
in
Europe
,
accounting
for
almost
half
of
that
arrive
in
Greece
last
year
.
last
month
mark
the
fifth
anniversary
of
the
start
of
the
brutal
Syrian
conflict
which
the
United
Nation
estimate
have
cause
up
to
400000
death
.
the
continue
violence
and
war
crime
which
have
force
million
of
Syrian
to
flee
they
home
and
country
must
end
and
that
responsible
must
be
hold
accountable
.
to
echo
the
point
make
by
deputy
Brendan
Smith
,
Ireland
firmly
believe
the
UN
Security
Council
should
refer
the
situation
in
Syria
to
the
International
criminal
Court
.
Ireland
urge
all
side
in
the
Geneva
negotiation
to
support
a
political
resolution
of
the
conflict
and
the
formation
of
a
representative
transitional
government
.
while
a
political
solution
be
desperately
need
,
sadly
,
it
be
not
clear
that
one
will
be
achieve
soon
.
need
be
rise
to
the
point
at
which
the
global
humanitarian
response
cannot
keep
up
with
they
.
Ireland
have
be
provide
assistance
for
Syrian
since
2012
and
this
aid
have
be
scale
up
as
the
impact
of
the
conflict
have
worsen
.
more
than
4.8
million
people
have
already
have
to
leave
Syria
.
in
2015
Ireland
provide
more
than
€
13
million
in
assistance
for
the
country
.
in
February
,
at
the
London
pledging
conference
on
Syria
,
I
commit
Ireland
to
provide
a
further
€
20
million
in
2016
.
Irish
Aid
funding
be
support
Irish
non-governmental
organisation
,
include
concern
,
GOAL
and
Trócaire
,
in
they
work
with
refugee
in
Syria
and
the
surround
region
.
the
statistic
for
the
number
affect
by
the
Syria
crisis
and
the
amount
of
funding
need
to
meet
they
need
be
so
staggering
that
the
human
story
behind
the
number
be
often
forget
.
previous
speaker
articulate
detail
of
individual
case
.
last
October
I
visit
the
refugee
camp
in
Azraq
,
Jordan
.
in
one
of
the
shelter
I
meet
a
mother
who
have
give
birth
to
she
third
child
at
a
border
post
without
medical
assistance
.
she
and
she
child
subsequently
present
to
a
Red
Cross
hospital
in
the
UN
camp
in
Azraq
.
when
one
consider
that
the
average
displacement
period
of
refugee
child
be
17
year
,
one
wonder
what
the
future
hold
for
she
child
.
how
will
they
grow
up
?
if
the
family
leave
a
neighbourhood
in
Syria
where
school
have
be
bomb
before
present
in
highly
traumatic
circumstance
to
a
refugee
camp
in
a
place
such
as
Azraq
,
how
will
the
child
fulfil
they
destiny
,
if
one
will
,
if
they
have
be
traumatise
to
such
a
extent
that
they
cannot
present
to
the
local
school
in
the
refugee
camp
?
we
be
leave
a
whole
generation
behind
.
Irish
people
be
do
what
they
can
in
we
external
response
through
the
aid
agency
and
multilateral
organisation
.
we
be
ensure
daily
,
whether
through
diplomatic
channel
or
the
work
we
do
with
individual
aid
agency
,
that
we
influence
the
work
be
do
on
the
ground
in
order
that
the
people
we
be
try
to
help
can
at
least
have
some
semblance
of
hope
for
the
future
.
the
global
humanitarian
crisis
have
result
in
the
displacement
of
at
least
56
million
people
who
will
need
humanitarian
assistance
.
the
country
affect
include
Somalia
,
Sudan
,
Yemen
and
northern
Nigeria
.
this
conflict
may
not
yet
have
prick
the
consciousness
of
many
Irish
people
,
but
the
world
humanitarian
summit
present
we
with
a
opportunity
.
I
be
hopeful
the
next
Taoiseach
,
whoever
he
may
be
,
and
the
President
will
attend
to
give
voice
to
Ireland
's
position
on
the
need
for
global
leadership
to
prevent
and
end
conflict
of
this
nature
.
the
majority
of
global
cris
be
protract
and
last
over
a
decade
or
more
.
I
hope
we
can
continue
as
a
nation
to
play
we
role
and
hope
that
in
the
new
politics
of
this
House
,
we
can
find
mechanism
through
the
committee
to
enable
we
come
together
and
form
a
common
bond
regard
how
this
parliament
,
as
representative
of
the
people
,
can
well
represent
how
taxpayer
invest
they
hard
-
earn
money
in
meet
the
need
of
the
people
we
have
be
speak
for
here
today
.
we
have
a
opportunity
to
continue
in
that
vein
.
I
will
finish
with
the
word
of
W.H.
Auden
.
today
be
poetry
day
Ireland
and
this
word
be
from
Auden
's
poem
Refugee
Blues
:
once
we
have
a
country
and
we
think
it
fair
,
look
in
the
atlas
and
you
will
find
it
there
:
we
cannot
go
there
now
,
my
dear
,
we
can
not
go
there
now
.
in
the
village
churchyard
there
grow
a
old
yew
,
every
spring
it
blossom
anew
:
Old

can't
do
that
,
my
dear
,
old
passport
can't
do
that
.
on
behalf
of
the
Minister
for
Justice
and
Equality
,
deputy
Frances
Fitzgerald
,
and
the
government
,
I
thank
deputy
from
all
side
of
this
House
for
the
wide
range
of
contribution
that
have
be
make
throughout
this
debate
.
the
level
of
engagement
from
all
side
recognise
that
this
be
a
issue
on
which
there
be
cross
-party
concern
and
one
,
I
hope
,
on
which
we
can
generate
cross-party
consensus
in
term
of
how
this
country
,
the
EU
and
the
international
community
must
respond
to
the
humanitarian
refugee
crisis
.
that
be
what
it
be
:
a
humanitarian
crisis
.
I
agree
with
that
who
call
it
that
.
I
echo
the
point
make
by
many
that
we
be
well
-
serve
by
the
fact
that
this
house
,
traditionally
and
right
through
to
this
thirty
-
second
Dáil
,
have
always
be
one
which
have
agree
and
respond
positively
to
request
for
solidarity
and
action
in
assist
refugee
seek
protection
within
the
EU
.
I
be
strike
by
the
number
of
my
constituent
contact
my
office
by
telephone
and
e-mail
ask
that
more
be
do
,
that
this
country
must
do
more
and
that
they
want
Ireland
to
play
its
part
in
support
refugee
in
they
relocation
effort
.
that
be
a
message
we
have
all
receive
in
this
House
.
it
be
one
that
we
have
to
hear
very
clearly
.
we
citizen
want
Ireland
to
be
to
the
fore
in
push
for
solution
to
this
humanitarian
crisis
.
I
be
move
by
deputy
Brady
's
reference
to
the
poem
Home
by
Warsan
Shire
which
I
just
look
up
.
I
think
it
put
word
to
the
very
serious
humanitarian
crisis
which
can
be
all
too
often
dehumanise
in
the
media
and
in
politics
.
this
be
real
people
.
nobody
put
they
child
on
a
boat
or
into
a
awful
situation
should
they
not
feel
the
absolute
necessity
to
do
so
for
the
safety
and
well
-
being
of
they
family
.
in
response
to
deputy
McGrath
's
point
,
I
too
be
very
proud
,
as
I
presume
all
member
of
this
house
be
and
as
many
have
express
,
of
the
role
be
play
by
the
Irish
Navy
.
the
Minister
for
Defence
,
deputy
Simon
Coveney
,
confirm
early
today
in
this
House
that
the
Navy
will
continue
to
make
that
effort
and
that
there
will
be
a
further
deployment
this
Sunday
regard
member
of
the
Naval
Service
.
they
continue
assistance
and
involvement
be
something
we
all
welcome
.
I
refer
to
the
point
make
by
deputy
McGrath
and
other
about
the
importance
of
Ireland
in
help
the
resettlement
and
relocation
of
the
4000
people
that
we
have
commit
to
.
that
commitment
still
stand
from
this
government
and
this
State
.
the
difficulty
of
the
low
number
to
date
arise
from
external
issue
.
the
target
of
4000
people
be
still
very
much
the
commitment
of
the
State
.
it
be
a
number
that
could
increase
when
family
unification
be
take
on
board
.
Ireland
continue
,
and
will
continue
,
to
play
its
part
at
a
EU
level
to
implement
agree
solution
to
this
refugee
crisis
.
we
will
continue
to
ensure
that
all
measure
take
be
in
full
respect
of
human
dignity
and
in
line
with
we
EU
and
international
obligation
.
at
home
,
we
must
ensure
that
Ireland
remain
a
welcoming
and
inclusive
society
for
that
in
need
of
we
protection
.
this
House
have
a
role
to
play
in
foster
public
debate
which
support
the
humane
and
respectful
treatment
of
asylum
seeker
and
person
flee
war
and
persecution
.
that
have
always
be

tradition
here
.

it
be
clear
,
however
,
that
we
asylum
system
be
in
need
of
reform
.
that
be
a
point
that
have
be
raise
throughout
this
debate
.
this
government
have
introduce
reform
legislation
.
last
December
,
the
House
debate
and
pass
the
International
Protection
Bill
.
the
International
Protection
act
will
reform
the
system
for
examine
and
determine
application
for
international
protection
in
Ireland
through
the
introduction
of
a
single
application
procedure
.
under
the
single
procedure
,
a
applicant
will
make
only
one
application
and
will
have
all
grounds
to
seek
international
protection
and
to
be
permit
to
remain
in
the
State
while
be
examine
and
determine
in
one
process
.
this
single
procedure
will
replace
the
current
multi-layered
and
sequential
protection
application
and
appeal
system
and
be
intend
to
achieve
the
desire
balance
in
treat
asylum
seeker
with
the
humanity
and
respect
they
deserve
,
whilst
also
ensure
that
we
have
a
more
efficient
asylum
and
immigration
procedure
and
safeguard
in
place
.
many
of
the
Deputy
raise
the
issue
of
direct
provision
.
the
report
of
the
working
group
which
be
publish
by
Government
last
June
make
a
total
of
173
recommendation
.
many
of
this
have
implication
for
a
number
of
government
Department
and
service
.
the
Department
of
Justice
and
Equality
recently
complete
a
consultation
exercise
on
the
status
of
the
recommendation
across
all
the
responsible
division
,
Department
and
agency
.
the
exercise
have
show
that
90
of
the
recommendation
have
be
fully
implement
and
a
further
26
be
in
the
process
of
be
implement
.
some
116
recommendation
have
be
progress
since
the
report
's
publication
in
June
2014
and
a
further
46
recommendation
be
the
subject
of
ongoing
consideration
by
the
cabinet
committee
on
social
policy
.
this
represent
yet
another
need
to
form
a
government
so
that
we
can
progress
this
further
.
I
believe
it
be
important
that
we
continue
to
pursue
this
issue
and
that
we
do
not
simply
have
a
one
-
off
debate
.
this
be
something
that
be
go
to
require
work
from
all
Member
of
the
thirty
-
second
Dáil
and
I
hope
it
be
something
on
which
we
can
continue
to
build
political
consensus
.

the
Labour
Party
recognise
the
central
place
of
the
Irish
language
in
we
heritage
,
we
history
and
as
a
rich
resource
for
daily
life
.
the
Constitution
explicitly
recognise
Irish
as
the
first
language
of
the
State
and
it
be
we
view
that
this
place
certain
responsibility
on
all
government
to
vigorously
support
the
protection
and
development
of
the
language
.
I
want
to
take
a
slightly
different
tack
today
.
I
speak
through
the
medium
of
English
.
I
feel
strongly
that
Irish
be
often
present
in
a
binary
fashion
,
typify
by
that
who
have
the
language
and
that
who
do
not
.
the
last
census
record
more
than
160
language
be
speak
in
this
country
and
we
have
a
multiplicity
of
nationality
here
now
.
I
believe
that
in
the
globalised
society
we
live
in
,
we
must
recognise
the
attempt
by
that
who
be
seek
to
encourage
bilingualism
and
multilingualism
within
this
island
.
it
be
not
about
one
language
be
good
than
another
but
about
use
language
efficiently
.
it
be
also
about
seek
to
encourage
great
awareness
of
the
critical
importance
of
language
learning
,
not
only
in
term
of
increase
employment
possibility
and
meet
industry
need
,
but
also
its
broad
value
in
the
sphere
of
education
,
the
art
and
in
the
context
of
support
social
cohesion
and
intercultural
understanding
.
in
that
context
,
Irish
have
a
significant
role
to
play
in
term
of
encourage
multilingualism
and
bilingualism
.

what
we
will
do
:
act
as
a
rallying
point
and
a
powerful
voice
for
all
interested
in
language
issue
.
globalisation
have
change
we
experience
of
language
diversity
.
there
be
now
few
place
in
the
world
in
which
multiple
language
be
not
present
and
in
which
people
do
not
make
use
of
repertoire
that
draw
on
several
different
language
.
as
a
former
minister
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
,
I
have
find
there
be
ample
research
evidence
regard
the
numerous
benefit
of
language
learning
.
for
example
,
in
the
Irish
context
research
have
demonstrate
that
bilingualism
in
Irish
and
English
enhance
mathematics
performance
and
that
the
Irish
language
lend
itself
to
the
good
understanding
of
mathematical
concept
.
there
have
be
repeat
statement
from
high
-
level
industry
leader
,
employment
specialist
,
advisory
body
and
experienced
linguist
on
the
deficit
in
appropriate
language
skill
and
the
important
role
the
learning
of
other
language
,
of
which
Irish
be
one
,
can
play
in
the
improvement
of
literacy
level
.
a
appreciation
need
to
be
foster
,
at
government
level
and
among
the
wide
public
,
on
the
significant
cognitive
,
social
,
developmental
,
cultural
and
linguistic
enhancement
that
can
be
attain
through
the
learning
of
Irish
or
other
additional
language
.
we
need
to
improve
the
teaching
and
learning
of
science
,
mathematics
and
engineering
and
research
show
that
where
student
be
educate
through
the
medium
of
Irish
,
and
where
they
live
in
bilingual
community
,
they
learning
outcome
be
a
lot
good
.
we
should
focus
more
on
that
opportunity
.
I
speak
for
thousand
of
people
throughout
this
country
when
I
say
I
do
not
know
if
I
will
ever
be
fluent
but
I
would
love
to
be
able
to
conduct
my
everyday
business
in
a
bilingual
way
.
perhaps
we
need
to
focus
more
on
the
opportunity
therein
.
I
be
glad
I
live
in
a
area
where
,
over
the
past
five
year
,
there
have
be
a
explosion
in
the
number
of
place
in
Gaelscoileanna
and
there
be
two
Gaelscoileanna
under
construction
in
my
constituency
,
in
Mainistir
Fhear
Maí
and
Mainistir
to
Corann
.
we
be
very
proud
of
that
and
we
want
to
ensure
that
there
be
a
continuum
between
what
student
learn
at
primary
level
and
what
they
learn
at
post
-
primary
level
.
we
need
to
do
more
to
encourage
people
in
community
like
Mallow
,
Fermoy
and
Midleton
,
where
we
have
this
Gaelscoileanna
,
to
use
the
language
in
they
everyday
transaction
on
the
street
or
through
interaction
with
government
agency
.
we
need
to
wide
the
debate
and
recognise
that
there
be
over
160
language
speak
in
this
country
.
we
need
to
ensure
we
target
resource
in
a
way
that
ensure
that
more
people
speak
the
language
or
,
at
least
,
be
inculcate
with
the
language
during
everyday
usage
,
and
this
be
a
big
challenge
.
we
be
all
wed
to
the
20
-
year
strategy
and
if
we
witness
economic
growth
we
need
to
ensure
the
resource
be
make
available
so
that
the
plan
bear
fruit
.
every
time
there
be
a
debate
on
the
Irish
language
somebody
get
up
and
say
somebody
have
such
a
amount
of
proficiency
and
somebody
else
do
not
.
let
we
get
away
from
that
binary
,
hackneyed
debate
and
broaden
it
out
so
that
we
can
get
more
people
actually
speak
Irish
.
let
we
encourage
people
to
speak
the
language
more
and
if
we
broaden
the
debate
we
can
also
encourage
the
use
of
bilingualism
in
everyday
life
.
that
be
a
very
reasonable
proposition
.
in
the
spirit
of
this
new
dispensation
and
new
politics
,
the
Labour
Party
intend
to
support
the
passage
of
this
Bill
to
Committee
stage
.
we
believe
the
Oireachtas
,
through
its
committee
,
have
the
requisite
capacity
to
interrogate
the
three
flaw
,
as
articulate
by
the
minister
,
deputy
Noonan
,
namely
the
constitutionality
of
the
Bill
,
the
need
to
consult
the
ECB
before
the
intend
Bill
could
be
enact
and
the
statement
by
the
Governor
of
the
Central
Bank
that
it
do
not
wish
to
regulate
interest
rate
.
if
it
be
the
will
of
the
House
that
this
Bill
be
consider
under
pre-legislative
scrutiny
,
then
so
be
it
.
however
,
we
see
no
reason
that
be
necessary

of

Bill
,
which
deal
with
the
issuance
of
a

by
the

Bank
to

specific
lender
or
lender
,
deserve
further
scrutiny
.
the
issue
of
contract
law
loom
large
over
the
section
but
we
believe
that
this
be
something
that
can
be
examine
further
at
the
next
stage
of
the
Bill
.
we
recognise
that
bank
have
to
make
a
profit
but
there
be
a
fine
line
between
make
a
profit
and
profiteering
.
a
person
in
my
constituency
of
Cork
East
take
out
a
mortgage
in
2009
with
permanent
TSB
.
since
2009
,
that
person
have
be
pay
interest
,
in
one
specific
period
,
at
rate
of
up
to
6.5
%
.
the
borrower
estimate
that
over
the
lifetime
of
the
mortgage
he
could
end
up
pay
a
additional
€
100000
in
interest
payment
alone
and
what
grieve
that
person
be
the
fact
that
mortgage
product
that
be
offer
now
on
a
similar
property
of
similar
value
be
significantly
cheap
.
he
recognise
that
he
sign
a
contract
,
and
he
recognise
that
bank
must
make
a
profit
but
with
some
justification
he
feel
that
have
to
pay
up
to
€
100000
more
than
he
neighbour
for
the
same
amount
of
money
borrow
,
albeit
from
a
different
bank
,
be
unfair
.
on
committee
stage
my
party
intend
to
examine
more
closely
the
issue
of
marginal
interest
.
the
question
of
profitability
versus
profiteering
could
be
address
,
for
instance
,
through
the
capping
of
variable
interest
rate
such
that
,
for
instance
,
if
the
ECB
set
a
rate
at
2.5
%
,
a
margin
could
be
determine
,
for
instance
,
two
percentage
point
in
excess
of
that
,
which
would
allow
for
a
degree
of
profitability
and
competition
without
profiteer
in
that
bank
could
compete
within
the
two
percentage
point
margin
.
we
want
to
explore
that
at
a
further
stage
or
at
least
have
a
proper
discussion
in
a
collegiate
way
around
that
.
I
accept
it
be
interventionist
within
the
market
but
my
party
consider
it
be
worthy
of
further
examination
.
we
have
some
question
on
section
2
,
on
the
assessment
.
it
be
difficult
to
understand
how
the
Central
Bank
,
subject
to
the
11
"
factor
"
outline
in
the
assessment
in
the
Bill
,
could
reasonably
conclude
that
a
market
failure
exist
.
section
4
(
2
)
state
that
"
"
market
failure
"
shall
mean
a
situation
in
which
market
condition
be
such
that
a
lender
be
,
or
lender
be
,
charge
a
variable
interest
rate
or
variable
interest
rate
for
principal
dwelling
house
mortgage
loan
which
be
high
than
the
Central
Bank
consider
can
be
reasonably
and
objectively
justify
by
reference
to
the
factor
set
out
in
section
3
.
"
the
question
be
,
how
can
the
Central
Bank
,
even
when
the
11
factor
be
take
into
account
in
section
3
,
reasonably
intervene
to
make
a
direction
in
a
individual
or
collective
case
if
that
individual
have
,
in
the
first
instance
,
sign
a
contract
with
a
mortgage
provider
,
and
the
question
then
arise
,
do
the
law
of
contract
supersede
the
enactment
of
this
Bill
or
do
this
Bill
give
power
to
the
Central
Bank
that
may
be
subservient
to
the
law
of
contract
.
my
party
have
a
open
mind
in
term
of
explore
that
question
at
the
next
stage
and
while
we
may
differ
from
deputy
Paul
Murphy
in
regard
to
the
recognition
that
bank
must
make
a
profit
,
we
have
to
distinguish
between
make
a
profit
and
profiteering
.
in
the
spirit
of
the
new
paradigm
,
in
this
current
enlightenment
period
,
which
I
hope
will
last
,
we
will
explore
the
Bill
further
.
we
believe
that
there
be
not
necessarily
a
need
for
pre-legislative
scrutiny
because
we
all
have
the
wherewithal
within
this
House
to
be
able
to
interrogate
the
Bill
further
and
if
we
need
to
bring
in
expert
to
address
any
of
the
issue
or
the
question
that
may
be
outstanding
then
in
the
spirit
of
the
new
dispensation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
we
should
take
a
pragmatic
view
on
this
Bill
and
allow
it
to
proceed
to
the
next
stage
and
discuss
this
matter
further
.
I
thank
deputy
Lawless
for
he
kind
word
and
I
wish
to
reciprocate
they
.
I
hope
he
have
a
long
and
happy
period
in
this
House
.
as
he
have
be
a
constituent
of
mine
,
I
would
also
say
that
,
while
I
have
never
be
a
constituent
of
he
,
most
of
my
family
come
from
Kildare
and
there
be
many
constituent
leave
there
who
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
do
he
a
favour
in
the
future
.
I
be
not
sure
I
can
do
a
great
deal
for
he
today
,
but
I
can
certainly
give
he
a
reply
to
the
question
he
have
put
.

will
proceed
under
the
current
capital
plan
.
a
pholaitíocht
nua
.
with
a
few
short
word
,
I
express
the
concern
of
the
people
of
Cobh
,
who
be
currently
read
a
recent
study
by
the
National
Cancer
Registry
of
Ireland
indicate
that
the
rate
of
prostate
cancer
there
be
71
%
high
than
the
national
average
,
with
female
breast
cancer
incidence
38
%
above
the
norm
.
the
people
of
Cobh
be
very
concerned
.
while
he
be
in
the
House
,
I
congratulate
my
constituency
colleague
,
the
minister
of
State
,
deputy
David
Stanton
,
on
he
new
position
.
I
know
he
have
speak
on
this
issue
and
express
concern
about
it
in
the
past
.
I
raise
this
issue
because
when
the
National
Cancer
Registry
be
ask
for
a
reason
that
the
rate
be
high
in
Cobh
,
it
state
that
it
could
be
down
to
the
issue
of
social
deprivation
.
I
do
not
believe
that
be
a
proper
answer
when
ask
a
question
of
that
nature
.
we
know
that
Cobh
be
a
town
with
a
history
of
heavy
industry
,
that
there
be
a
remediation
programme
go
on
at
the
moment
in
a
area
in
which
heavy
industry
be
no
long
locate
and
that
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
be
monitor
the
pharmaceutical
or
pharmachem
industry
in
the
low
harbour
area
.
however
,
we
do
not
have
actual
clean
air
monitoring
at
specific
reference
point
throughout
the
Cobh
area
and
there
be
no
live
reporting
to
the
public
.
it
could
be
beneficial
if
a
baseline
study
be
instigate
for
Cobh
and
a
full
investigation
could
be
carry
out
.
this
could
be
do
without
necessarily
put
a
extra
charge
on
the
Exchequer
because
there
be
a
number
of
stakeholder
,
such
as
gps
and
ucc
,
in
particular
,
which
have
address
the
strategic
policy
committee
of
Cork
County
Council
,
that
be
,
the
environment
committee
.
the
department
of
chemistry
and
the
environmental
research
unit
have
state
that
they
would
be
happy
to
conduct
study
in
this
area
.
it
be
a
issue
that
affect
every
family
in
Cobh
.
Professor
Colin
Bradley
,
a
professor
of
general
practice
,
state
recently
:
"
I
have
see
more
cancer
in
surprisingly
young
people
than
I
would
in
previous
practice
"
.
he
be
refer
specifically
to
Cobh
.
I
believe
it
be
a
issue
that
be
worthy
of
further
investigation
.
I
do
not
accept
the
social
deprivation
answer
that
have
be
give
by
the
National
Cancer
Registry
.
we
lay
the
work
it
do
but
we
need
some
empirical
evidence
.
it
would
appear
that
there
be
a
intergenerational
increase
in
the
rate
of
cancer
,
not
only
prostate
and
female
breast
cancer
,
but
also
in
other
area
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
at
least
to
consider
facilitate
some
stakehold
engagement
on
this
issue
.
I
be
not
necessarily
look
for
a
cheque
for
a
baseline
study
but
if
we
can
get
a
favourable
response
from
the
minister
to
the
idea
of
put
together
some
sort
of
stakeholder
group
involve
ucc
,
which
have
state
that
it
would
be
willing
at
least
to
partake
in
further
study
on
this
issue
,
then
we
could
seek
to
deliver
something
for
the
people
in
Cobh
,
who
be
gravely
concerned
about
the
matter
.
I
be
ask
the
minister
to
have
a
open
mind
.
I
will
leave
he
with
one
metric
.
if
one
look
at
the
1994
to
2007
figure
,
the
urban
area
of
Cobh
have
a
37
%
high
incidence
than
other
part
of
the
country
.
that
would
mean
that
within
that
timeframe
,
someone
in
Cobh
be
diagnose
with
cancer
every
11
day
.
I
thank
the
Acting
Chairman
and
hope
I
will
receive
a
favourable
reply
.
I
thank
Deputy
O'Dowd
,
Breathnach
,
Adams
and
Munster
for
raise
this
issue
and
for
allow
I
to
address
the
House
on
the
matter
.
in
direct
response
to
deputy
Munster
's
question
,
the
first
thing
I
be
go
to
do
be
stop
play
party
politics
with
the
health
service
,
and
that
be
why
I
receive
cabinet
approval
today
to
move
ahead
with
the
motion
-
which
I
understand
deputy
Munster
's
own
party
and
indeed
every
party
in
this
House
feel
very
strongly
about
-
to
set
up
a
cross
-party
committee
to
meet
within
six
month
to
look
at
a
single
vision
for
a
single
tier
public
health
service
and
how
we
be
go
to
fund
that
.
I
look
forward
to
constructive
idea
on
that
measure
.
I
regret
that
a
decision
be
make
to
undertake
industrial
action
in
we
Lady
of
Lourdes
Hospital
,
Drogheda
follow
the
breakdown
of
talk
at
the
Workplace
Relation
Commission
,
WRC
,
last
Friday
on
resolution
of
the
staffing
difficulty
at
the
hospital
.
I
believe
that
the
interest
of
patient
be
always
well
serve
through
negotiation
and
by
avoid
industrial
action
.
Industrial
action
,
even
if
it
be
limit
to
non-core
duty
,
be
not
in
the
good
interest
of
patient
care
and
cannot
resolve
the
staffing
issue
.
nonetheless
,
I
take
the
point
make
by
deputy
Munster
about
care
professionalism
and
I
be
sure
it
be
not
a
decision
any
nurse
take
lightly
.
I
be
pleased
,
therefore
,
that
the
INMO
and
the
HSE
have
accept
a
invitation
from
the
WRC
to
attend
a
meeting
tomorrow
to
discuss
the
issue
.
I
welcome
this
progress
and
this
recommencement
of
talk
.
I
be
satisfied
that
the
issue
raise
by
the
INMO
can
be
well
address
through
engagement
at
the
WRC
.
meanwhile
,
the
hospital
be
implement
a
contingency
plan
to
minimise
,
in
so
far
as
be
possible
,
the
impact
of
the
industrial
action
on
patient
care
.
the
emergency
department
will
remain
open
over
the
course
of
the
industrial
action
in
a
effort
to
continue
to
meet
patient
's
emergency
medical
need
.
unfortunately
,
the
contingency
plan
include
cancel
all
plan
,
non-urgent
elective
procedure
today
other
than
cancer
related
care
.
patient
whose
appointment
be
affect
be
contact
directly
by
the
hospital
and
a
new
date
will
be
re-schedule
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
want
to
correct
the
impression
that
there
be
a
recruitment
embargo
at
present
.
this
be
not
the
case
and
there
be
no
blanket
embargo
on
recruitment
.
while
there
have
to
be
compliance
with
national
pay
structure
and
management
of
employment
number
within
budget
in
the
HSE
,
there
be
scope
for
hospital
to
continue
to
recruit
,
particularly
across
key
department
such
as
intensive
care
unit
,
theatre
and
emergency
department
.
we
Lady
of
Lourdes
recognise
the
need
for
ongoing
recruitment
drive
due
to
the
movement
of
staff
across
the
HSE
and
to
other
health
care
service
in
Ireland
and
abroad
.
to
date
,
34
nurse
and
midwive
have
be
recruit
to
the
hospital
this
year
and
21
staff
nurse
be
in
the
process
of
be
recruit
.
at
present
there
be
two
campaign
of
particular
relevance
:
a
Royal
College
of
Surgeons
in
Ireland
hospital
group
competition
and
a
initiative
to
offer
all
nursing
graduate
of
2016
the
opportunity
for
permanent
nursing
post
.
the
HSE
have
continually
increase
staffing
level
since
the
beginning
of
2015
.
by
the
end
of
March
2016
overall
health
service
employee
number
have
increase
by
58856
whole
-
time
equivalent
,
the
vast
majority
in
front
-
line
position
.
during
that
15
-
month
period
from
January
2015
,
the
number
employ
in
acute
hospital
increase
by
3500
whole
-
time
equivalent
,
with
nursing
number
up
by
more
than
1700
whole
-
time
equivalent
during
the
same
timeframe
.
I
assure
deputy
that
the
government
be
fully
aware
of
the
difficulty
and
challenge
.
I
be
due
to
meet
the
INMO
tomorrow
to
discuss
nursing
issue
in
general
and
I
look
forward
to
engage
constructively
with
it
and
to
continue
the
very
constructive
role
it
play
in
co-chair
the
emergency
department
task
force
as
we
all
work
together
as
stakeholder
to
try
to
address
the
issue
face
we
emergency
department
and
hospital
staff
,
include
nurse
and
midwive
,
in
deliver
care
.
it
be
my
intention
to
continue
to
grow
the
health
budget
as
the
economy
improve
and
to
obtain
the
resource
necessary
to
improve
working
condition
for
front
-
line
staff
to
enable
we
to
deliver
the
level
of
service
that
we
all
want
to
provide
to
we
patient
.
I
wish
to
put
the
health
service
employee
number
on
the
record
in
this
House
.
while
it
do
not
always
fit
the
political
narrative
,
the
number
be
the
number
.
I
absolutely
accept
there
be
still
some
way
to
go
to
get
back
to
the
number
of
front
-
line
staff
work
in
we
hospital
before
the
recession
but
it
be
important
to
note
that
the
number
have
continue
to
increase
since
December
2013
.
at
that
time
,
there
be
47,934
people
work
in
the
acute
sector
.
in
December
2014
,
that
figure
have
increase
to
49742
.
by
December
2015
,
it
have
increase
to
52539
.
in
March
2016
,
that
number
stand
at
53253
.
with
regard
to
nurse
,
include
midwive
,
at
the
end
of
2014
there
be
34211
,
which
rise
to
35036
in
March
2015
and
to
35918
in
March
2016
.
since
December
2014
,
there
have
be
a
increase
of
1,707
nurse
,
which
be
a
5
%
increase
.
since
March
2015
,
there
have
be
a
increase
of
825
,
which
be
a
2.5
%
increase
.
there
be
significantly
more
to
do
but
it
be
simply
not
correct
to
put
the
narrative
out
there
that
nursing
number
and
front
-
line
staff
be
decline
when
in
fact
the
opposite
be
true
.
deputy
O'Dowd
's
invitation
to
visit
we
Lady
of
Lourdes
Hospital
be
absolutely
something
I
would
like
to
take
up
and
I
look

to
visit
shortly
.
I

34211
,
which
rise
to
35036
in
March
2015
and
to
35918
in
March
2016
.
since
December
2014
,
there
have
be
a
increase
of
1,707
nurse
,
which
be
a
5
%
increase

since
March
2015
,
there
have
be
a
increase
of

,
which
be
a
2.5

increase
.
there
be
significantly
more
to
do
but
it
be
simply
not
correct
to
put
the
narrative
out
there
that
nursing
number
and
front

line

be
decline
when
in
fact
the
opposite
be
true
.
deputy
O'Dowd
's
invitation
to
visit
we
Lady
of
Lourdes
Hospital
be
absolutely
something
I
would
like
to
take
up
and
I
look
forward
to
visit
shortly
.
we
support
the
motion
before
the
House
and
acknowledge
wholeheartedly
that
after
42
year
we
seem
to
be
no
close
to
the
truth
,
despite
the
good
effort
of
Barron
and
MacEntee
and
the
good
effort
of
this
House
as
articulate
in
its
report
of
2004
and
the
subsequent
motion
of
2008
and
2011
.
now
,
here
we
be
again
seek
to
speak
for
the
victim
and
articulate
on
a
cross-
party
basis
and
in
a
manner
which
speak
for
all
of
the
people
within
the
26
county
that
we
want
to
assist
the
victim
and
they
family
in
seek
truth
.
I
worry
sometimes
when
I
stand
before
this
House
speak
on
this
issue
.
it
have
take
42
year
of
debate
,
cajoling
and
effort
on
the
part
of
the
victim
and
they
family
,
and
I
hope
we
will
not
let
another
generation
go
by
before
we
do
finally
seek
truth
on
this
matter
.
I
read
a
speech
by
the
UK
Secretary
of
State
,
Theresa
Villier
,
recently
.
it
be
give
on
11
February
2016
.
in
the
speech
she
state
,
"
the
government
fully
recognise
that
it
will
be
much
more
difficult
to
achieve
we
objective
of
build
a
genuinely
share
future
for
everyone
in
Northern
Ireland
unless
and
until
we
can
find
some
way
of
come
to
term
with
a
divide
past
.
"
she
go
on
to
say
:
where
there
be
evidence
of
wrongdoing
it
will
be
pursue
.
everyone
be
subject
to
the
rule
of
law
.
however
,
it
would
appear
that
not
everyone
be
subject
to
the
rule
of
law
.
why
be
it
that
we
be
still
talk
about
this
42
year
late
,
in
a
era
of
suppose
transparency
,
where
we
be
try
to
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
and
have
be
through
two
iteration
of
talk
?
I
be
party
to
that
talk
in
2014
and
2015
and
it
seem
to
I
that
there
be
a
hunger
among
the
victim
and
survivor
for
simple
truth
and
that
the
issue
of
reconciliation
and
move
on
as
a
society
will
never
be
attain
fully
until
such
time
as
truth
reign
supreme
.
in
this
era
,
when
Anglo
-
Irish
relation
be
extremely
positive
and
evolve
in
a
positive
sense
,
I
do
not
see
why
we
cannot
facilitate
people
who
want
that
basic
and
fundamental
right
to
justice
.
it
be
worth
note
that
the
Oireachtas
sub
-
committee
examination
of
the
Barron
report
,
which
date
back
to
2004
,
state
:
(
ii
)
...
in
all
probability
most
if
not
all
of
the
perpetrator
come
from
Northern
Ireland
.
(
iii
)
that
in
all
probability
information
which
identify
and
which
concern
the
perpetrator
still
exist
in
Northern
Ireland
and
great
Britain
.
(
iv
)
that
in
all
probability
most
of
the
information
touch
on
collusion
in
relation
to
the
Dublin
and
Monaghan
bombing
be
in
Northern
Ireland
and
/
or
in
great
Britain
.
they
be
three
very
pertinent
point
and
I
do
not
think
the
situation
have
change
between
2004
and
2016
in
that
regard
.
I
know
that
successive
government
have
raise
this
issue
with
successive
British
government
and
I
know
,
have
serve
as
minister
for
North
-
South
co-operation
,
that
this
have
be
raise
very
recently
by
the
Minister
for
foreign
affair
and
Trade
,
deputy
Flanagan
.
I
also
know
,
to
be
fair
to
the
minister
,
that
he
constantly
raise
this
very
specific
issue
,
among
other
,
with
the
Secretary
of
State
.
I
believe
strongly
that
this
be
a
worthy
motion
.
diplomacy
be
very
effective
,
whether
it
be
economic
or
political
diplomacy
.
it
be
important
that
this
house
send
a
message
to
the
British
government
on
behalf
of
the
Irish
people
,
which
be
that
we
will
continue
to
press
for
justice
and
truth
and
that
we
will
allow
access
by
a
independent
international
judicial
figure
to
all
original
document
in
they
possession
pertain
to
this
bombing
.
this
issue
need
to
be
tackle
if
we
be
to
fulfil
good
relation
from
a
Anglo
-
Irish
and
North
-
South
perspective
.
I
believe
strongly
that
this
motion
be
worthy
of
support
on
a
cross
-party
basis
.
I
be
keen
to
acknowledge
the
work
of
justice
for
the
Forgotten
.
I
know
that
involve
be
in
constant
contact
with
official
in
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
Trade
.
I
wish
to
acknowledge
they
role
as
one
of
many
organisation
in
the
six
County
that
continue
to
advocate
for
victim
.
the
legacy
issue
be
not
deal
with
sufficiently
in
the
last
iteration
of
the
Stormont
talk
.
there
be
a
important
role
for
this
House
to
play
now
on
a
cross
-party
basis
.
we
must
ensure
that
we
continue
to
press
for
the
legacy
issue
to
be
deal
with
.
Society
,
North
and
South
,
will
not
fully
move
on
until
this
issue
be
deal
with
.
we
have
a
duty
of
care
to
people
within
the
six
County
to
continue
to
press
this
issue
with
the
British
government
.
I
be
happy
to
give
five
minute
to
my
colleague
if
he
want
to
eat
into
Labour
time
.
I
move
amendment
no.
1
to
amendment
no.
2
:
to
insert
the
follow
after
''
its
recommendation
by
the
Oireachtas
''
:
''
believe
that
that
who
have
pay
they
water
charge
in
accordance
with
law
should
not
now
be
unfairly
disadvantage
compare
to
that
who
have
not
;
consider
that
,
if
the
ongoing
liability
to
pay
be
suspend
,
there
would
be
no
practical
reality
to
pursue
outstanding
unpaid
charge
;
conclude
that
in
such
circumstance
the
only
fair
approach
would
be
to
make
a
full
refund
to
all
that
who
have
pay
they
water
charge
;
and
agree
in
principle
to
a
referendum
on
a
constitutional
amendment
that
commit
to
maintain
we
public
water
supply
and
treatment
system
,
and
we
electricity
and
gas
transmission
and
distribution
network
,
in
public
ownership
.
''
I
wish
to
reiterate
some
point
we
make
in
this
House
on
27
April
when
we
have
statement
on
Irish
Water
.
some
of
that
point
be
pertinent
to
tonight
's
debate
.
law
-
abide
people
who
do
pay
will
have
to
get
they
money
back
.
that
will
mean
Irish
Water
will
have
to
reprocess
well
in
excess
of
2
million
financial
transaction
.
regardless
of
whether
the
charge
be
to
be
suspend
or
abolish
,
the
Labour
Party
believe
the
government
must
tell
people
how
and
when
it
will
give
they
they
money
back
.
it
may
not
suit
political
discourse
at
present
but
it
be
a
matter
of
fact
that
Irish
Water
's
investment
have
deliver
34
new
treatment
plant
,
26
of
which
be
for
wastewater
and
eight
for
drinking
water
,
as
well
as
73
upgrade
involve
51
wastewater
and
22
drinking
water
facility
.
a
further
47
water
conservation
project
have
be
complete
and
452
kilometer
of
pipe
have
be
remediate
.
if
there
be
a
proposal
to
revert
to
the
local
authority
whereby
fund
would
be
divest
solely
through
the
Exchequer
through
that
local
authority
,
one
need
look
no
further
than
County
Roscommon
as
a
example
of
where
the
old
model
simply
do
not
work
.
I
believe
deputy
Fitzmaurice
already
have
make
reference
to
this
point
.
I
need
not
remind
member
of
the
improvement
it
have
make
the
life
of
more
than
17000
people
in
County
Roscommon
who
be
on
boil
water
notice
.
the
resident
of
Castlerea
,
for
example
,
be
subject
to
a
boil
water
notice
from
November
2009
to
June
2013
.
if
the
proposal
be
that
it
would
revert
to
the
local
authority
,
which
be
gain
credence
in
some
circle
,
and
that
funding
would
come
from
the
Exchequer
and
that
people
be
already
pay
for
water
through
they
taxation
,
why
then
be
it
that
this
issue
be
not
address
at
that
time
?
the
Labour
Party
amendment
and
the
addendum
seek
to
speak
for
that
who
do
pay
they
water
charge
.
we
believe
that
that
who
have
pay
they
charge
in
accordance
with
the
law
should
not
now
be
unfairly
disadvantage
compare
with
that
who
have
not
.
we
believe
that
if
the
ongoing
liability
to
pay
be
suspend
,
there
would
be
no
practical
reality
to
pursue
outstanding
unpaid
charge
and
that
in
such
circumstance
,
the
only
fair
approach
would
be
to
make
a
full
refund
to
all
that
who
have
pay
they
water
charge
.
moreover
,
the
Labour
Party
agree
in
principle
to
a
referendum
on
a
constitutional
amendment
that
commit
to
maintain
Ireland
's
public
water
supply
and
treatment
system
,
as
well
as
its
electricity
and
gas
transmission
and
distribution
network
in
public
ownership
.
the
Labour
Party
have
already
tab
a
Bill
in
this
regard
.
obviously
,
there
will
be
a
opportunity
for
the
hospital
,
through
the
hospital
group
structure
,
to
raise
whatever
issue
it
wish
to
raise
with
I
.
this
will
be
a
meeting
for
I
to
ascertain
the
priority
of
that
hospital
group
in
term
of
the
development
of
health
care
facility
in
the
region
.
the
deputy
also
make
a
valid
point
regard
the
ongoing
need
to
tackle
the
trolley
crisis
,
which
have
show
some
sign
of
improvement
this
month
although
,
overall
,
the
number
be
still
marginally
high
this
year
.
I
acknowledge
that
Galway
be
a
particular
area
of
difficulty
at
certain
time
.
I
will
attend
my
first
meeting
of
the
emergency
department
task
force
,
which
be
co-chair
by
the
INMO
and
the
HSE
,
with
relevant
stakeholder
next
Monday
and
I
certainly
will
seek
a
update
on
the
position
in
Galway
at
that
meeting
.
I
be
happy
to
keep
in
touch
with
deputy
Connolly
on
this
important
matter
and
I
hope
I
have
have
a
opportunity
to
outline
some
of
the
plan
service
improvement
and
capital
project
.
I
look
forward
to
have
a
opportunity
to
meet
the
Saolta
hospital
group
in

discuss
further

we
welcome
the
motion
to
develop
a
single
long
-
term
vision
or
plan
for
the
provision
of
health
care
.
I
add
my
congratulation
to
that
of
other
to
the
two
minister
and
acknowledge
deputy
Róisín
Shortall
's
singular
vision
in
create
the
motion
.
we
be
in
positive
mode
in
relation
to
the
potential
of
the
committee
and
will
engage
productively
with
it
.
I
welcome
the
tone
of
the
minister
's
speech
in
that
there
appear
to
be
a
genuine
willingness
to
engage
with
all
party
and
all
member
in
this
Dáil
in
seek
a
meeting
of
mind
on
how
we
can
figure
out
and
instigate
a
proper
vision
for
the
provision
of
health
care
into
the
future
.
if
we
be
honest
,
we
can
reasonably
assume
that
there
be
much
common
ground
between
we
on
the
need
of
citizen
.
there
have
to
be
a
particular
focus
on
the
continuum
of
care
as
between
primary
,
secondary
and
tertiary
care
.
the
one
question
I
have
on
the
creation
of
the
committee
be
how
it
will
dovetail
with
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
.
will
it
be
a
tool
of
government
policy
into
the
future
or
what
mandate
will
it
have
if
it
come
up
with
a
set
of
recommendation
that
do
not
tally
with
the
commitment
in
the
programme
for
government
,
of
which
there
be
many
?
give
that
approximately
€
13
billion
be
to
be
spend
this
year
alone
in
the
health
sector
and
consider
the
many
commitment
make
in
the
programme
for
government
from
primary
care
through
to
secondary
and
tertiary
care
,
include
mental
health
,
the
issue
of
resource
will
have
to
be
address
within
the
remit
of
the
committee
.
if
we
be
to
aspire
to
have
a
comprehensive
continuum
of
care
between
primary
,
secondary
and
tertiary
care
,
include
community
care
and
mental
health
service
provision
,
it
will
cost
a
good
deal
of
money
and
clear
choice
will
have
to
be
make
.
to
be
fair
to
he
,
the
minister
mention
this
in
he
contribution
when
he
refer
to
the
trade
-
off
between
efficiency
and
equity
and
comprehensiveness
and
cost
control
.
this
be
something
that
will
merit
further
interrogation
.
I
welcome
the
document
good
health
because
it
provide
a
good
template
and
set
out
the
parameter
within
which
we
be
operate
.
some
of
the
challenge
in
health
care
provision
include
the
fact
that
the
number
of
people
aged
over
85
year
in
Ireland
be
,
accord
to
CSO
estimate
,
increase
by
approximately
3.3
%
each
year
.
this
present
a
major
challenge
for
all
of
we
in
the
management
of
demographic
.
some
38
%
of
Irish
people
over
the
age
of
50
year
suffer
from
one
chronic
disease
.
Chronic
disease
account
for
80
%
of
all
gp
visit
,
40
%
of
hospital
admission
and
75
%
of
hospital
bed
day
.
the
minister
speak
strongly
about
focus
on
primary
care
and
try
to
intervene
as
much
as
possible
at
that
level
.
that
be
something
on
which
we
all
agree
.
the
aim
of
such
a
policy
should
seek
to
ensure
people
be
keep
out
of
tertiary
care
facility
for
as
long
as
possible
and
that
intervention
be
make
at
community
level
.
that
would
have
a
major
impact
in
patient
care
and
would
also
create
the
ability
to
reduce
cost
and
be
more
efficient
in
the
use
of
resource
.
on
the
flipside
,
it
would
require
a
massive
injection
of
capital
into
the
primary
care
system
.
if
we
be
to
manage
the
demographic
challenge
and
the
ongoing
challenge
in
chronic
care
service
,
as
I
have
outline
,
in
that
paradigm
primary
care
facility
will
need
resource
.
speak
as
a
former
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
,
the
last
government
create
a
health
innovation
hub
.
we
create
a
demonstrator
model
whereby
we
seek
to
utilise
the
good
research
that
exist
from
a
geographical
perspective
in
term
of
medical
device
and
service
.
we
seek
to
inculcate
the
thinking
that
exist
base
on
the
research
that
be
ongoing
within
we
academic
institution
as
a
means
of
seek
to
ensure
that
great
efficiency
.
I
be
not
sure
where
the
health
innovation
hub
stand
at
present
now
that
there
be
a
new
government
form
.
however
,
I
believe
that
innovation
and
engagement
with
stakeholder
in
the
academic
space
be
go
to
be
vital
.
we
will
need
a
proper
analysis
of
population
figure
and
a
sense
of
inculcate
some
of
the
thinking
that
exist
within
academic
institution
to
determine
how
we
be
go
to
provide
the
vision
that
be
necessary
.
I
believe
that
the
primary
care
centre
be
one
mechanism
by
which
we
could
link
up
with
academic
institution
to
try
to
drive
innovation
and
to
ensure
,
as
deputy
Kelleher
state
early
,
that
more
diagnostics
take
place
within
the
primary
care
setting
so
as
to
prevent
people
from
present
to
secondary
and
tertiary
care
facility
and
to
keep
they
at
home
for
long
.
the
datum
that
be
use
can
then
be
analyse
and
partner
with
medical
device
company
,
innovator
in
the
health
care
provision
space
or
academic
to
try
to
analyse
the
datum
so
that
we
can
then
produce
policy
outcome
that
deliver
the
efficiency
that
be
necessary
for
the
system
.
we
need
more
of
that
within
the
system
.
it
be
a
case
of
mainstream
that
into
the
system
because
currently
it
be
peripheral
.
we
need
to
have
a
great
interrogation
of
the
relationship
between
the
HSE
and
the
Department
of
Health
.
there
be
still
some
siloed
thinking
in
how
the
HSE
,
this
House
,
the
Department
of
Health
and
the
minister
interact
.
we
need
a
great
interrogation
of
that
relationship
to
ensure
that
there
be
more
transparency
around
it
.
we
also
need
to
look
at
why
there
be
a
constant
need
for
a
Supplementary
estimate
on
a
ongoing
basis
.
I
say
that
objectively
.
take
this
year
for
example
,
if
there
be
provision
make
at
the
start
of
the
year
for
€
13
billion
,
will
this
committee
have
a
remit
to
examine
and
interrogate
the
deployment
of
resource
more
closely
?
we
need
to
look
at
it
in
term
of
seek
efficiency
for
the
system
in
order
that
the
citizen
can
have
confidence
that
he
or
she
will
have
access
to
the
service
that
be
necessary
,
whether
he
or
she
present
to
a
gp
,
a
secondary
care
facility
or
a
tertiary
care
facility
.
we
need
to
look
at
the
whole
issue
of
health
insurance
and
we
need
to
talk
to
the
health
insurance
provider
.
we
need
to
look
at
why
there
be
spare
capacity
within
secondary
care
facility
,
such
as
Mallow
or
Ennis
,
where
more
elective
surgery
could
be
do
.
we
could
take
much
of
the
constraint
that
be
in
hospital
such
as
Cork
University
Hospital
and
radiate
more
service
out
to
secondary
care
facility
.
with
regard
to
mental
health
,
we
need
to
have
a
proper
discussion
on
how
a
Vision
for
Change
be
implement
and
resource
.
I
thank
the
deputy
for
he
good
wish
.
he
have
always
have
a
keen
interest
in
fishery
matter
.
in
previous
debate
on
the
matter
,
deputy
from
Malin
head
to
Mizen
head
and
from
Hook
head
to
Clogher
head
be
exercise
by
the
matter
.
the

colleague
and
my
party
colleague
,
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Joe
McHugh
,
also
contact
I
about
the
matter
.
as
I
say
to
the
various
principal
officer
I
meet
today
,
I
come
to
this
portfolio
with
not
a
mile
of
coast
in
my
constituency
.
maybe
in
some
regards
this
be
a
advantage
in
that
I
come
with
no
baggage
.
I
welcome
good
counsel
on
this
matter
and
deputy
Pringle
will
not
be
shy
in
mark
my
card
and
give
I
a
whisper
in
the
ear
if
I
need
assistance
on
this
matter
.
I
thank
the

which
give
I
a

much
of
the
scrutiny
regard
SI
125
of
2016
since
it
come
into
force
stem
from
the
fact
that
point
apply
separate
to
any
criminal
prosecution
or
conviction
or
where
a
prosecution
result
in
a
acquittal
.
it
have
be
suggest
that
the
EU
point
system
should
,
instead
,
be
combine
with
a
successful
prosecution
through
the
court
.
in
recent
week
,
there
have
be
a
number
of
meeting
between
I
,
my
predecessor
and
the
fishing
industry
with
regard
to
the
concern
raise
.
I
meet
with
representative
of
the
fishing
industry
this
morning
to
discuss
a
wide
range
of
issue
and
,
in
particular
,
they
concern
on
the
implementation
of
the
EU
point
system
.
on
take
office
,
I
request
that
the
Attorney
General
consider
whether
there
be
a
way
that
the
assignment
of
EU
point
for
the
licence
holder
can
await
the
completion
of
the
prosecution
process
while
at
the
same
time
ensure
Ireland
be
fully
in
compliance
with
its
obligation
under
EU
law
.
far
to
the
programme
for
government
commitment
pertain
to
the
assignment
of
point
,
I
quickly
seek
that
advice
from
the
Attorney
General
as
prescribe
in
the
document
.
have
receive
this
advice
,
I
be
satisfied
to
move
on
the
introduction
of
a
system
for
the
sequential
application
for
EU
point
in
conjunction
with
the
prosecution
process
,
thus
fulfil
the
ambition
outline
in
the
partnership
programme
and
go
to
the
heart
of
deputy
Pringle
's
concern
which
he
articulate
here
.
this
move
be
subject
to
address
some
important
legal
and
administrative
issue
in
order
to
ensure
compliance
with
EU
law
.
I
have
listen
to
the
concern
of
industry
and
intend
to
report
back
to
the
Oireachtas
as
soon
as
I
have
finalise
a
way
forward
in
the
context
of
deal
with
the
legal
and
administrative
matter
that
arise
.
however
,
I
be
confident
that
this
matter
can
be
deal
with
in
a
collaborative
and
constructive
manner
with
all
stakeholder
.
Irish
fisherman
should
be
assure
that
the
State
be
take
seriously
they
concern
that
a
fishing
industry
can
be
maintain
for
they
and
that
come
after
they
.
the
conservation
of
fishing
resource
be
in
everyone
's
interest
and
be
vital
for
the
future
of
the
Irish
fishing
industry
.
I
be
confident
that
the
reform
point
system
that
I
have
announce
will
play
a
vital
role
in
act
as
a
effective
sanction
against
the
minority
who
break
the
rule
,
protect
the
vast
majority
of
we
law
abide
industry
and
preserve
the
fishing
resource
for
all
fisherman
and
for
future
generation
.
this
be
a
citizen
's
assembly
.
my
first
question
relate
to
procedural
matter
.
I
put
down
a
parliamentary
question
to
the
Department
of
Health
last
week
and
I
have
be
tell
I
will
receive
a
response
from
the
HSE
within
15
day
.
I
be
always
give
to
understand
that
the
timeframe
be
ten
day
so
have
there
be
a
change
in
procedure
in
that
regard
?
I
will
do
so
but
I
be
put
it
on
the
record
of
the
House
today
.
when
will
we
see
the
consolidate
Book
of
estimate
?
have
the
revise
expenditure
benchmark
be
agree
with
the
European
Commission
?
there
be
a
issue
regard
the
working
of
the
House
.
I
will
take
that
on
board
.
I
thank
deputy
Haughey
for
raise
this
important
issue
.
I
note
neither
the
education
and
training
board
nor
the
Department
have
any
advance
notice
that
this
issue
be
likely
to
occur
.
the
City
of
Dublin
Education
and
Training
Board
have
be
work
with
target
for
a
long
time
and
,
as
the
deputy
note
,
it
have
be
provide
further
education
and
training
in
Donaghmede
for
more
than
20
year
.
it
be
locate
in
St.
Kevin
's
school
,
Newbrook
Road
,
Donaghmede
,
and
it
provide
a
wide
range
of
course
which
the
deputy
have
outline
and
I
do
not
believe
I
need
to
repeat
they
.
as
he
indicate
,
they
include
service
that
go
well
beyond
the
remit
of
the
Department
of
Education
and
Skill
into
counselling
,
child
care
and
many
community
service
but
it
be
support
specifically
in
respect
of
adult
education
provision
by
the
CDETB
.
I
be
aware
of
the
pressure
of
school
enrolment
on
St.
Kevin
's
junior
school
because
it
have
experience
a
57
%
increase
in
the
period
between
2011
and
2015
and
that
trend
be
continue
.
in
that
context
,
the
school
submit
a
application
in
June
2015
to
provide
for
the
refurbishment
of
exist
space
to
create
two
classroom
-
size
space
to
create
a
mainstream
classroom
and
a
resource
room
for
special
education
.
my
Department
examine
and
approve
that
application
and
the
funding
be
provide
.
this
late
decision
by
St.
Kevin's
,
which
have
write
to
target
inform
it
that
the
school
be
not
in
position
to
renew
the
lease
into
the
future
,
have
come
as
news
and
obviously
create
difficulty
for
target
in
continue
its
work
.
I
have
be
in
touch
with
the
CDETB
and
it
will
make
contact
with
representative
of
target
to
discuss
the
possible
option
,
bear
in
mind
the
pressure
that
exist
.
as
the
deputy
request
,
I
will
explore
what
solution
can
be
find
to
ascertain
whether
the
service
can
be
continue
,
as
it
have
be
deliver
a
valuable
service
for
a
considerable
time
and
the
notice
receive
have
be
extremely
abrupt
.
I
undertake
to
pursue
this
matter

I
welcome
the
fact
that
time
have
be
devote
today
for
statement
on
the
summer
economic
statement
.
if
I
may
make
a
request
,
I
ask
that
at
some
stage
time
be
provide
in
the
finance
committee
or
the
budgetary
control
committee
so
we
can
have
a
more
iterative
process
and
a
question
and
answer
process
to
interrogate
the
point
make
heretofore
on
the
macroeconomic
piece
of
the
economic
statement
and
the
microeconomic
element
.
if
we
take
some
of
the
point
make
on
the
universal
social
charge
,
there
be
a
difference
in
emphasis
between
the
party
.
in
its
manifesto
,
my
party
make
a
commitment
to
abolish
the
universal
social
charge
for
the
first
€
72000
of
a
individual
's
income
.
a
school
of
thought
seem
to
be
emerge
here
,
and
whether
there
be
common
ground
to
be
find
on
the
treatment
of
the
universal
social
charge
on
a
cross
-
party
basis
remain
to
be
see
.
as
I
say
,
we
need
to
have
a
more
iterative
process
in
committee
to
discuss
how
we
can
find
some
common
ground
on
this
.
I
wish
to
speak
specifically
on
the
summer
economic
statement
as
it
relate
to
next
year
.
I
do
not
want
to
go
too
far
beyond
next
year
,
give
the
political
ferment
we
be
in
at
present
.
I
acknowledge
the
projection
,
but
the
net
message
of
the
summer
economic
statement
be
that
approximately
€300
million
be
to
be
make
available
for
additional
tax
cut
and
approximately
€600
million
be
to
be
make
available
for
additional
expenditure
in
2017
.
the
Irish
fiscal
Advisory
Council
,
IFAC
,
have
describe
the
sum
as
a
contractional
one
.
the
ESRI
,
in
its
quarterly
economic
commentary
for
summer
2016
,
state
that
economic
growth
in
GNP
term
will
be
4.8
%
in
2016
and
4.3
%
in
2017
.
the
ESRI
have
report
a
indicative
slowdown
in
global
trade
and
point
to
the
uncertainty
surround
the
outcome
of
the
Brexit
referendum
as
have
a
adverse
impact
on
the
trade
sector
of
the
Irish
economy
.
the
ESRI
be
point
to
"
domestic
source
of
growth
,
investment
and
consumption
[
as
]
the
main
determinant
of
the
increase
expect
in
Irish
economic
activity
.
"
we
argue
at
the
last
election
for
a
ratio
of
2:1
between
investment
and
tax
reduction
.
this
seem
to
be
what
be
be
outline
in
the
summer
economic
statement
.
however
,
one
could
argue
for
a
good
ratio
in
order
to
deliver
on
the
indexation
of
welfare
payment
,
small
class
size
,
transport
infrastructure
,
health
care
and
so
on
.
consider
also
capital
investment
for
productive
purpose
,
be
they
broadband
,
school
or
road
.
if
the
government
set
up
a
rainy
day
fund
for
economic
downturn
or
externality
over
which
we
have
no
control
,
the
question
arise
as
to
whether
we
be
be
risk
averse
.
should
we
consider
invest
in
infrastructure
to
fund
economic
growth
instead
of
simply
leave
money
on
deposit
?
also
,
the
2:1
ratio
only
apply
after
the
rainy
day
fund
have
be
create
.
we
need
a
close
interrogation
of
what
the
fund
be
about
and
what
it
will
mean
.
a
more
detailed
analysis
of
the
issue
be
require
.
if
we
understand
the
proposal
of
the
rainy
day
fund
correctly
,
it
will
commit
€
1
billion
per
annum
between
2019
and
2021
.
when
will
proposal
be
tab
in
the
dáil
for
the
fund
's
creation
?
on
Tuesday
,
the
Taoiseach
tell
we
that
the
total
amount
available
to
the
government
over
the
next
five
year
be
a
estimate
cumulative
of
€
11.3
billion
.
the
space
for
2017
have
increase
to
approximately
€
1
billion
,
with
€
1.2
billion
available
in
2018
.
this
be
the
suppose
logic
for
bring
forward
spending
in
2017
for
"
infrastructure
and
social
issue
"
,
to
quote
the
Taoiseach
from
Tuesday
.
I
do
not
want
to
spend
too
much
time
discuss
the
projection
beyond
2017
,
but
we
welcome
that
relate
to
the
increase
in
capital
expenditure
.
we
wonder
whether
we
could
be
more
ambitious
in
that
regard
with
a
view
to
expansionary
economic
activity
.
since
my
colleague
have
discuss
the
public
sector
pay
element
and
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
,
I
do
not
want
to
dwell
too
much
on
they
,
but
we
in
the
committee
debate
the
2016
estimate
yesterday
and
it
be
we
view
that
,
if
the
promise
of
a
new
budgetary
architecture
be
to
mean
anything
in
term
of
a
truly
collaborative
approach
to
governance
where
the
primacy
of
this
House
superseede
that
of
the
executive
,
there
must
be
a
good
consultative
process
for
budget
2017
.
if
the
House
rise
in
July
and
return
in
the
autumn
,
the
space
for
such
a
discussion
be
limit
.
we
want
to
interrogate
further
whether
there
be
common
ground
to
be
have
between
party
on
budget
2017
,
particularly
regard
the
taxation
on
work
side
.
we
feel
that
there
be
great
scope
for
more
capital
expenditure
.
although
we
acknowledge
the
increase
,
there
be
a
positive
multiplier
effect
.
the
programme
for
government
include
clear
commitment
on
regional
economic
growth
and
target
for
the
number
of
job
that
it
seek
to
create
outside
of
the
Dublin
area
.
if
one
be
realistic
about
that
job
creation
,
though
,
one
need
a
Atlantic
corridor
strategy
that
link
the
three
main
city
beyond
Dublin
,
namely
,
Cork
,
Limerick
and
Galway
.
issue
of
connectivity
between
the
three
must
be
consider
,
include
capital
expenditure
on
road
infrastructure
,
if
the
job
creation
target
of
130000
plus
outside
of
Dublin
be
to
be
achieve
during
the
lifetime
of
this
government
.
we
need
to
get
away
from
the
anachronistic
policy
provision
whereby
there
be
a
increase
in
expenditure
every
year
via
a
revise
estimate
present
to
the
House
relate
to
,
for
instance
,
health
.
we
be
all
of
the
view
that
,
if
a
department
be
allocate
a
amount
of
money
for
a
year
,
justify
a
revise
estimate
for
same
should
be
difficult
if
the
people
within
the
Department
have
already
make
spending
projection
.
we
go
through
this
choreography
and
pageantry
around
revise
estimate
every
year
.
if
we
be
to
examine
performance
and
reform
within
the
public
sector
,
we
must
determine
how
to
move
away
from
the
architecture
of
revise
estimate
.
if
we
be
consider
budgetary
arithmetic
in
a
truly
collaborative
fashion
,
we
should
seek
to
ensure
that
Department
have
enough
money
to
do
the
job
that
they
need
to
do
.
we
must
be
a
bit
more
lateral
in
we
thinking
.
the
summer
economic
statement
be
a
point
-
in
-
time
assessment
of
where
we
stand
now
and
speak
to
the
challenge
ahead
.
we
must
devote
more
time
in
committee
to
delv
into
how
the
multi-annual
expenditure
ceiling
will
operate
,
how
the
publication
of
the
update
public
spending
code
will
operate
and
what
the
establishment
of
the
Irish
government
economic
and
evaluation
Service
,
IGEES
,
mean
to
the
allocation
of
public
money
in
term
of
great
level
of
transparency
and
efficiency
.
evidence
-
base
decision
making
so
as
to
ensure
that
we
spend
public
money
in
way
that
will
be
of
maximum
benefit
to
the
people
of
Ireland
be
vital
.
the
summer
economic
statement
make
reference
to
the
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
.
it
be
propose
that
the
minimum
wage
be
increase
to
€
10.50
per
hour
over
the
next
five
year
.
I
hope
that
we
could
have
a
further
discussion
about
this
proposal
in
committee
.
for
example
,
how
be
the
low
pay
Commission
propose
to
operate
?
the
Labour
Party
have
argue
for
a
living
wage
and
have
clear
proposal
on
how
this
can
be
achieve
.
to
we
mind
,
the
sum
of
€
10.50
after
five
year
be
not
where
we
want
to
go
,
give
that
the
House
pass
a
motion
on
1
June
that
support
the
call
for
a
programme
of
incremental
increase
in
the
national
minimum
wage
until
it
be
peg
at
60
%
of
median
earnings
and
for
a
living
wage
of
€
11.50
per
hour
to
be
adopt
throughout
the
public
sector
.
there
be
a
clear
statement
by
the
House
,
agree
by
all
party
,
that
contradict
the
summer
economic
statement
.
if
we
be
in
the
paradigm
of
new
politics
,
we
must
respect
the
fact
that
there
be
a
clear
motion
that
be
the
majority
view
.
I
want
to
return
to
the
question
of
the
low
pay
Commission
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Donohoe
,
make
a
very
specific
reference
to
public
service
pay
.
he
remind
the
House
that
"
the
programme
for
government
contain
a
specific
commitment
to
establish
a
public
service
pay
commission
to
examine
pay
level
across
the
public
service
,
include
entry
level
of
pay
.
"
we
welcome
that
proposal
.
we
await
the
detail
of
the
establishment
of
the
low
pay
Commission
.
it
be
fair
to
ask
when
the
commission
will
be
establish
.
what
will
its
exact
remit
be
?
how
will
it
be
constitute
?
will
it
include
member
of
the
trade
union
movement
?
how
be
it
propose
to
deal
with
entry
level
of
pay
?
I
echo
the
point
make
by
deputy
Calleary
early
with
regard
to
the
statement
make
today
by
gardaí
on
restoration
of
pay
for
new
entrant
.
it
be
important
that
we
deal
with
this
issue
and
find
a
mechanism
through
which
a
positive
outcome
can
be
achieve
for
new
entrant
.
I
would
welcome
a
further
discussion
on
the
local
investment
fund
at
the
relevant
line
committee
.
we
need
a
further
interrogation
of
what
this
€200
million
fund
will
deliver
in
2017
.
it
be
not
entirely
clear
how
individual
local
authority
will
compete
for
this
remarkable
pot
of
money
.
I
think
we
have
to
acknowledge
the
increase
in
capital
expenditure
.
we
would
like
to
interrogate
further
with
the
line
minister
each
of
the
point
raise
here
today
.
perhaps
that
can
happen
on
a
cross
-party
basis
as
part
of
a
iterative
process
.
we
need
to
move
beyond
the
tribe
.
if
the
paradigm
shift
in
relation
to
how
we
do
business
in
this
house
be
to
be
meaningful
,
we
must
take
a
collaborative
approach
to
reach
consensus
on
policy
provision
.
in
accordance
with
standing
Order
70
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday
,
30
June
2016
.
the
deputy
be
on
the
same
side
as
the
Tories
.
my
question
be
on
the
same
issue
relate
to
Thursday
.
could
time
be
make
available
in
respect
of
the
obligatory
report
on
the
continuation
or
not
of
the
FEMPI
legislation
?
it
be
pertinent
at
this
time
.
in
accordance
with
standing
Order
70
(
2
)
,
the
division
be
postpone
until
the
weekly
division
time
on
Thursday
,
30
June
2016
.
in

Order

,
the
division

division
time
on
Thursday
,
30
June

.
it
be
Leinster
House
now
,
be
it
?
but
what
be
go
to
be
roll
out
be
.
finance
by
the
taxpayer
.
I
welcome
the
motion
before
the
House
.
I
have
some
technical
question
to
ask
and
will
also
request
a
further
discussion
on
this
issue
here
to
discuss
the
more
technical
aspect
of
this
plan
.
perhaps
that
could
be
do
outside
the
committee
structure
because
every
member
of
the
House
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
issue
and
,
while
not
necessarily
be
member
of
the
relevant
committee
,
they
may
be
spokesperson
in
that
area
.
that
be
the
new
paradigm
we
be
in
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
option
that
be
place
before
the
minister
be
whittle
down
to
two
.
the
first
,
which
the
government
choose
,
be
the
commercial
stimulus
or
gap
-
funding
model
whereby
the
private
sector
finances
,
design
,
build
,
own
and
operate
the
network
.
there
be
contractual
obligation
within
that
model
.
second
,
there
be
the
full
concession
model
whereby
the
private
sector
again
finances
,
design
,
build
and
operate
the
network
,
but
the
asset
be
hand
back
to
the
State
after
25
year
.
my
understanding
be
that
go
for
the
full
concession
model
,
involve
a
reversion
of
the
asset
back
to
the
State
after
25
year
,
would
have
have
implication
in
put
the
entire
cost
of
the
project
on
balance
sheet
.
there
would
therefore
have
be
a
impact
on
fiscal
space
.
I
do
not
hear
the
minister
's
open
remark
but
I
think
he
refer
to
deputy
Howlin
's
early
intervention
about
certain
choice
that
have
to
be
make
by
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
.
I
will
not
get
into
a
political
tit
for
tat
on
that
.
however
,
the
logic
of
opt
for
the
fully
privatise
or
gap
-
funding
model
be
that
the
fiscal
space
would
not
be
cover
by
the
Exchequer
's
capital
funding
envelope
.
I
be
seek
a
discussion
on
the
KPMG
report
which
advise
the
gap
-
funding
model
.
what
be
the
legal
advice
in
real
term
for
opt
against
the
full
concession
model
?
I
be
tell
-
and
,
to
be
fair
,
the
Department
have
be
open
about
this
-
that
the
full
concession
model
be
deem
to
be
significantly
more
complex
from
a
contractual
perspective
.
in
addition
,
it
would
take
six
month
or
possibly
long
to
negotiate
a
contract
.
one
try
to
be
as
factual
as
one
can
but
if
one
go
to
a
company
like
KPMG
,
or
another
external
adviser
in
the
private
sector
,
on
the
law
of
average
they
be
not
necessarily
go
to
say
that
one
should
come
back
with
a
model
that
revert
the
asset
back
to
the
State
after
25
year
.
that
be
why
I
want
to
have
a
further
discussion
on
this
matter
which
warrant
further
investigation
.
the
KPMG
report
present
argument
in
favour
of
the
commercial
stimulus
model
.
a
departmental
document
state
that
this
model
place
all
the
technology
and
demand
risk
on
the
private
sector
,
while
cost
the
Exchequer
less
.
in
addition
,
the
asset
will
rely
extensively
on
commercially
-
own
third
-
party
asset
which
will
not
be
within
the
control
of
government
.
that
be
one
of
the
consideration
which
warrant
further
discussion
.
there
be
cross-party
support
for
this
motion
and
we
all
have
myriad
example
in
we
own
constituency
.
however
,
anything
we
do
now
could
be
surpass
by
new
technology
in
the
provision
of
broadband
.
we
do
not
know
what
kind
of
technology
will
exist
in
25
year
's
time
.
I
be
not
breach
the
minister
's
confidence
in
say
that
we
have
a
discussion
on
this
matter
previously
;
it
be
a
open
conversation
.
if
new
infrastructure
be
be
create
and
the
State
be
invest
in
it
,
a
more
conservative
view
would
be
to
retain
the
network
in
State
ownership
because
we
do
not
know
what
will
happen
technologically
downstream
.
that
would
be
a
more
cautious
approach
.
be
there
be
a
mechanism
to
have
a
discussion
here
on
how
we
would
fund
the
cost
of
the
full
concession
model
over
a
long
period
than
the
five
or
six
year
we
be
talk
about
?
we
can
only
talk
in
limited
term
about
the
future
fiscal
space
but
if
the
capital
envelope
go
from
approximately
€
275
million
up
to
€600
million
,
which
may
be
the
true
cost
,
be
there
room
for
such
a
discussion
?
this
be
particularly
relevant
give
we
relationship
with
the
EU
at
present
and
give
the
new
political
reality
that
exist
with
the
EU
.
I
know
the
minister
will
say
that
this
would
slow
down
the
process
.
I
do
appreciate
that
point
and
I
be
not
try
to
score
political
point
.
I
note
deputy
Stanley
's
reference
to
a
Labour
U
-
turn
,
but
in
fact
there
be
no
U
-
turn
on
this
.
we
be
,
however
,
try
to
have
as
broad
a
discussion
as
possible
so
that
we
can
future
-
proof
what
we
be
create
now
.
in
that
way
,
we
will
not
give
something
away
which
we
might
have
be
able
,
with
foresight
,
to
retain
as
a
public
asset
.
that
be
the
logic
of
what
I
be
propose
.
however
,
we
will
support
the
amendment
.
give
that
the
scheme
have
now
be
announce
and
agree
at
cabinet
,
I
do
not
know
if
the
scheme
have
any
legal
standing
beyond
the
fact
that
the
Parliament
will
make
its
own
voice
hear
on
this
issue
.
the
scheme
will
proceed
as
agree
by
the
government
in
the
final
analysis
.
nonetheless
,
there
be
a
opportunity
to
have
a
more
detailed
discussion
about
the
KPMG
aspect
,
and
the
full
concession
model
versus
the
gap
-
funding
model
.
I
would
like
we
to
have
that
discussion
in
a
more
detailed
forum
.
the
select
Committee
on
Justice
and
Equality
have
complete
its
consideration
of
the
Paternity
leave
and
Benefit
Bill
2016
and
have
make
amendment
thereto
.

there

at

early
.
I
say
this
as
much
to
be

in
conclusion
-
I
be
within
the
timeframe
-
and
on
a
serious
note
I
wish
to
inform
the
House
that
there
be
a
fire
at
the
Patrician
Academy
post
-
primary
school
in
the
early
hour
of
this
morning
.
will
the
Taoiseach
and
the
Minister
for
Education
and
Skill
make
all
resource
available
to
ensure
that
temporary
accommodation
will
be
set
up
in
advance
of
the
school
year
in
September
and
that
all
resource
be
deploy
?
I
be
delighted
to
be
able
to
raise
this
matter
.
today
,
at
3
a.m.
,
a
serious
fire
engulf
the
Patrician
Academy
post
-
primary
boy
's
school
in
Mallow
,
County
Cork
.
it
cause
extensive
damage
to
the
administrative
block
,
science
lab
,
technical
draw
and
woodwork
room
and
computer
facility
.
the
building
date
from
1886
.
the
school
be
establish
by
the
Patrician
Brother
and
have
since
be
laicise
.
the
fire
cause
such
extensive
damage
that
adjoin
residential
premise
be
evacuate
in
the
early
hour
of
the
morning
.
in
the
meantime
the
Garda
have
confirm
that
a
technical
examination
of
the
site
be
under
way
.
in
raise
the
matter
I
recognise
that
it
will
take
considerable
time
to
move
to
construction
phase
and
that
people
be
still
get
over
the
shock
of
what
happen
last
night
.
the
school
community
still
feel
very
raw
about
it
,
but
I
ask
the
Minister
for
Education
,
deputy
Richard
Bruton
,
once
the
school
community
,
the
principal
and
the
board
of
management
make
formal
contact
with
the
Department
,
if
emergency
accommodation
can
be
provide
in
advance
of
the
start
of
the
new
school
year
in
September
.
Parent
,
the
principal
,
the
teacher
and
the
community
be
very
anxious
not
to
be
leave
without
at
least
temporary
accommodation
,
particularly
for
that
student
who
will
be
face
into
state
examination
from
September
onwards
.
I
be
,
therefore
,
raise
the
issue
to
ask
that
this
resource
be
make
available
.
I
acknowledge
that
the
Secretary
General
of
the
Department
speak
to
I
today
about
the
matter
.
I
recognise
that
there
be
quite
a
number
of
issue
that
will
have
to
be
go
through
,
include
insurance
,
investigation
,
etc.
,
but
I
be
hopeful
the
Department
will
prioritise
this
project
.
we
acknowledge
that
there
have
be
a
considerable
degree
of
capital
investment
in
the
school
in
the
recent
past
,
include
the
provision
of
a
autism
unit
,
as
well
as
additional
classroom
.
I
be
hopeful
,
therefore
,
that
at
least
in
the
short
term
,
pend
further
planning
for
the
rebuild
and
future
-
proofing
of
the
school
,
emergency
accommodation
will
be
provide
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
,
once
the
school
make
formal
contact
with
the
Department
,
the
matter
will
be
expedite
.
I
be
very
grateful
to
the
minister
for
he
response
and
he
official
for
the
contact
that
have
be
make
with
the
school
authority
,
particularly
the
school
principal
,
Ms
Catherine
Fitzpatrick
.
I
also
acknowledge
the
fact
that
official
will
undertake
a
site
visit
,
which
be
to
be
welcome
.
I
thank
the
minister
for
he
proactive
response
and
I
be
assure
by
he
statement
that
provision
will
be
make
for
the
emergency
or
temporary
accommodation
that
will
be
necessary
from
September
onwards
.
I
thank
the
Ceann
Comhairle
.
if
the
unaligned
deputy
present
themselves
,
I
will
be
happy
to
share
time
with
they
.
I
have
no
hesitation
in
agree
that
au
pair
hosting
be
a
valuable
tradition
.
it
can
benefit
both
host
family
and
young
foreign
visitor
who
be
help
in
a
domestic
environment
to
improve
language
skill
and
enjoy
a
positive
cultural
experience
.
none
of
we
want
to
undermine
the
viability
of
genuine
au
pair
arrangement
,
but
we
must
recognise
there
be
two
side
to
this
story
.
not
all
experience
be
mutually
beneficial
.
we
must
also
recognise
that
this
Bill
,
no
matter
how
it
be
present
,
be
aim
at
remove
statutory
protection
that
be
currently
enjoy
.
until
now
,
au
pair
have
not
be
treat
as
a
separate
category
of
worker
in
we
employment
law
.
if
there
be
a
agreement
to
do
work
,
regardless
of
what
title
one
give
the
worker
,
he
or
she
be
entitle
to
the
benefit
of
we
employment
protection
law
,
include
on
the
national
minimum
wage
.
a
realistic
debate
on
this
issue
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
on
the
ground
.
it
seem
clear
that
in
many
case
au
pair
be
be
use
as
underpaid
domestic
worker
because
of
we
crisis
in
child
care
provision
.
for
example
,
last
year
's
survey
by
migrant
Right
Centre
Ireland
show
a
age
profile
for
au
pair
that
do
not
match
the
popular
perception
.
it
show
that
37
%
have
no
contract
at
all
and
40
%
a
verbal
contract
only
.
some
20
%
have
pay
a
fee
to
get
the
job
,
38
%
be
expect
to
work
more
than
originally
agree
,
31
%
have
be
ask
to
work
when
they
be
sick
,
58
%
be
pay
€
120
or
less
per
week
,
one
in
ten
do
not
have
she
own
bedroom
,
and
one
in
five
be
expect
to
be
on
call
at
night
.
a
balance
be
need
here
.
on
the
one
hand
,
au
pair
relationship
be
unique
and
deserve
to
be
foster
.
I
agree
that
the
allowance
for
provide
board
and
lodging
,
which
can
be
deduct
from
the
minimum
wage
but
which
be
last
properly
examine
in
2000
,
need
to
be
review
urgently
.
on
the
other
hand
,
I
do
not
believe
the
good
way
to
regularise
activity
in
the
sector
be
simply

basis
from

one
should
remember
that
,
traditionally
understand
,
au

here
primarily
to
improve
they
English
.
they
stay
here
as
language
student
and
the
domestic
setting
be
a
adjunct
to
the
time
spend
in
a
language
school
or
college
.
it
be
important
to
bear
this
in
mind
when
consider
how
much
time
a
au
pair
should
be
require
to
devote
to
what
this
Bill
describe
as
"
light

"

section
2
(

)
(
b
)
of
the
legislation
state
a
criterion
for
placement
be
that
one
''
be
a
non-citizen
of
the
EU
ordinarily
resident
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
with
a
student
entry
visa
as
prescribe
by
ministerial
Order
under
the
Immigration
Act
2004
.
"
we
immigration
law
restrict
part
-
time
student
to
work
no
more
than
20
hour
per
week
.
I
see
no
reason
we
should
expect
au
pair
to
work
long
than
other
student
for
less
pay
in
a
entirely
unprotected
statutory
environment
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
study
that
bring
they
here
in
the
first
place
.
the
objective
of
the
Bill
be
inadequate
.
for
example
,
it
propose
a
au
pair
accreditation
council
to
perform
important
statutory
function
but
it
do
not
make
any
provision
in
respect
of
the
membership
of
the
council
,
who
get
to
appoint
the
member
and
to
whom
they
be
accountable
.
the
Bill
do
not
explicitly
state
au
pair
be
exempt
from
minimum
wage
legislation
,
which
I
presume
be
its
central
purpose
and
the
reason
for
the
reference
to
''
pocket
money
''
.
there
be
so
many
question
raise
but
leave
unanswered
by
this
Bill
that
my
party
and
I
cannot
support
it
.
it
seem
to
we
to
be
design
more
to
meet
the
demand
of
that
in
the
au
pair
sector
who
want
light
alternative
regulation
rather
than
register
as
employment
agency
than
it
be
design
to
meet
the
need
of
family
or
au
pair
themselves
.
perhaps
the
deputy
who
be
propose
the
Bill
might
respond
to
that
.
I
do
not
make
that
point
as
a
charge
.
we
be
all
inherently
in
favour
of
what
the
sector
deliver
for
family
and
the
au
pair
themselves
in
term
of
the
experience
they
gain
.
however
,
we
want
to
ensure
we
have
the
right
motive
when
present
legislation
of
this
nature
.
it
may
be
that
wholesale
amendment
could
improve
the
Bill
but
we
would
not
in
any
circumstance
support
a
legislative
regime
bring
in
simply
to
ensure
foreign
au
pair
could
be
use
in
a
unprotected
way
as
a
resource
to
meet
a
need
that
be
not
be
meet
within
the
domestic
labour
market

in
the
few
minute
available
,
I
wish
to
crystallise
my
interpretation
of
this
issue
as
good
I
can
.
I
represent
part
of
the
county
of
Cork
and
many
of
my
constituent
work
for
Apple
.
there
be
no
doubt
,
base
on
the
feedback
I
have
receive
,
that
there
be
concern
for
the
long
-
term
future
of
Apple
and
other
FDI
company
locate
in
the
Cork
region
in
particular
.
there
be
concern
about
the
possible
effect
of
the
commission
's
ruling
on
long
-
term
investment
on
Irish
soil
and
on
we
ability
to
sustain
the
employment
that
already
exist
not
only
in
Cork
but
also
throughout
the
republic
as
a
whole
.
member
must
distinguish
between
what
be
interpret
as
a
breach
of
state
aid
rule
,
on
one
hand
,
and
a
overreaching
by
the
European
Commission
into
the
sovereign
affair
of
a
member
state
on
a
matter
of
taxation
policy
,
on
the
other
.
I
have
be
try
to
get
to
the
nub
of
the
issue
and
there
be
a
very
good
blog
post
by
Mr.
Tony
Connelly
of
RTE
which
outline
what
be
at
play
here
.
he
argue
that
for
a
tax
concession
such
as
that
give
to
Apple
to
qualify
as
illegal
state
aid
,
four
criterion
must
be
fulfil
.
the
aid
"
must
be
provide
by
the
state
and
finance
by
state
resource
"
-
that
be
questionable
.
it
must
"
grant
advantage
"
.
do
it
grant
advantage
to
other
company
in
a
similar
sector
?
the
advantage
must
be
"
selective
"
,
that
be
,
"
it
go
to
one
company
or
one
category
of
company
with
a
specific
commercial
activity
,
and
not
to
other
"
.
finally
,
it
must
"
distort
competition
and
trade
within
the
EU
"
.
if
it
do
not
meet
that
four
criterion
,
then
arguably
,
the
ruling
should
fall
and
there
be
question
around
whether
that
criterion
be
be
apply
objectively
as
they
relate
to
the
treaty
of
the
European
Union
.
I
wish
to
refer
briefly
to
the
US
Treasury
Department
's
white
paper
,
which
be
issue
on
24
August
and
which
be
entitle
,
the
European
Commission
's
Recent
State
Aid
Investigation
of
transfer
pricing
Rulings
.
this
document
make
the
follow
very
pertinent
point
:
there
be
the
possibility
that
any
repayment
order
by
the
commission
will
be
consider
foreign
income
tax
that
be
creditable
against
U.S.
tax
owe
by
the
company
in
the
Unite
State
.
if
so
,
the
company
'
U.S.
tax
liability
would
be
reduce
dollar
for
dollar
by
this
recovery
when
they
offshore
earnings
be
repatriate
or
treat
as
repatriate
as
part
of
possible
U.S.
tax
reform
.
to
the
extent
that
such
foreign
tax
be
impose
on
income
that
should
not
have
be
attributable
to
the
relevant
Member
State
,
that
outcome
be
deeply
troubling
,
as
it
would
effectively
constitute
a
transfer
of
revenue
to
the
EU
from
the
U.S.
government
and
its
taxpayer
.
it
go
on
to
say
:
adopt
new
enforcement
regime
with
retroactive
effect
will
hinder
company
's
ability
to
assess
risk
and
plan
for
the
future
,
and
set
a
unwelcome
precedent
for
tax
authority
around
the
world
to
take
similar
retroactive
action
that
could
affect
U.S.
and
EU
company
alike
.
it
also
undermine
the
G20
agenda
to
improve
tax
certainty
.
there
be
a
battleground
here
and
that
battleground
be
Ireland
.
this
country
be
be
use
as
a
battleground
between
the
European
Union
and
the
Unite
State
of
America
to
see
who
can
give
effect
to
the
issue
of
global
tax
justice
and
transparency
.
it
be
we
contention
that
the
only
reasonable
and
logical
thing
to
do
be
to
be
join
in
a
appeal
of
this
decision
.
there
be
a
pertinent
political
point
here
as
to
whether
the
commission
be
perceive
to
be
reach
into
the
sovereignty
of
a
member
state
in
the
area
of
taxation
policy
.
there
be
precedent
here
where
taxation
have
be
or
could
be
deem
to
have
be
use
as
a
state
-
aid
tool
and
there
be
establish
case
in
that
regard
,
for
example
,
one
involve
the
Spanish
bank
Santander
.
Europe
be
move
to
the
extreme
right
at
present
and
while
Ireland
,
as
a
nation
,
have
always
be
vehemently
pro-European
,
there
be
a
perception
that
the
European
Commission
be
overreach
in
this
particular
case
.
the
Revenue
commissioner
have
state
clearly
that
there
be
no
departure
from
the
applicable
Irish
tax
law
.
there
be
some
in
this
House
who
do
not
want
to
believe
the
chairman
of
the
Revenue
commissioner
and
that
be
fair
enough
,
particularly
if
they
want
to
make
a
political
point
in
that
regard
.
I
accept
the
statement
by
the
Chairman
of
the
Revenue
commissioner
.
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
the
Revenue
be
a
independent
statutory
body
,
we
should
make
this
appeal

move

the

this
House
that
it
be
for
pay
increase
;
it
be
for
a
hard
fight
for
restoration
of
pay
by
the
former
Minister
for
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
deputy
Brendan
Howlin
.
this
be
a
budget
that
misdirect
resource
in
its
scatter
-
gun
approach
.
it
provide
a
additional
€
50
million
plus
for
child
care
service
and
over
€
25
million
for
a
sheep
scheme
.
it
do
very
little
by
way
of
a
impact
on
child
care
.
I
refer
to
deputy
Joan
Burton
's
contribution
and
what
could
have
be
do
in
that
regard
.
the
Labour
Party
's
budget
submission
be
cost
on
the
basis
of
the
parameter
provide
for
last
week
,
notwithstand
the
additional
€200
million
that
have
be
find
.
for
example
,
as
propose
in
the
Labour
Party
's
submission
,
for
a
additional
€
177
million
we
could
have
a
universal
child
care
scheme
for
child
under
12
year
,
at
a
cost
of
€
71
million
,
and
a
cap
on
the
cost
to
parent
at
€
4.25
per
hour
for
up
to
40
hour
a
week
.
this
would
have
a
real
impact
.
what
we
have
instead
be
a
opaque
scheme
,
subject
to
publication
of
the
detail
,
which
provide
for
subsidise
child
care
from
September
2017
for
parent
earn
under
€
47000
,
up
to
a
figure
of
€
8,000
for
child
from
six
month
to
15
year
old
,
and
a
€900
subsidy
for
that
on
a
combine
income
above
€
47000
.
if
the
budgetary
process
be
to
mean
anything
,
this
detail
should
have
be
furnish
to
we
.
if
we
be
about
ensure
a
more
collaborative
dáil
in
check
the
power
of
the
cabinet
,
we
should
have
have
the
real
detail
in
order
to
engage
in
a
critique
of
it
today
and
receive
a
early
response
in
that
regard
.
the
additional
spend
of
€
35
million
on
child
care
service
be
not
very
imaginative
when
one
consider
that
,
as
I
say
,
€
25
million
be
be
provide
for
the
sheep
sector
.
this
speak
to
the
imbalance
in
the
government
's
priority
.
the
minister
do
not
refer
to
upskil
that
involve
in
the
child
care
sector
.
within
the
envelope
of
€
177
million
he
could
,
for
example
,
have
create
a
living
wage
of
€
11.50
per
hour
for
all
child
care
worker
,
at
a
cost
of
€
62
million
approximately
.
he
could
also
have
provide
for
a
additional
four
week
of
paternity
leave
,
at
a
cost
of
€
42
million
.
the
Labour
Party
propose
a
set
of
measure
which
,
instead
of
provide
for
a
piecemeal
reduction
in
the
USC
that
will
have
no
real
knock
-
on
effect
in
quality
of
life
for
people
,
would
have
enable
the
government
to
invest
taxpayer
hard
earn
tax
in
the
delivery
of
a
more
comprehensive
child
care
sector
which
would
have
provide
for
the
upskilling
of
worker
,
proper
wage
for
that
within
the
sector
,
opportunity
to
engage
in
continue
professional
development
and
for
a
great
degree
of
universality
.
I
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
degree
of
universality
in
what
the
minister
be
propose
,
but
we
want
to
see
the
detail
.
it
would
have
be
good
to
have
have
they
immediately
.
budget
2016
provide
for
a
increase
in
the

last
year
the
Labour
Party
be
excoriate
in
every

by
Fianna

for
have
only
give
old
age
pensioner
a
miserly
€
3
extra
in
they
pension
payment
.
when
one
weigh
up
the
increase
in
the
Christmas
bonus
and
look
at
the
€
3
increase
for
that
on
the
pension
,
it
amount
to
a
increase
over
a
full
52
week
of
€
271
.
person
from
Fianna
Fáil
go
out
and
do
battle
for
the
€5
increase
.
the
net
result
of
this
Fianna
Fáil
-
Fine
Gael
budget
will
be
a
total
net
increase
,
when
one
add
in
the
Christmas
bonus
and
the
€
5
from
1
March
,
of
€245
.
in
fact
,
the
cumulative
or
net
increase
in
2017
be
less
than
the
net
increase
in
2016
.
that
be
not
take
into
account
the
increase
in
the
fuel
allowance
last
year
,
which
I
see
no
evidence
of
this
year
.
let
we
look
at
health
.
where
be
the
money
that
will
follow
a
Vision
for
Change
?
where
be
the
money
for
mental
health
?
the
former
minister
of
State
,
Kathleen
Lynch
,
do
battle
internally
and
with
we
friend
in
Fine
Gael
to
protect
a
mental
health
budget
but
I
see
no
real
monetary
mention
of
in
this
budget
today
.
let
we
look
at
what
the
Labour
Party
would
have
provide
for
€375
million
.
we
would
have
reduce
prescription
charge
.
we
would
have
look
at
the
recruitment
of
early
intervention
team
for
all
child
with
disability
.
we
would
have
put
in
place
a
extra
780
staff
across
the
discipline
every
year
to
clear
the
backlog
.
we
would
have
employ
more
occupational
therapist
.
we
would
have
put
€
18.2
million
into
home
care
package
and
build
out
a
extra
1.3
million
home
help
hour
at
a
cost
of
€
20
million
.
we
see
no
evidence
of
real
increase
in
the
number
of
home
help
hour
provide
by
this
government
.
we
do
not
know
what
to
tell
people
who
be
care
for
other
.
if
they
look
at
the
budget
,
they
will
find
nothing
in
it
of
benefit
to
they
.
that
be
extremely
disappointing
.
I
refer
to
mental
health
early
.
we
would
have
provide
€
7
million
for
good
mental
health
,
which
would
have
provide
more
access
to
counselling
for
16
to
25
year
old
.
we
would
have
extend
the
Jigsaw
programme
to
five
further
location
at
a
cost
of
€
4
million
and
we
would
have
ring
-
fence
mental
health
funding
.
for
€
200000
,
the
government
could
have
hire
25
specialist
suicide
prevention
nurse
.
we
be
not
see
evidence
of
that
in
this
budget
today
.
we
do
not
even
see
a
nod
towards
the
issue
of
mental
health
in
term
of
real
and
concrete
proposal
.
do
we
have
to
wait
for
the
national
service
plan
,
of
which
the
HSE
have
ownership
through
the
Department
of
Health
,
for
that
?
what
we
would
have
love
to
have
see
be
some
degree
of
exploration
of
the
vision
around
mental
health
from
either
of
the
Minister
who
speak
.
deputy
Joan
Burton
refer
to
sport
,
which
be
inherently
tie
to
mental
health
.
if
one
look
at
the
figure
of
the
Department
of
Public
Expenditure
and
Reform
,
one
see
a
actual
net
decrease
in
the
investment
in
sport
.
the
minister
say
he
be
go
to
announce
a
sport
capital
scheme
.
while
such
a
scheme
would
be
very
welcome
in
most
community
throughout
the
country
,
it
can
only
go
so
far
.
we
must
align
a
great
degree
of
investment
in
sport
,
include
minority
sport
,
with
mental
health
.
we
must
also
ensure
that
a
vision
for
change
be
implement
in
full
.
let
we
look
at
health
in
the
round
.
there
be
€
15
million
for
the
National
treatment
purchase
Fund
,
which
be
a
negligible
figure
.
I
wonder
if
it
will
really
have
a
impact
on
waiting
list
.
there
be
only
€
10
million
for
950
home
care
package
,
58
transitional
care
bed
,
expansion
of
the
community
intervention
team
and
55
acute
bed
.
that
will
not
clear
the
backlog
.
it
will
have
no
impact
at
all
in
real
term
and
it
go
to
the
point
I
make
at
the
outset
of
my
intervention
that
if
one
spread
oneself
too
thinly
and
try
to
be
all
thing
to
all
people
,
one
will
deliver
nothing
in
term
of
real
impact
for
the
vast
majority
on
the
ground
.
if
the
budget
have
focus
on
significant
investment
in
child
care
,
it
would
not
have
pleased
all
the
people
but
it
would
at
least
have
go
some
way
towards
effect
societal
change
.
it
would
have
go
back
to
the
idea
that
people
should
derive
some
benefit
from
the
hard
-
earn
tax
they
pay
.
they
be
not
feel
that
now
.
let
we
look
at
education
.
there
be
provision
for
680
new
teacher
to
meet
demographic
demand
.
that
be
not
new
and
,
as
such
,
I
would
not
be
trumpet
it
as
a
innovative
measure
.
more
teacher
be
need
as
the
population
increase
in
any
event
.
there
be
provision
for
900
extra
resource
teacher
and
115
snas
from
January
2017
.
deputy
Burton
outline
the
€
35
million
for
high
education
.
Fianna
Fáil
say
it
want
€
100
million
.
I
be
not
sure
how
the
figure
go
to
€
35
million
but
I
be
sure
there
will
be
some
engagement
on
it
in
future
.
for
the
€
268
million
we
be
go
to
provide
through
we
costing
,
we
would
,
inter
alia
,
have
reduce
the
pupil
-
teacher
ratio
at
primary
school
level
by
one
point
at
a
cost
of
€
6
million
and
reduce
it
at
second
level
to
18:1
in
general
and
17.25:1
in
DEIS
school
at
a
cost
of
€
15.7
million
.
this
year
,
most
school
principal
contact
Member
of
the
House
because
they
be
find
themselves
increasingly
constrain
in
try
to
teach
while
also
handle
administration
and
increase
number
of
pastoral
issue
.
for
€
4.2
million
,
the
budget
could
have
provide
every
teaching
principal
with
one
administration
day
per
week
.
it
be
a
modest
amount
in
term
of
the
impact
it
could
have
have
.
the
national
training
fund
have
be
increase
by
€
21
million
to
address
demographic
growth
at
third
level
.
additional
funding
could
have
be
provide
for
the
technological
university
along
with
€
30
million
capital
for
minor
work
and
the
investment
in
equipment
.
something
beyond
the
mere
demographic
adjustment
be
require
.
we
all
recognise
that
every
budget
allow
for
demographic
change
but
it
be
necessary
to
be
a
little
bit
more
imaginative
than
that
.
that
be
why
there
be
a
sense
of
disappointment
on
this
side
of
the
House
in
regard
to
education
where
more
could
have
be
do
.
postgraduate
grant
could
have
be
reinstate
for
instance
.
it
would
have
cost
€
40
million
and
have
a
tremendous
effect
for
taxpayer
throughout
the
country
.
for
€
10
million
,
2000
additional
apprenticeship
could
have
be
create
.
the
school
building
programme
could
have
be
expand
by
€
50
million
.
we
talk
about
climate
change
and
the
greening
of
we
economy
.
for
€
24
million
,
solar
panel
could
have
be
provide
to
school
.
the
full
cost
of
that
measure
over
time
would
be
approximately
€
100
million
.
this
be
a
budget
which
have
fail
to
deliver
a
significant
impact
for
most
people
.
it
be
telegrap
to
we
early
this
morning
and
most
people
will
have
find
that
it
fail
to
deliver
much
by
way
of
a
societal
impact
.
it
be
not
deliver
a
whole
pile
in
term
of
they
income
.
they
will
not
feel
a
increase
in
they
income
as
a
result
of
the
budget
and
they
will
not
feel
a
increase
in
the
level
of
service
for
which
they
have
pay
heavily
through
taxation
.
that
be
why
we
be
say
it
lack
imagination
in
term
of
what
could
have
be
do
.
in
term
of
the
concept
of
decency
at
work
,
the
government
could
have
change
the
mandate
of
the
low
pay
Commission
.
we
propose
a
target
of
a
minimum
wage
of
60
%
of
the
median
earnings
by
2021
to
deliver
a
living
wage
for
all
.
instead
,
what
we
get
be
a
10
cent
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
,
which
will
be
erode
by
inflation
in
2017
.
more
imagination
in
this
area
could
have
result
in
a
amendment
to
the
term
of
reference
of
the
low
pay
Commission
,
which
would
have
have
a
impact
.
we
want
to
do
more
in
regard
to
transport
.
the
government
have
announce
€
15
million
in
current
expenditure
and
€
55
million
in
capital
expenditure
to
increase
the
subvention
,
which
be
welcome
on
one
level
.
however
,
at
a
cost
of
€
1.2
million
,
the
government
could
have
deliver
a
2
%
increase
in
the
subvention
to
Dublin
Bus
,
to
Bus
Éireann
at
a
cost
of
€
1.8
million
and
to
Iarnród
Éireann
at
a
cost
of
€
2.2
million
.
in
term
of
the
immediate
approval
of
all
national
road
project
where
planning
have
commence
,
we
propose
a
spend
of
€
61
million
and
for
the
road
network
from
Cork
to
Limerick
and
Galway
,
a
additional
€
10
million
this
year
to
bring
the
project
to
a
planning
stage
.
if
the
government
be
serious
about
regional
development
-
the
action
plan
for
Jobs
state
it
want
to
create
350000
job
outside
of
Dublin
-
then
proper
infrastructure
be
require
.
we
need
to
develop
the
Atlantic
corridor
,
which
include
the
line
between
Sligo
,
Galway
,
Limerick
,
Cork
,
Tralee
and
Kerry
.
it
be
very
important
for
regional
development
and
nationally
as
well
.
in
my
remain
time
,
I
wish
to
discuss
the
help
-
to
-
buy
scheme
.
I
take
some
sounding
from
first
-
time
buyer
who
can
not
get
on
to
the
first
rung
of
the
housing
ladder
.
the
couple
to
whom
I
speak
be
young
.
they
come
into
we
constituency
office
and
tell
we
they
can
not
get
on
the
first
rung
of
the
ladder
.
they
early
analysis
of
the
help
-
to
-
buy
scheme
be
that
if
a
sunset
clause
of
December
2019
be
apply
to
the
scheme
,
in
real
term
it
would
mean
that
more
people
would
seek
to
take
advantage
of
the
scheme
which
would
result
in
a
system
whereby
first
-
time
buyer
would
be
compete
against
each
other
.
it
be
a
Darwinian
theory
.
the
scheme
be
unworkable
and
unfair
on
that
couple
.
they
be
already
stress
to
the
hilt
by
virtue
of
the
fact
they
can
not
get
on
the
first
rung
of
the
ladder
.
I
do
not
know
what
€
600,000
would
buy
in
term
of
a
starter
home
.
I
do
not
know
what
the
logic
of
that
figure
be
.
maybe
in
south
Dublin
or
in
the
bastion
of
Fine
Gael
,
there
be
such
price
range
.
the
people
we
represent
will
not
be
buy
starter
home
for
€
600,000
.
the
scheme
need
to
be
work
through
.
I
be
always
inherently
suspicious
when
I
hear
the
Construction
Industry
Federation
welcoming
a
scheme
.
one
could
argue
that
it
will
have
a
inflationary
effect
on
the
cost
of
housing
,
which
be
something
we
have
to
prevent
.
we
need
a
bit
of
equity
.
information
we
have
state
that
no
rebate
will
be
pay
on
house
purchase
in
excess
of
€
600,000
.
I
do
not
know
the
logic
of
the
minister
's
position
on
that
.
the
threshold
for
rental
income
in
the
rent
-
a
-
room
scheme
have
increase
by
€
2000
to
bring
it
from
€

what
will
the
effect
of
that
be
?
it
will
increase

for
people
who
be

in

right
across
the
country

where
be
the
logic
in
that
?
this
be
a
do
nothing
budget

have
be
design
by

a

nothing
Dáil
.
it
will
not
provide
any
real
material
benefit
for
the
vast
majority
of
people
.
it
will
actually
work
against
a
large
swathe
of
people
,
in
particular
young
people
who
want
to
get
on
to
the
first
rung
of
the
housing
ladder
.
they
will
look
at
the
budget
and
say
there
be
nothing
here
for
they
.
I
move
:
that
it
be
expedient
to
amend
the
law
relate
to
inland
revenue
(
include
value
-
add
tax
and
excise
)
and
to

I
be
pleased
that
the

I
be
acutely
aware
of
the
economic
impact
of

over
235000

Ireland

micro

and
this
make
up
almost
99
%
of
all
active

and
nearly
50
%
of
private
sector
employment
.
that
job
be
spread
across
all
county

we
need
to
continue
to
reward

encourage
that

start
a
business
and
that
who
continue
to
take

I
welcome

make
to
the

lower
the

from
20
%

I
also
welcome

will
review
the

as
Minister

I
will

as
deputy
know
,
regional
job
creation
have
be
a
priority
for
the
government
.
we
want
to
ensure
that
all
region
,
city
and
town
be
facilitate
in
achieve
they
economic
potential
.
that
be
what
the
eight
regional

all
about
.
they
be
about
get
thing
work
from
the
bottom
up
and
bring
private

public

interest
together
to
implement

and
deliver

the
aim
of
this
plan
be
to
create
almost
250000
job
across

.
with

will
support

this
be
all
part
of
the
programme
for

so
far
be
very
encouraging
.
since
the
first
quarter
of
2015
,
the
national
employment
rate
have
fall
from
10
%
to
8.6
%
and
all
eight
region
have
record
a
reduction
in
the
rate
of
unemployment
over
that
period
.
the
government
continue
to
support
the
regional
job
agenda
,
with
the
large
enterprise
allocation
in
over
a
decade
.
IDA
Ireland
will
see
its
capital
funding
grow
by
22
%
to
€
137

.
some
of
the
additional
money
will
enable
it
to
progress
three
more

in

,
with
new
build
plan
for

be
announce
in

a

million
be
announce
for
a

in
2017
,
Enterprise
Ireland
will
continue
to
roll
out
additional
competitive
regional
fund
to
support
collaborative
approach
to
job
creation
across
the
region
.
to
ensure
a
very
strong
focus
on
regional

,
the
capital
allocation
to

office
be
also
increase
by
€
4
million
,
from

18.5
million

.
this
recognise
they
potential
to
generate

up
and
job
creation

the

demonstrate
the

Brexit
will
present
a
significant
challenge
for
we
,
as
many
speaker
have
say
.
the
fall
in
sterling
have
harden
my
resolve
to
work
to
deal
with
the
challenge
which
Brexit
pose
to
company
in
Ireland
.
volatility
in
exchange
rate
always
present
challenge
and
I
be
particularly
conscious
of
the
scale
and
impact
on
the
indigenous
sector
.
over
the
medium
to
long
term
,
exchange
rate
volatility
highlight
the
importance
of
focus
on
a
wide
spectrum
of
competitive
policy
,
in
particular
policy
to
enhance
competition
and
productivity
.
a
competitive
and
sustainable
base
can
help
to
provide
a
buffer
zone
against
exchange
rate
fluctuation
and
other
uncontrollable
external
factor
.
with
we
plan
to
grow
the
number
of
job
support
by
the
enterprise
agency
,
additional
resource
have
be
provide
in
the
budget
for
2017
,
primarily
for
staff
resource
for
Enterprise
Ireland
in
the
context
of
Brexit
.
Enterprise
Ireland
be
be
provide
with
a
total
exchequer
capital
allocation
of
€
185
million
.
some
€
63
million
of
this
,
a
increase
of
12
%
,
be
focus
on
general
enterprise
development
and
business
support
and
€
122
million
,
a
increase
of
3.7
%
,
be
for
its
research
and
development
support
activity
.
I
welcome
the
extra
resource
Enterprise
Ireland
will
benefit
from
,
in
order
to
support
its
client
in
the
face
of
Brexit
.
we
can
just
tell
everybody
now
.
I
congratulate
Fianna
Fáil
and
Fine
Gael
.
they
long
running
show
be
more
like
a
documentary
.
on
the
one
hand
,
Fianna
Fáil
be
knock
Fine
Gael
for
the
budget
,
yet
its
deputy
will
probably
sit
on
they
hand
and
support
it
very
shortly
.
this
be
not
a
good
budget
for
Ireland
.
it
be
certainly
not
a
good
budget
for
anybody
under
26
.
it
be
certainly
not
a
good
budget
for
pensioner
.
if
one
be
part
of
the
squeeze
middle
,
it
certainly
be
not
a
very
good
budget
.
it
be
mention
a
while
ago
that
it
be
not
appropriate
to
give
the
undereducated
-
26
's
the
extra
freaky
fiver
,
as
we
will
call
it
.
if
one
put
oneself
into
the
position
of
a
22
or
23
year
old
who
have
a
part
-
time
job
,
be
probably
live
at
home
,
have
borrow
money
from
the
credit
union
and
be
pay
back
a
loan
,
a
fiver
make
a
awful
lot
of
a
difference
.
it
have
not
be
put
into
perspective
.
I
have
a
phone
call
the
other
night
at
9.20
p.m.
from
a
83
year
old
gentleman
who
be
so
disgusted
with
the
fiver
that
I
actually
think
it
be
my
fault
.
he
say
,
"
I
do
not
want
it
,
Pat
,
give
it
to
the
kid
.
"
there
be
a
sense
of
anger
.
I
do
not
think
deputy
in
the
Chamber
realise
what
damage
have
be
do
to
ordinary
work
people
and
to
real
working
family
.
there
have
to
be
a
reality
check
here
.
again
today
in
the
Chamber
I
listen
to
the
leader
of
Fianna
Fáil
criticise
the
Fine
Gael
leader
on
investment
in
health
and
mental
health
.
yet
,
a
number
of
week
ago
when
we
propose
to
do
something
about
it
,
Fianna
Fáil
Deputy
sit
on
they
hand
.
there
be
no
political
will
in
this
Chamber
.
I
also
hear
the
Fianna
Fáil
leader
,
deputy
Micheál
Martin
,
state
a
number
of
day
ago
when
we
be
discuss
the
budget
that
Fianna
Fáil
do
not
write
the
budget
.
I
can
certainly
say
that
Fianna
Fáil
coloured
it
in
because
it
have
the
hallmark
of
both
party
.
we
know
what
will
happen
in
a
couple
of
day
's
time
.
it
beggar
belief
that
there
could
not
have
be
a
good
way
on
this
budget
.
it
should
have
be
about
invest
in
we
country
by
invest
in
public
service
,
housing
,
road
,
broadband
and
school
.
establish
the
knock
-
on
effect
of
this
be
not
rocket
science
.
the
government
have
to
invest
in
real
job
,
give
people
a
opportunity
to
earn
real
money
and
improve
the
service
we
have
.
they
be
all
pay
tax
.
it
be
not
rocket
science
.
the
knock
-
on
effect
of
that
would
be
that
the
government
would
address
the
problem
in
housing
and
we
education
system
.
it
would
certainly
take
the
stress
off
the
health
service
by
invest
in
people
.
it
go
back
to
one
thing
.
each
and
every
one
of
this
people
would
actually
have
proper
,
pay
job
so
they
could
pay
tax
.
it
be
about
make
a
fair
and
more
affordable
system
for
we
citizen
.
the
government
have
a
opportunity
to
do
it
but
unfortunately
we
stick
to
the
status
quo
here
which
be
very
unfortunate
.
Big
bang
budget
be
also
mention
.
perhaps
it
be
not
a
big
bang
budget
for
Fine
Gael
or
Fianna
Fáil
but
it
be
certainly
a
big
bang
budget
for
under
-
26
,
pensioner
and
what
the
government
class
as
the
squeeze
middle
.
that
be
the
reality
of
this
budget
.
we
have
to
empathise
with
people
outside
this
Chamber
.
even
as
a
newly
elect
deputy
,
I
understand
the
notion
of
be
in
a
bubble
,
but
we
actually
leave
the
bubble
now
and
again
and
engage
with
real
people
.
we
be
here
as
elect
representative
to
work
on
behalf
of
the
people
we
represent
.
I
have
a
son
at
home
who
will
be
a
teenager
very
shortly
.
he
be
excited
about
try
to
go
out
and
get
a
job
and
save
up
for
he
first
car
.
this
budget
do
not
give
much
hope
to
the
young
people
of
today
.
it
have
deflate
the
people
we
should
probably
respect
the
most
in
this
country
,
that
be
we
ageing
population
,
which
be
on
the
rise
.
they
be
the
people
who
build
this
country
.
we
should
be
plan
ahead
for
this
but
we
be
not
.
we
be
go
back
to
the
same
old
status
quo
,
specifically
target
certain
area
.
deputy
Doherty
mention
the
figure
of
€
20
million
a
while
back
.
that
could
have
be
use
in
a
more
productive
way
.
we
can
discuss
figure
and
number
,
but
we
have
listen
to
the
debate
over
the
last
few
day
and
it
just
seem
to
be
repetitive
.
I
speak
to
a
gentleman
last
Friday
at
my
clinic
in
Midleton
.
he
ask
I
what
it
be
like
up
here
.
I
say
,
"
it
be
100
mph
,
it
be
difficult
but
it
can
be
rewarding
.
"
he
ask
I
to
do
he
a
favour
.
he
say
,
"
when
you
go
into
the
Chamber
,
will
you
speak
plain
English
?
do
not
be
intoxicated
by
the
exuberance
of
somebody
's
vocabulary
.
"
I
laugh
.
the
reason
I
laugh
be
the
people
do
not
need
fancy
term
.
they
do
not
need
all
of
this
colouring
in
and
shading
of
number
.
they
want
the
brass
-
tack
truth
,
and
the
brass
-
tack
truth
of
this
budget
be
that
it
be
not
good
for
the
young
people
of
this
country
and
be
certainly
not
good
for
this
country
's
sick
people
,
pensioner
or
the
squeeze
middle
.
when
there
be
another
election
,
I
hope
people
will
remember
what
have
happen
in
this
Chamber
.
we
can
debate
this
budget
at
length
,
but
at
time
one
feel
one
be
waste
time
because
the
outcome
will
not
be
good
for
the
people
who
put
they
faith
in
we
.
I
could
talk
for
long
,
but
it
be
very
difficult
.
we
in
this
chamber
will
be
judge
on
merit
.
when
the
next
election
be
hold
I
hope
and
pray
that
,
please
God
,
the
young
people
,
pensioner
and
the
squeeze
middle
of
this
country
will
remember
this
.
I
welcome
the
minister
's
comprehensive
reply
detail
both
the
humanitarian
response
from
Ireland
's
perspective
and
the
multilateral
political
engagement
at

the

reference
the

so
far
.
we
have
a
debate
on
this
issue
last
week
and
there
be
suppose
to
be
a
ceasefire
last
weekend
.
the
United
Nation
have
be
hope
to
use
it
to
evacuate
seriously

people
and
deliver
aid
,
but
that
do
not
appear
to
have
happen
.
have
the
minister
give
consideration
to
the
fact
that
no
aid
have
be
deliver
in
Aleppo
since
7
July
?
the
UN
Secretary
General
say
food
would
run
out
,
possibly
by
the
end
of
this
month
.
what
be
the
minister
's
view
on
this
stark
fact
?
what
Srebrenica
be
to
the
1990
,
Aleppo
be
to
the
2010s
and
the
western
world
,
in

need
to
up

good
office
and
whatever
influence
he
have
through

Service
to
encourage
the
Arab

in
its
response

,
the
deputy
have
also
argue
that
we
need
to
begin
negotiation
formally
for
a
successor
deal
to
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
.
that
would
accelerate
pay
restoration
for
all
public
servant
.
finally
,
yesterday
we
at
least
receive
confirmation
that
this
will
happen
during
2017
.
we
have
also
argue
,
and
the
Seanad
have
agree
to
this
,
that
a
employer
labour
conference
should
be
establish
.
it
be
we
view
that
the
government
have
wait
too
long
to
take
any
meaningful
action
.
we
keep
hear
the
mantra
that
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
be
the
only
show
in
town
.
as
I
have
make
clear
,
we
hope
that
a
resolution
will
be
find
with
gardaí
today
,
but
even
if
that
be
the
case
,
at
this
stage
it
be
abundantly
clear
that
the
government
's
mantra
be
not
good
enough
.
we
need
mechanism
that
will
avoid
such
dispute
from
become
increasingly
common
.
we
need
to
keep
teacher
in
classroom
,
nurse
in
hospital
and
gardaí
on
the
beat
.
the
more
than
300000
public
servant
who
work
in
various
sector
need
to
be
at
work
and
not
on
strike
.
during
the
bad
period
of
we
history
we
manage
to
preserve
industrial
peace
.
it
be
beyond
belief
how
the
government
have
allow
this
situation
to
regress
so
rapidly
.
this
week
the
impact
of
industrial
unrest
seem
likely
to
become
very
real
.
my
question
to
the
Taoiseach
be
as
follow
.
of
the
range
of
idea
propose
by
the
Labour
Party
to
prevent
grow
industrial
unrest
,
will
he
seriously
consider
any
of
they
?
will
he
explain
how
the
outworking
of
the
public
service
pay
commission
will
feed
into
the
potential
successor
to
the
Lansdowne
Road
agreement
,
if
at
all
?
will
he
provide
more
detailed
information
on
the
contingency
arrangement
that
be
be
put
in
place
in
the
event
of
a
strike
on
Friday
?
