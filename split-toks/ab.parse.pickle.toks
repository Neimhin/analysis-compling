I
have
a
question
for
Mr.
Gunning
.
he
mention
the
issue
of
compliance
by
the
contractor
with
the
programme
.
presumably
this
be
a
programme
of
work
,
a
agree
workflow
chart
,
to
use
vernacular
,
non-technical
language
.
where
stand
the
work
programme
at
present
?
I
ask
Mr.
Gunning
to
please
answer
in
layman
's
term
,
not
in
technical
speak
.
what
be
the
work
programme
's
status
?
that
be
okay
.
I
thank
Mr.
Gunning
.
I
thank
Mr.
Gunning
.
I
thank
Mr.
Gunning
.
turn
to
Mr.
Dempsey
,
the
next
question
be
for
the
Department
of
Health
.
be
there
a
representative
of
the
Department
on
the
board
?
that
be
the
first
simple
question
.
there
be
not
.
however
,
presumably
the
Department
of
Health
,
ergo
the
minister
,
ergo
the
taxpayer
,
have
some
mechanism
by
which
it
can
express
a
opinion
on
the
level
of
claim
.
I
refer
both
to
the
cost
of
that
claim
and
the
number
of
that
claim
.
in
other
word
,
have
there
ever
be
a
expression
of
worry
by
anybody
in
the
Department
of
Health
,
at
a
sufficiently
high
level
-
right
up
to
the
minister
-
in
respect
of
the
level
of
claim
?
a
expression
of
worry
or
-----
-----
or
fear
as
to
the
cost
of
claim
and
the
escalate
cost
of
claim
.
I
be
try
to
understand
why
we
be
at
the
position
we
be
at
now
.
without
put
word
in
the
witness
's
mouth
,
it
be
reasonable
for
I
to
assume
from
he
response
that
there
would
have
be
a
expression
of
worry
for
the
process
around
claim
.
this
lead
I
on
to
the
next
question
.
in
he
open
statement
,
Mr.
Dempsey
state
"
the
development
board
and
the
Department
be
near
finalisation
of
this
long
and
detailed
analysis
,
which
include
a
determination
of
potential
update
to
the
timeline
and
cost
of
the
project
.
"
to
what
extent
be
the
claim
process
map
onto
that
"
long
and
detailed
analysis
"
?
if
I
understand
the
previous
witness
correctly
,
it
seem
to
I
that
if
one
be
try
to
map
who
be
win
the
battle
of
the
claim
war
,
the
board
be
about
a
nose
ahead
at
present
but
in
the
long
-
term
analysis
,
it
could
be
that
the
contractor
might
come
out
on
top
from
a
financial
point
of
view
.
in
other
word
,
be
there
a
deep
analysis
of
this
take
place
around
the
claim
process
?
as
soon
as
the
finding
of
that
report
be
available
,
I
ask
that
they
be
forward
to

I
join
in
welcoming
the
witness
this
morning
.
I
have
a
short
time
so
if
I
can
have
a
rapid
fire
round
of
question
,
I
would
be
grateful
for
that
opportunity
.
where
stand
the
conversation
with
the
government
about
the
resumption
of
point
-
to
-
point
racing
?
Mr.
Kavanagh
have
previously
make
the
point
about
run
meeting
on
racecourse
.
I
speak
specifically
for
Cork
.
I
do
not
think
it
would
be
practical
to
run
Kildorrery
,
Killeagh
or
Dromahane
point
-
to
-
point
meeting
in
Mallow
racecourse
at
this
point
in
time
.
Mr.
Kavanagh
might
have
a
view
on
that
.
we
would
like
to
see
a
resumption
of
point
-
to
-
point
race
in
they
natural
state
in
the
location
that
the
many
people
who
go
to
point
-
to
-
point
race
would
normally
visit
.
in
the
absence
of
people
be
able
to
go
to
point
-
to
-
point
race
,
can
this
race
be
run
in
original
location
like
Kildorrery
or
Dromahane
?
how
soon
will
that
happen
?
on
remuneration
,
be
I
give
to
understand
that
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
have
be
notify
of
the
remuneration
of
all
person
employ
by
HRI
or
its
subsidiary
?
in
essence
,
while
Mr.
Kavanagh
be
say
a
derogation
have
be
seek
‚Äî
I
refer
specifically
to
there
be
a
conflict
between
the
derogation
and
gdpr
requirement
in
respect
of
readily
identifiable
person
,
to
use
Mr.
Kavanagh
's
phrase
‚Äî
be
the
information
on
the
remuneration
of
the
relevant
person
or
all
person
still
hold
with
the
Department
of
Agriculture
,
food
and
the
Marine
?
I
want
to
be
very
clear
about
this
.
if
we
can
not
get
the
information
from
HRI
directly
,
can
this
committee
,
in
this
era
of
transparency
,
seek
it
directly
from
the
Department
?
where
a
individual
be
serve
on
a
State
body
,
be
a
member
of
a
board
or
hold
a
executive
position
,
and
where
significant
amount
of
taxpayer
's
money
be
be
give
to
the
board
or
organisation
in
question
,
the
least
we
should
expect
be
the
notification
of
the
remuneration
package
.
I
do
not
believe
it
be
fair
to
say
the
information
be
commercially
sensitive
because
HRI
be
,
de
facto
,
operate
a
monopoly
in
respect
of
the
horse
racing
industry
in
Ireland
.
do
Mr.
Kavanagh
agree
?
I
thank
Mr.
Kavanagh
.
my
last
point
be
on
third
party
event
hold
at
HRI
venue
,
such
as
Mallow
racecourse
.
I
still
call
it
Mallow
racecourse
because
I
be
a
proud
Mallowman
.
HRI
call
it
Cork
Racecourse
Mallow
.
there
be
a
fair
at
the
racecourse
,
a
home
and
garden
fair
.
be
it
anticipate
that
third
-
party
event
such
as
that
will
continue
or
will
be
pencil
into
the
calendar
?
I
would
imagine
such
event
provide
vital
revenue
stream
for
HRI
and
the
individual
racecourse
,
but
they
be
also
vital
to
the
non-horse
fraternity
or
confraternity
.
I
want
to
make
sure
there
be
proactive
engagement
to
ensure
as
many
people
as
possible
can
enjoy
the
venue
and
the
event
hold
in
they
.
I
be
put
my
hand
up
for
the
garden
fair
that
take
place
in
Mallow
every
year
.
can
we
expect
the
resumption
of
event
like
that
in
the
not
-
too
-
distant
future
,
subject
to
public
health
guideline
?

I

Gabhaim

I
apologise
if
my
question
be
repetitive
.
I
wish
to
ask
about
the
existence
of
the
EU
procurement
directive
.
I
profess
to
be
somewhat
ignorant
on
this
issue
but
I
will
seek
the
witness
's
guidance
.
I
understand
that
article
20
of
the
directive
allow
for
reserve
contract
for
certain
type
of
entity
.
I
be
speak
specifically
about
social
enterprise
or
that
people
who
operate
within
the
disability
sector
.
my
understanding
be
that
this
provision
of
the
directive
be
not
be
operate
in
Ireland
.
I
be
seek
some
sort
of
appraisal
or
response
from
the
witness
from
the
OGP
with
regard
to
whether
it
be
be
operate
.
if
it
be
not
possible
to
answer
my
question
within
the
timeframe
allocate
to
I
today
,
could
there
be
a
report
of
some
write
correspondence
to
the
committee
about
whether
or
not
disability
-
focus
organisation
be
be
exclude
from
apply
for
reserve
contract
?
be
I
to
understand
that
the
OGP
be
not
oblige
to
police
,
a
word
which
I
use
lightly
,
whether
or
not
local
authority
or
public
body
be
actually
exercising
the
reserve
contract
or
the
article
20
provision
?
be
that
the
case
?
Mr.
Quinn
say
that
the
OGP
have
transpose
the
directive
faithfully
,
verbatim
,
if
I
understand
he
correctly
.
it
be
not
a
lead
question
but
it
would
be
worry
if
we
be
not
use
reserve
contract
to
encourage
certain
category
of
worker
who
be
able
to
access
they
.
one
would
hope
that
the
OGP
would
be
as
proactive
as
possible
,
especially
in
the
disability
sector
and
social
enterprise
.

this
front

I
thank

I
thank
Mr.
Black
and
he
colleague
for
attend
before
the
committee
today

I
want
to
start
with
the
situation
of
Ulster
Bank
,
which
be
a
key
lender
in
the
SME
food
sector
.
in
my
analysis
,
it
have
be
see
as
the
key
bank
to
go
to
for
small
to
medium
-
size
food
company
seek
to
access
lending
for
productive
purpose
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
from
Mr.
Black
as
to
,
first
,
whether
there
be
now
a
high
level
of
exposure
for
that
sector
,
give
the
decision
of
Ulster
Bank
to
pull
out
of
the
market
,
and
,
second
,
whether
SBCI
be
aware
of
this
and
if
it
be
something
that
be
on
its
agenda
.
if
we
take
the
two
challenge
of
Covid
and
Brexit
,
as
well
as
the
importance
of
the
food
sector
and
the
recognition
of
Ulster
Bank
as
be
a
go
-
to
bank
for
small
to
medium
-
size
food
company
that
be
export
drive
,
be
there
a
consciousness
within
SBCI
of
the
need
to
plug
that
gap
in
lending
?
be
this
a
conversation
that
be
take
place
at
present
?
I
would
like
to
get
that
perspective
from
Mr.
Black
,
if
I
may
.
be
my
perception
right
and
be
my
research
solid
in
say
that
there
be
a
strong
relationship
between
food
company
and
Ulster
Bank
in
particular
?
I
accept
that
there
be
strong
relationship
with
other
bank
.
Ulster
Bank
be
,
however
,
the
go
-
to
bank
for
certain
entity
in
the
food
sector
.
I
refer
,
for
example
,
to
small
,
mainly
family
-
run
start
-
up
or
,
perhaps
,
high
potential
start
-
up
company
that
be
scaling
up
and
export
.
I
be
seek
comfort
from
the
SBCI
on
what
Mr.
Black
say
about
the
mou
.
be
that
Mr.
Black
's
view
,
insofar
as
he
can
speak
for
Ulster
Bank
and
insofar
as
we
be
still
go
through
a
process
here
?
I
do
not
want
to
see
a
chunk
of
lending
potential
slip
off
the
radar
and
a
chunk
of
a
sector
that
be
vital
to
Ireland
's
economic
interest
find
itself
in
a
position
where
it
have
no
go
-
to
bank
for
the
type
of
funding
the
SBCI
provide
to
the
on-lender
.
can
Mr.
Black
give
I
some
level
of
comfort
in
that
regard
?
a
signal
from
the
SBCI
in
respect
of
that
matter
would
give
some
assurance
to
people
who
live
,
breathe
and
work
in
this
sector
every
day
.
I
understand
that
the
agriculture
fund
set
up
by
the
SBCI
be
oversubscribe
.
be
it
the
view
of
the
SBCI
that
there
be
potential
for
a
new
funding
facility
in
that
sector
?
again
,
this
be
a
vital
sector
.
it
be
export
-
drive
and
face
the
headwind
of
Covid
-
19
.
obviously
,
Brexit
still
hang
above
many
company
and
producer
like
the
sword
of
Damocles
.
be
it
the
intention
of
the
SBCI
to
look
at
potential
funding
in
the
agriculture
sector
?
it
be
lend
for
productive
purpose
.
the
fund
in
question
be
oversubscribe
in
the
previous
round
.
Mr.
Black
might
also
give
we
he
perspective
on
that
.
can
Mr.
Black
talk
I
through
the
strategic
review
for
the
period
2020
to
2025
?
he
refer
to
new
sme
funding
for
the
energy
retrofit
sector
.
how
advanced
be
that
conversation
at
present
?
when
do
Mr.
Black
see
the
SBCI
move
into
that
sector
for
productive
lending
?
how
do
he
propose
that
that
money
will
be
disburse
?
reference
be
make
to
the
credit
union
.
to
what
extent
do
Mr.
Black
see
credit
union
as
a
viable
option
for
funding
into
this
sector
?
it
very
much
filter
down
to
the
local
economy
.
where
stand
the
conversation
in
that
regard
?
Mr.
Black
mention
the
Department
.
obviously
,
the
SBCI
be
in
discussion
with
the
parent
Department
.
detail
be
important
for
people
like
we
in
the
committee
.
be
that
money
propose
to
be
divest
through
the
SBCI
's
on
-
lending
partner
?
what
be
the
entity
through
which
Mr.
Black
be
talk
about
divest
money
?
I
will
move
very
briefly
on
to
the
issue
of
pay
.
be
pay
rate
for
employee
set
by
the
NTMA
?
they
be
performance
-
related
pay
rate
.
why
be
performance
-
related
payment
make
in
2019
,
for
instance
,
when
SBCI
have
a
loss
that
year
of
‚Ç¨
408000
?
if
I
may
please
Mr.
Black
,
as
I
have
limited
time
,
I
be
not
be
facetious
in
any
way
but
I
want
to
understand
the
dynamic
or
the
metric
Mr.
Black
use
when
determine
pay
rate
.
respectfully
,
I
fail
to
see
the
link
between
quantitative
ease
and
the
setting
of
pay
scale
.
there
be
some
mention
in
the
review
relate
to
the
abatement
and
pull
back
of
SBCI
.
I
would
read
that
language
as
withdraw
.
be
the
bank
's
existence
justify
at
the
present
time
?
I
appreciate
the
chair
for
let
I
back
in
.
I
have
a
example
of
a
sme
that
be
operate
in
the
tourism
,
leisure
and
outdoor
sector
.
the
owner
make
approach
to
Close
Brother
and
KBCI
in
respect
of
SBCI
funding
.
when
he
contact
KBCI
,
he
be
inform
that
it
be
use
the
SBCI
future
growth
loan
scheme
fund
,
but
it
be
,
and
I
quote
from
the
email
,
"
only
offer
loan
to
business
register
with
a
professional
body
"
.
I
ask
the
SBCI
to
carry
out
a
examination
of
that
interaction
internally
.
I
can
give
the
witness
the
name
of
the
company
follow
the
meeting
.
none
of
we
want
to
see
unnecessary
impediment
be
put
in
the
way
of
sme
if
they
happen
to
be
seek
funding
in
a
sector
of
the
economy
that
might
not
pass
muster
with
"
banking
type
"
.
I
might
be
a
little
unkind
in
my
use
of
language
.
the
application
be
somewhat
leave
field
,
but
nonetheless
,
it
be
worth
further
examination
.
the
owner
seem
to
have
to
jump
through
hoop
with
the
SBCI
in
order
to
pass
muster
.
the
main
point
that
I
be
make
be
that
certain
sector
of
the
economy
should
not
be
discount
on
the
basis
that
they
be
not
deem
to
be
fashionable
or
de
rigueur
.
I

Black

I
join
in
welcoming
Ms
Forbes
and
she
team
before
we
today
.
I
acknowledge
the
work
RT√â
have
do
throughout
the
pandemic
as
part
of
its
public
broadcasting
remit
,
particularly
in
reassure
people
and
relieve
they
anxiety
over
the
past
12
month
or
so
and
impart
information
base
on
science
and
fact
.
I
only
have
a
few
minute
.
there
be
so
many
thing
I
would
like
to
talk
about
but
I
will
focus
on
the
independent
sector
.
as
I
understand
it
,
the
independent
production
sector
be
protect
under
the
Broadcasting
Act
2009
.
I
want
to
delve
a
little
deep
into
how
Ms
Forbes
propose
to
increase
that
funding
as
we
open
up
society
and
the
economy
.
what
reassurance
can
she
give
to
that
sector
that
it
will
be
the
beneficiary
of
increase
funding
for
output
for
the
next
12
to
24
month
?
I
thank
Ms
Forbes
.
she
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
there
be
a
obligation
on
RT√â
as
per
the
legislation
and
she
have
confirm
that
it
will
fulfil
that
commitment
.
that
be
where
I
be
go
with
my
point
so
I
welcome
that
reply
.
I
wholeheartedly
agree
about
how
people
procure
they
content
now
and
the
multiplicity
of
device
that
be
available
to
people
.
we
have
not
be
strong
enough
politically
in
acknowledge
that
content
be
not
free
.
there
be
a
price
to
be
pay
and
a
cost
incur
in
create
content
.
we
will
all
watch
with
interest
what
happen
in
Australia
and
Ms
Forbes
make
a
point
about
how
that
might
permeate
through
to
Ireland
.
I
be
interested
in
whether
RT√â
be
now
think
about
5g
and
thing
like
the
roll
-
out
of
enhance
fibre
broadband
.
Donnybrook
and
the
citadel
that
be
RT√â
be
a
place
where
there
be
a
lot
of
production
go
on
but
surely
to
goodness
with
the
advent
of
5G
,
and
people
be
already
talk
about
6g
,
there
be
a
mechanism
to
use
more
geographical
location
to
produce
content
and
give
voice
to
the
region
in
how
we
produce
content
in
this
country
,
because
the
technology
would
allow
we
to
do
that
.
okay
.
I
thank
Ms
Forbes
.
I
apologise
for
the
early
technical
issue
.
as
a
result
of
hold
meeting
remotely
due
to
Covid
,
there
can
sometimes
be
a
bit
of
overlap
between
witness
and
committee
member
and
they
can
end
up
talk
over
one
another
.
we
have
try
to
manage
as
good
we
can
.
I
thank
the
witness

they
patience
and
assistance
with
all
of
that
.
I

the
committee
of
Public
account
be
adjourn
until
2.30
p.m.
tomorrow
,
28
April
,
when
the
committee
will
meet
in
private
session
.
I
support
deputy
Catherine
Murphy
on
this
.
it
be
a
area
we
need
to
devote
more
time
to
.
there
be
myriad
question
arise
from
that
response
.
the
mapping
of
contract
across
the
high
education
institution
,
HEI
,
landscape
be
unclear
and
opaque
.
further
light
need
to
be
shine
on
it
because
it
have
permutation
for
the
public
purse
.
I
would
support
100
%
any
attempt
by
this
committee
to
devote
some
considerable
time
as
necessary
to
this
issue
.
the
minister
state
at
a
Irish
Federation
of
University
teacher
,
IFUT
,
conference
that
he
wish
to
do
something
about
precarious
contract
.
I
recognise
that
be
a
matter
of
policy
;
however
,
it
seem
that
even
at
ministerial
level
there
be
a
recognition
of
the
nature
of
this
contract
and
we
should
continue
the
work
of
the
last
committee
of
Public
account
on
this
issue
.
I
would
like
to
explore
further
the
relationship
from
a
spending
point
of
view
between
Enterprise
Ireland
and
some
of
the
institute
of
technology
,
iot
,
for
instance
,
in
relation
to
thing
like
innovation
voucher
and
partnership
.
there
be
a
whole
space
that
warrant
further
examination
in
respect
of
how
funding
be
use
to
support
the
scaling
-
up
and
spin
-
out
of
company
,
and
how
the
spin
-
out
infrastructure
be
support
within
this
organisation
.
where
be
the
money
really
go
?
be
it
result
in
the
level
of
output
it
be
suppose
to
result
in
,
in
relation
to
job
creation
or
the
creation
of
company
that
be
productive
,
as
oppose
to
company
sustain
within
a
system
,
in
some
case
for
inordinate
amount
of
time
?
it
beg
the
question
about
productivity
.
I
would
support
that
call
.
the
time
limit
of
two
hour
be
very
restrictive
and
I
have
try
to
stretch
that
five
minute
out
,
particularly
where
a
member
be
in
the
middle
of
try
to
get
a
answer
or
a
accounting
officer
be
in
the
process
of
answer
a
question
.
I
have
try
to
stretch
it
to
six
or
seven
minute
and
to
get
a
second
round
of
question
in
.
we
have
manage
that
,
I
think
,
at
every
meeting
since
last
September
.
please
God
everything
will
go
well
with
vaccination
and
with
Covid
-
19
and
we
will
move
into
a
situation
where
we
can
have
long
meeting
and
get
all
member
into
one
room
,
where
I
will
be
able
to
see
the
white
of
member
's
eye
.
there
be
good
chemistry
where
people
be
in
one
room
.
Online
be
a
improvisation
but
it
be
not
as
satisfactory
.
for
now
,
however
,
we
be
bind
by
the
health
regulation
.
we
can
reschedule
another
meeting
.
we
will
be
bring
they
back
in
on
emergency
accommodation
.
for
the
other
matter
,
we
should
seek
to
do
that
as
well
.
there
be
a
big
spend
on
housing
,
which
be
welcome
.
some
of
we
would
argue
for
more
but
that
be
a
separate
issue
.
it
be
important
we
deal
with
that
department
as
fully
as
possible
.
we
will
try
to
do
that
.
last
week
,
we
agree
we
draft
report
on
we
engagement
with
the
Office
of
Public
Works
,
OPW
.
we
ask
the
clerk
how
we
might
launch
the
report
.
a
launch
on
the
Plinth
be
not
see
as
practical
for
committee
report
launch
as
there
be
difficulty
with
physical
distancing
,
limitation
on
number
attend
and
the
weather
,
although
it
be
suppose
to
pick
up
.
the
AV
room
also
have
restriction
on
the
number
that
can
attend
.
it
be
possible
to
launch
the
report
on
team
.
while
we
would
need
a
committee
room
for
it
to
be
a
public
broadcast
,
we
could
also
hold
a
launch
on
team
that
be
not
publicly
broadcast
.
the
advantage
of
that
be
we
would
not
need
a
committee
room
to
do
it
,
there
be
no
restriction
on
the
number
of
member
or
journalist
attend
,
member
can
join
remotely
from
a
place
of
they
choose
as
it
be
not
a
formal
meeting
of
the
committee
and
the
launch
can
be
record
and
publish
on
the
committee
's
web
page
.
I
propose
that
,
subject
to
the
necessary
arrangement
be
make
on
time
,
we
launch
the
report
at
12
noon
on
Thursday
after
we
public
meeting
with
the
Department
of
Transport
.
as
usual
,
a
press
release
will
be
send
out
by
email
and
share
on
social
media
.
be
member
happy
to
agree
to
that
approach
?
agree
.
if
no
member
wish
to
raise
any
other
matter
,
we
will
adjourn
until
Thursday
,
27
May
at
9.30
a.m.
,
when
we
will
engage
with
the
Department
of
Transport
.
I
thank
the
chairman
for
facilitate
I
as
I
have
some
technical
issue
.
I
welcome
the
official
.
I
will
focus
on
programme
b
,
land
transport
,
which
be
80
%
of
the
overall
gross
expenditure
for
2019
.
I
also
acknowledge
that
the
2021
total
be
‚Ç¨
3.3
billion
.
arise
from
land
transport
,
there
be
the
Road
Safety
Authority
,
RSA
.
the
Secretary
General
will
be
aware
that
there
be
a
serious
backlog
in
driver
theory
testing
and
driver
testing
.
approximately
100000
people
be
wait
for
driver
theory
testing
and
the
number
be
similar
for
the
other
test
.
today
's
issue
be
the
relationship
between
the
Department
of
Transport
and
the
RSA
in
work
through
the
backlog
of
list
.
I
wish
to
explore
further
that
relationship
in
how
resource
be
deploy
by
the
Department
to
the
RSA
.
the
reason
I
be
ask
specifically
about
the
rsa
be
that
notwithstand
the
positive
engagement
that
I
have
have
with
the
agency
on
driver
theory
testing
and
driver
test
backlog
,
the
announcement
in
the
past
number
of
day
of
a
interim
solution
to
be
provide
by
move
driver
theory
testing
online
do
not
get
off
to
a
great
start
because
the
number
of
people
who
will
be
test
under
that
online
system
will
be
4000
.
there
be
also
further
inherent
issue
then
as
to
how
the
technology
be
deploy
.
why
,
for
instance
,
be
only
4000
people
be
test
online
with
this
new
interim
solution
?
how
be
the
department
resource
that
?
what
be
the
nature
of
the
relationship
of
the
rsa
with
the
Department
to
ensure
that
we
move
from
4000
be
test
up
to
the
full
cohort
and
backlog
be
test
,
which
be
the
full
100000
plus
of
people
who
be
wait
for
test
?
what
be
the
technological
issue
arise
from
this
interim
solution
where
we
be
be
tell
that
to
apply
for
the
online
driving
test
someone
have
to
have
a
window
8
personal
computer
,
PC
,
or
above
and
that
that
use
a
phone
,
tablet
or
Mac
computer
will
be

,
as
will
that
use

or
iOS
?
applicant
must
also
be
able
to
use
Google
Chrome
and
the
minimum
speed
have
to
be
5
mbp
.
I
want
to
explore
with
the
Department
its
relationship
with
the
rsa
on
the
basis
that
it
be
a
key
department
in
get
Ireland
move
again
in
a
post
Covid
-
19
society
.
if
we
be
to
get
people
off
the
pandemic
unemployment
payment
,
pup
,
and
other
Department
of
social
Protection
payment
to
enable
they
to
move
,
we
need
driver
theory
and
driver
testing
to
be
fit
for
purpose
.
what
be
Mr.
Spratt
's
current
appraisal
on
when
the
Department
expect
that
full
cohort
of
people
to
be
test
and
what
resource
be
be
deploy
by
he
Department
to
ensure
that
the
rsa
be
fully
resource
so
that
people
can
get
back
on
the
road
?
I
welcome
that
assurance
.
the
100000
people
wait
for
the
driver
theory
test
and
the
100000
who
be
wait
for
the
full
test
may
take
some
comfort
from
that
word
.
for
the
cohort
who
be
wait
on
the
driver
theory
test
,
the
technology
need
to
be
user
-
friendly
and
fit
for
purpose
and
there
should
be
protocol
put
in
place
in
term
of
the
use
of
the
technology
,
in
that
when
camera
technology
be
be
use
,
assurance
be
give
to
the
person
who
be
be
test
that
any
datum
collect
be
collect
in
a
safe
and
appropriate
way
.
that
be
important
for
people
who
have
decide
to
put
trust
in
the
system
.
if
the
RSA
can
reach
a
target
of
50000
per
month
,
the
list
will
be
get
through
within
a
short
space
of
time

,
the
committee
will
meet
in
private
session
.
on
the
inspection
regime
in
respect
of
HAP
and
RAS
,
I
have
a
parliamentary
question
from
deputy
√ì
R√≠ord√°in
.
I
will
speak
specifically
about
the
local
authority
of
Cork
County
Council
and
Cork
City
Council
.
it
show
that
the
number
of
inspection
carry
out
to
September
2020
in
County
Cork
be
611
and
in
the
city
of
Cork
be
434
.
notwithstanding
the
public
health
restriction
,
we
can
take
out
all
of
the
last
12
month
in
term
of
the
inspection
regime
.
be
the
Secretary
General
satisfied
that
the
inspection
regime
be
properly
fund
-
we
all
speak
from
we
own
experience
as
public
representative
-
such
that
it
can
be
ensure
that
the
policy
and
legislation
be
work
effectively
and
we
do
not
have
family
live
in
absolute
slum
?
that
be
how
I
would
describe
some
of
the
property
I
have
see
that
be
beneficiary
of
ras
or
hap
payment
.
I
contend
that
the
inspection
regime
be
not
fit
for
purpose
.
I
do
not
want
to
put
the
blame
on
the
local
authority
.
what
be
the
link
between
the
Department
and
the
local
authority
in
respect
of
ensure
the
inspectorate
pass
muster
and
be
fit
for
purpose
?
I
put
the
question
to
the
Secretary
General
.
I
be
conscious
of
my
time
.
the
point
I
make
here
be
that
the
witness
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
issue
with
inspection
.
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
have
have
a
bear
in
term
of
the
number
of
inspection
.
I
ask
that
this
be
prioritise
,
so
that
the
Department
would
liaise
with
the
local
authority
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
inspection
regime
be
fit
for
purpose
,
robust
,
and
properly
resource
,
and
so
that
there
be
a
significant
increase
in
the

have

possible

be
about
taxpayer

the
end
of

if

talk
about
taxpayer
's

,
we
cannot
have
a
situation
where
we
have
quite
literally

this
be
the
outworking

first
of
all
,
I
will
start
by
wish
Niall
well
.
forgive
I
,
if
I
refer
to
you
in
a
informal
manner
.
I
be
a
former
minister
of
State
in
that
Department
and
I
have
work
with
you
in
the
past
.
we
have
all
be
tremendously
impressed
by
the
leadership
that
you
have
give
in
such
challenging
time
.
I
note
that
you
say
you
be
retire
,
but
you
be
step
down
as
Secretary
General
.
we
hope
that
you
will
stay
within
the
service
in
some
way
,
shape
or
fashion
.
personally
,
I
wish
you
well
.
it
be
important
that
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
,
both
for
the
work
that
it
do
at
the
bilateral
level
in
term
of
its
bilateral
relation
with
country
throughout
the
globe
and
also
at
the
multilateral
level
where
it
deal
with
the
Unite
Nation
and
other
such
organisation
.
we
be
lucky
to
have
a
Department
of
foreign
affair
that
be
staff
by
what
I
would
I
call
the
A
team
in
term
of
the
work
that
it
do
as
a
department
throughout
the
globe
.
I
note
,
in
particular
,
the
reference
to
consular
service
.
for
we
,
as
tds
,
and
for
Senator
,
we
primary
interface
with
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
be
normally
through
either
consular
service
or
the
Passport
Office
.
I
want
to
acknowledge
that
that
often
hidden
and
silent
work
be
very
significant
and
that
it
have
help
so
many
of
we
constituent
throughout
the
country
,
particularly
where
bereavement
have
occur
.
I
fully
acknowledge
that
role
because
it
be
vitally
important
,
and
also
that
it
would
be
resource
appropriately
.
let
I
start
with
that
.
on
passport
,
where
stand
the
foreign
birth
registration
process
?
that
might
be
one
that
the
Secretary
General
might
want
to
defer
to
he
colleague
.
I
be
happy
to
receive
a
note
after
this
meeting
,
if
that
be
possible
,
in
term
of
a
real
-
time
analysis
of
where
the
foreign
birth
registration
be
at
present
.
I
will
move
on
.
it
be
significant
that
today
we
have
a
British
-
Irish
intergovernmental
meeting
here
in
Dublin
.
the
organisation
of
that
will
consume
a
lot
of
the
resource
of
the
Department
.
where
be
the
priority
in
respect
of
the
reconciliation
fund
in
the
light
of
the
challenge
of
Brexit
and
Covid
and
be
there
a
clear
earmarking
of
fund
now
to
meet
that
challenge
?
I
would
like
a
understanding
of
where
the
thinking
be
on
how
that
resource
be
deploy
and
if
there
be
a
pivot
towards
the
challenge
of
Brexit
,
or
not
.
I
thank
Mr.
Burgess
.
I
will
move
now
the
Irish
Aid
programme
.
a
number
of
conflict
have
arise
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
,
particularly
in
Ethiopia
where
there
be
a
Irish
embassy
and
aid
programme
.
I
refer
to
the
Gambella
and
Tigray
region
.
I
be
concerned
about
Irish
citizen
who
be
work
in
that
region
.
I
be
concerned
on
the
one
hand
that
there
may
not
be
a
sufficient
deployment
of
resource
to
ensure
the
safety
and
security
of
Irish
citizen
and
,
on
the
other
,
that
the
programme
,
in
particular
what
be
know
as
the
safety
net
programme
to
ensure
food
security
,
be
be
hamper
by
the
conflict
.
can
Mr.
Burgess
reassure
we
that
there
be
sufficient
protection
of
Irish
citizen
,
in
particular
embassy
staff
,
Irish
,
non-Irish
and
local
,
and
of
that
work
in
ngo
in
the
conflict
area
in
order
that
they
can
carry
out
they
work
?
what
be
they
status
?
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
if
increase
resource
have
be
deploy
into
that
effort
in
real
time
.
that
be
reassuring
.
that
be
the
first
time
that
we
have
hear
that
.
we
have
read
about
the
conflict
in
Tigray
but
it
be
reassuring
that
there
be
clear
protocol
for
the
safety
of
both
embassy
staff
and
that
work
on
the
ground
.
I
cannot
let
the
opportunity
pass
to
ask
about
B√≥thar
and
whether
there
be
any
financial
exposure
of
Irish
Aid
or
the
Department
to
the
recent
B√≥thar
scandal
.
can
the
Secretary
General
tell
we
anything
about
any
exposure
that
the
taxpayer
have
have
?
I
be
conscious
of
what
the
chair
be
say
.
I
will
put
the
question
another
way
.
have
Irish
Aid
ever
fund
B√≥thar
?
that
be
a
factual
yes
-
no
answer
.
I
want
to
get
a
perspective
without
prejudice
any
ongoing
case
.
I
wish
to
ask
about
the
occupy
territory
and
the
disbursement
of
funding
,
the
late
round
of
which
be
about
‚Ç¨
12.7
million
but
I
be
open
to
correction
on
that
.
be
the
department
satisfied
that
this
disbursement
be
go
exactly
where
it
need
to
go
?
I
know
there
be
a
particular
emphasis
on
funding
education
within
the
occupy
territory
.
can
Mr.
de
B√∫rca
or
the
Secretary
General
provide
a
perspective
on
the
importance
of
funding
by
the
Department
of
foreign
affair
and
the
Irish
taxpayer
into
the
occupy
territory
?
I
wish
to
thank
the
people
in
Ramallah
as
well
for
the
work
they
do
on
behalf
of
the
Irish
citizen
.

,
it
be
the
board
make
the
variation
that
give
rise
to
the
claim
.
I
would
like
a
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
answer
.
I
be
try
to
understand
this
correctly
.
I
thank
Mr.
Devine
.
so
who
be
the
employer
's
representative
in
this
process
?
the
architect
.
help
I
out
here
.
the
architect
be
the
designer
of
the
project
from
day
one
but
the
architect
be
also
the
arbiter
in
respect
of
the
decision
on
claim
.
be
this
correct
?
in
broad
term
I
be
correct
in
what
I
be
say
.
Mr.
Devine
be
say
a
independent
person
be
build
in
but
it
be
still
the
architect
and
it
be
still
come
from
the
project
board
side
.
that
be
the
point
.
that
be
fine
.
there
be
906
claim
notify
under
clause
10.3
for
determination
by
the
employer
's
representative
.
Mr.
Devine
have
send
we
the
document
on
the
10.3
clause
and
there
be
six
subheadings
.
person
will
be
able
to
interpret
they
quite
easily
.
if
I
understand
it
correctly
what
the
witness
have
state
today
be
the
value
of
that
906
claim
be
now
approximately
‚Ç¨
446
million
.
be
that
correct
?
there
be
nine
dispute
agree
and
no
long
in
dispute
management
to
the
value
of
‚Ç¨
2.9
million
.
that
be
correct
.
we
do
not
have
the
main
contractor
or
any
of
the
subcontractor
before
we
.
we
do
not
have
the
mechanical
,
electrical
or
lift
contractor
before
we
.
we
have
to
take
everything
Mr.
Devine
be
say
at
face
value
.
I
be
try
to
dig
a
little
bit
deep
on
this
.
it
seem
to
I
the
claim
arise
from
variation
make
.
notwithstanding
the
line
,
which
be
well
co-ordinate
,
that
have
be
put
forward
to
we
today
by
the
Department
of
Health
and
Mr.
Gunning
that
external
cost
will
drive
this
project
well
beyond
whatever
figure
be
to
be
determine
and
well
beyond
the
initial
cost
and
the
state
public
cost
,
there
be
also
the
issue
that
the
development
board
,
and
I
be
try
to
be
as
objective
as
possible
,
be
part
of
the
process
of
drive
up
cost
because
of
the
variation
it
be
make
.
be
this
a
reasonable
statement
to
make
?
effectively
,
the
main
contractor
be
the
postbox
use
for
any
subcontracting
increase
or
variation
.
the
witness
explain
what
a
variation
or
claim
be
.
where
there
be
such
variation
to
the
order
outline
,
any
mechanical
,
electrical
or
lift
variation
have
to
come
from
the
subcontractor
to
the
main
contractor
through
that
postbox
to
the
board
.
be
this
correct
?
do
I
have
that
right
or
be
I
wrong
?
okay
.
okay
.
be
it
reasonable
in
a
normal
contractual
process
to
claim
for
time
?
be
this
Mr.
Devine
's
experience
as
a
project
director
?
the
project
be
run
into
billion
of
euro
at
this
stage
.
be
this
normal
practice
?
Mr.
Gunning
have
speak
about
a
inordinate
number
of
claim
.
he
refer
to
the
heat
of
the
battle
.
I
thank
the
chair
.
I
will
go
back
to
the
906
claim
notify
for
er
determination
under
the
10.3
clause
.
have
we
determine
that
the
estimate
cost
of
outstanding
claim
be
‚Ç¨
446
million
?
I
be
sorry
.
that
be
what
the
contractor
be
claim
.
can
Mr.
Devine
clarify
what
have
be
settle
from
that
‚Ç¨
446
million
?
this
lead
I
to
my
next
question
about
the
legal
process
.
this
be
a
matter
of
public
record
so
it
should
not
be
sensitive
information
.
can
the
witness
quantify
the
number
of
proceedings
that
have
end
up
in
the
high
Court
?
on
how
many
occasion
have
the
development
board
end
up
in
the
high
Court
?
who
have
instigate
that
proceedings
and
what
have
be
the
cost
to
the
taxpayer
,
ultimately
,
of
that
?
that
be
public
knowledge
-----
it
be
public
knowledge
so
please
give
a
straight
answer
.
it
be
not
commercially
sensitive
.
what
be
the
cost
so
far
?
I
have
a
practical
,
procedural
question
for
we
visit
tomorrow
.
will
the
contractor
be
there
to
meet
we
?

I
,
too
,
join
in
thank
Mr.
Reid
and
he
colleague
throughout
the
HSE
for
the
work
that
have
be
undertake
during
this
pandemic
,
for
which
there
have
be
no
playbook
and
no
precedent
.
it
be
something
that
have
to
be
manage
in
a
emergency
context
and
the
level
of
care
people
receive
have
,
by
and
large
,
be
excellent
.
I
acknowledge
that
Mr.
Reid
have
always
make
himself
available
to
member
of
the
Oireachtas
on
issue
that
have
arise
throughout
the
pandemic
.
when
certain
matter
arise
within
my
constituency
,
they
be
respond
to
so
I
have
to
acknowledge
that
.
I
will
focus
on
non-compliance
in
procurement
.
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
's
report
state
that
the
HSE
be
develop
system
and
be
make
significant
improvement
in
that
regard
.
that
be
to
be
acknowledge
.
I
will
focus
on
the
more
than
‚Ç¨
40
million
that
have
be
spend
by
the
HSE
to
date
across
a
range
of
service
provide
by
Ernst
&
Young
,
PwC
,
grant
Thornton
,
Deloitte
and
KPMG
,
both
pandemic
related
and
non-pandemic
related
.
do
‚Ç¨
40
million
represent
value
for
money
for
the
taxpayer
?
we
know
that
Ernst
&
Young
have
provide
service
to
the
tune
of
‚Ç¨
12
million
and
that
PwC
have
provide
service
for
‚Ç¨
5.1
million
.
a
total
of
‚Ç¨
17.5
million
have
be
spend
across
the
five
company
up
to
March
2021
.
we
know
it
be
govern
by
a
framework
agreement
.
what
we
do
not
know
,
and
this
be
what
I
be
try
to
get
at
,
be
how
that
individual
contract
be
manage
within
the
work
stream
.
we
know
that
individual
company
provide
different
type
of
service
,
as
per
the
procurement
rule
.
however
,
in
term
of
the
scope
of
work
,
what
be
perplex
I
be
how
grant
Thornton
can
receive
‚Ç¨
4.2
million
for
the
year
up
to
March
2021
,
Deloitte
can
receive
‚Ç¨
4.2
million
and
KPMG
can
receive
‚Ç¨
3.1
million
.
this
be
astronomical
figure
.
what
I
do
not
have
sight
of
and
the
taxpayer
-----
how
many
minute
do
I
have
leave
?
what
the
taxpayer
do
not
have
sight
of
be
the
line
-
by
-
line
accounting
procedure
in
respect
of
how
that
hour
be
bill
for
.
please
do
not
throw
commercial
sensitivity
at
I
on
this
one
because
all
of
the
consultancy
house
have
benefit
remarkably
from
the
provision
of
this
service
under
presumably
clear
procurement
rule
.
what
we
do
not
have
sight
of
be
how
many
people
be
second
or
deploy
and
how
that
be
be
manage
internally
by
the
HSE
in
term
of
due
diligence
and
manage
the
contract
and
cost
.
there
be
no
document
anywhere
I
have
sight
of
that
show
I
,
or
by
extension
,
the
taxpayer
,
the
dynamic
that
inform
that
individual
contract
in
the
public
interest
and
in
term
of
protect
the
"
public
purse
"
,
to
quote
Mr.
Mulvany
.
this
be
a
issue
to
which
we
need
to
return
.
we
need
more
transparency
.
I

when

to

and
any

business
.
I
want
to
ask
Mr.
Reid
if
he
be
aware
there
be
a
proposal
by
the
HSE
to
close
the
Owenacurra
centre
in
Midleton
,
County
Cork
,
where
19
resident
will
be
rehouse
across
a
number
of
other
setting
throughout
the
county
and
possibly
beyond
.
I
have
two
point
.
first
,
we
still
do
not
have
sight
of
what
the
cost
of
refurbishment
would
be
.
second
,
it
be
we
understanding
that
it
be
propose
to
rehouse
or
rehome
some
people
in
institutional
setting
like
St.
Stephen
's
Hospital
in
Glanmire
and
also
in
St.
Catherine'
,
and
possibly
on
the
site
of
St.
Finbarr
's
Hospital
in
Cork
.
if
it
be
the
case
that
the
HSE
be
propose
to
re-institutionalise
people
at
a
time
when
the
HSE
policy
and
government
policy
be
to
decongregate
,
I
think
that
would
be
take
very
seriously
.
I
ask
that
the
HSE
take
another
look
at
this
decision
on
the
basis
that
people
be
very
concerned
,
give
where
it
be
propose
that
people
will
be
send
to
,
in
that
this
further
institutionalise
they
.
all
I
be
ask
at
this
stage
be
that
Mr.
Reid
take
another
look
at
this
and
run
the
rule
over
it
,
as
chief
executive
officer
.
I
will
leave
it
there
.
SouthDoc
be
very
important
.
during
the
pandemic
,
a
number
of
cell
be
take
out
of
action
,
and
that
be
the
fact
of
the
matter
.
Mitchelstown
and
Fermoy
,
as
well
as
the
Cork
centre
,
be
take
out
.
this
mean
that
car
be
go
much
further
afield
to
cover
off
service
on
a
out
-
of
-
hour
basis
.
it
mean
that
doctor
be
much
more
stretch
,
if
they
be
do
home
visit
.
please
do
not
tell
we
how
the
service
work
.
we
know
how
the
service
work
.
there
be
a
fear
that
the
‚Ç¨
7.5
million
of
taxpayer
's
investment
in
this
service
be
not
buy
enough
scrutiny
of
the
service
that
be
be
provide
,
notwithstand
the
fact
it
be
a
separate
entity
.
there
be
a
presence
by
the
HSE
on
the
board
of
SouthDoc
.
to
my
mind
,
that
busy
the
taxpayer
and
the
HSE
great
scrutiny
of
how
SouthDoc
operate
.
on
deputy
Colm
Burke
's
point
,
which
he
run
out
of
time
on
,
I
share
he
view
.
more
and
more
people
be
now
go
to
Cork
University
Hospital
,
CUH
,
on
a
accident
-
and
-
emergency
basis
and
bypass
SouthDoc
because
they
do
not
feel
confident
that
they
will
be
see
at
time
by
SouthDoc
.
we
need
to
deal
with
perception
in
the
public
mind
as
to
how
SouthDoc
operate
.
I
be
very
familiar
with
the
Mallow
service
and
the
Mitchelstown
-
Fermoy
service
.
they
be
excellent
service
staff
by
brilliant
people
.
I
could
not
say
enough
good
thing
about
they
.
however
,
we
do
not
have
a
service
in
Youghal
out
of
hour
.
someone
who
phone
from
Youghal
be
expect
to
go
to
Midleton
.
that
be
a
journey
of
about
half
a
hour
.
the
service
at
time
be
stretch
between
the
Waterford
border
and
the
Kerry
border
.
there
need
to
be
a
review
of
how
SouthDoc
operate
.
it
be
we
view
that
the
‚Ç¨
7.5
million
investment
of
taxpayer
's
money
busy
the
HSE
great
scrutiny
to
ensure
that
it
be
triage
and
build
out
a
public
message
in
a
way
that
ensure
that
if
people
can
avoid
the
accident
and
emergency
department
in
CUH
and
go
through
they
local
service
,
while
that
service
be
very
good
,
there
might
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
scrutiny
or
some
sort
of
review
as
to
how
the
service
operate
,
particularly
within
the
city
.
there
need
to
be
a
look
back
on
why
the
Blackpool
and
Fermoy
-
Mitchelstown
service
be
close
because
the
HSE
take
out
a
massive
geographical
area
there
.
they
be
take
out
during
the
pandemic
.
I
ask
-
this
be
my
only
ask
-
that
the
HSE
look
back
on
how
SouthDoc
operate
during
the
pandemic
.
a
little
report
could
be
furnish
to
member
of
the
Oireachtas
or
there
could
be
just
a
look
back
on
the
basis
of
what
lesson
can
be
learn
,
how
the
service
,
which
be
by
and
large
a
excellent
service
,
can
operate
more
efficiently
and
whether
it
can
cover
more
sufficiently
east
Cork
.
I
be
convinced
that
it
be
not
cover
the
Youghal
area
.
it
do
not
have
sufficient
resource
to
cover
the
Youghal
area
and
ensure
that
people
in
Youghal
or
further
afield
be
not
force
to
go
to
Midleton
or
onward
to
Cork
,
directly
to
a
accident
and
emergency
department
.
I

I
remind
member
that
it
be
okay
to
come
back
into
the
committee
room
.
I
know
some
have
be
complain
for
the
last

about
not
be

to
come
into

that
be
difficult
for
witness
and
member
.
I
apologise
for
that
.
I
try
to
manage
it
as
good
I
can
.
I
will
start
with
the
Dublin
Docklands
SDZ
.
my
understanding
of
this
be
that
in
2014
NAMA
adopt
a
secondary
objective
of
the
facilitation
of
the
development
of
office
accommodation
in
Dublin
and
have
a
interest
in
17
ha
of
the
22
ha
of
the
undeveloped
land
in
the
Dublin
Docklands
SDZ
.
my
understanding
be
that
Mr.
McDonagh
's
board
approve
a
business
plan
for
that
site
in
September
2014
and
that
there
be
no
formal
target
set
out
in
that
business
plan
.
I
also
understand
that
by
the
end
of
2018
construction
be
under
way
or
have
be
complete
on
70
%
of
the
land
in
which
NAMA
have
a
interest
and
that
by
May
2020
construction
be
under
way
or
have
be
complete
on
site
accounting
for
86
%
of
the
land
in
which
NAMA
have
a
interest
.
regard
the
commercial
development
of
the
Dublin
Docklands
SDZ
,
can
Mr.
McDonagh
confirm
for
I
what
percentage
of
the
NAMA
land
have
see
full
construction
to
date
?
may
I
hear
Mr.
McDonagh
's
understanding
of
the
impact
of
Covid
on
commercial
development
?
we
now
know
that
more
people
will
be
work
from
home
and
that
few
people
will
be
require
to
inhabit
,
if
you
will
,
commercial
development
.
can
Mr.
McDonagh
give
I
a
insight
into
NAMA
's
thinking
in
respect
of
the
future
of
commercial
development
,
such
as
the
Dublin
Docklands
SDZ
in
particular
,
in
the
context
of
the
impact
of
Covid
on
commercial
space
into
the
future
?
what
I
be
get
at
be
whether
there
will
be
a
need
to
pivot
back
to
residential
.
that
be
ultimately
what
I
be
try
to
figure
out
.
we
understand
NAMA
's
remit
and
the
legislation
,
but
there
be
the
potential
for
3500
residential
unit
at
the
Poolbeg
West
site
.
that
be
clearly
understand
.
we
know
that
there
be
about
93000
sq.
m
of
commercial
development
.
will
Mr.
McDonagh
talk
I
through
where
Poolbeg
be
at
present
?
my
question
be
specific
.
have
a
prefer
bidder
be
identify
for
NAMA
's
venture
partner
in
the
old
glass
bottle
site
at
Poolbeg
West
?
at
what
stage
of
development
be
the
Poolbeg
West
SDZ
?
what
impact
have
Covid
have
on
the
development
of
Poolbeg
?
what
impact
,
if
any
,
have
increase
construction
cost
have
on
the
budget
for
the
development
of
Poolbeg
West
?
on
the
35000
residential
unit
,
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
breakdown
or
understanding
of
how
that
will
be
divide
between
social
,
affordable
and
commercial
development
.
if
social
house
be
to
be
develop
on
the
site
,
what
will
the
ownership
structure
of
the
land
be
?
will
it
be
lease
?
will
it
be
use
by
approve
housing
agency
?
I
ask
Mr.
McDonagh
to
give
a
more
in
-
depth
analysis
of
the
Poolbeg
site
.
I
will
conclude
.

be
very
grateful
.
I
want
to
understand
well
the
relationship
between
a
Taisce
and
various
Department
and
statutory
funding
body
.
we
all
understand
,
possibly
on
a
superficial
level
,
the
work
a
Taisce
do
in
respect
of
education
.
it
be
inherently
good
work
,
particularly
when
it
come
to
blue
flag
and
green
school
initiative
.
it
would
be
very
useful
for
we
to
understand
the
financial
relationship
.
we
can
bear
in
mind
that
between
2018
and
2019
,
there
be
a
restatement
of
figure
.
I
wish
to
understand
that
good
and
how
the
Department
have
deal
with
that
matter
.
I
also
would
like
to
get
a
overview
of
the
relationship
that
exist
,
include
whether
there
be
service
level
agreement
in
place
.
if
there
be
,
how
do
they
operate
?
do
the
line
Department
that
be
funder
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
restrict
fund
,
have
a
expectation
about
the
governance
of
any
organisation
that
they
may
fund
,
even
if
it
be
a
charitable
organisation
?
I
be
seek
the
support
of
the
committee
for
we
to
write
to
the
line
Department
with
a
view
to
get
further
information
in
order
to
well
inform
ourselves
.
I

I
welcome
Mr.
Gloster
and
he
team
to
the
committee
.
a
article
appear
on
Monday
,
27
September
,
in
the
Irish
Examiner
where
Mr.
Gloster
speak
at
length
in
respect
of
private
provision
of
residential
care
.
the
article
state
:
Mr
Gloster
say
that
many
private
care
placement
be
work
well
but
add
:
''
the
big
risk
of
that
level
of
dependency
on
private
care
be
private
operator
can
leave
the
market
;
they
can
leave
quickly
,
they
can
sell
on
;
company
structure
can
become
very
complex
,
and
the
reality
be
that
if
you
have
a
private
provider
in
a
house
with
four
young
people
,
if
that
private
provider
leave
the
market
,
the
State
have
only
one
option
and
that
be
for
we
to
take
over
that
provision
there
''
.
be
there
a
shift
in
policy
in
Tusla
such
that
it
be
go
to
wind
down
private
care
provider
?
be
that
a
signalling
of
a
policy
shift
?
what
be
the
real
-
time
position
in
respect
of
that
?
the
witness
might
bear
in
mind
that
I
have
ten
minute
and
there
be
four
question
I
would
like
to
ask
.
I
have
a
couple
of
question
follow
on
from
that
.
as
I
understand
it
,
there
be
a
entity
call
Positive
Care
,
which
be
on
Tusla
's
list
of
private
provider
.
a
cursory
look
at
the
information
for
this
organisation
show
that
it
run
13
or
14
house
.
base
on
the
ratio
of
staff
to
child
,
I
conclude
that
there
could
be
anything
between
30
and
60
child
be
care
for
across
that
service
.
what
do
the
future
look
like
for
a
entity
like
Positive
Care
and
why
do
such
a
organisation
exist
in
the
first
instance
?
it
seem
obvious
that
Tusla
be
not
able
to
meet
the
provision
it
be
require
to
deliver
.
I
be
not
try
to
use
load
language
here
but
such
entity
would
not
exist
if
Tusla
,
objectively
speak
,
be
do
its
job
and
make
provision
for
that
place
within
its
own
system
.
I
acknowledge
that
and
I
appreciate
Mr.
Gloster
's
response
.
Tusla
provider
be
inspect
by
HIQA
but
Tusla
inspect
the
private
provider
on
its
list
.
at
what
stage
do
Mr.
Gloster
anticipate
there
will
be
a
change
in
that
regime
such
that
the
private
provider
be
inspect
by
HIQA
?
I
appreciate
the
frankness
of
that
response
.
it
be
about
as
frank
as
one
can
get
.
I
hope
the
regime
will
change
to
reflect
it
.
historically
,
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
have
report
significantly
on
the
cost
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
service
.
we
be
all
mindful
that
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
be
about
provide
care
for
child
and
ensure
,
in
a
court
hearing
or
any
judicial
process
,
that
the
voice
of
the
child
be
hear
.
I
be
concerned
about
the
cost
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
service
.
we
have
go
some
way
towards
legislate
for
change
in
that
area
during
the
lifetime
of
the
previous
d√°il
.
what
be
the
Child
and
Family
Agency
's
understanding
of
the
status
of
the
draft
head
of
a
Bill
to
make
change
to
the
guardian
ad
litem
service
and
what
engagement
have
it
have
with
the
Department
in
that
respect
?
Mr.
Gloster
say
in
he
open
statement
:
"
the
agency
receive
referral
to
its
child
protection
and
welfare
service
in
2020
at
just
below
70000
.
it
be
important
to
note
that
in
the
early
stage
of
the
Covid
-
19
response
,
we
see
a
concerning
decrease
.
"
have
all
of
that
70000
referral
be
expedite
?
be
Tusla
on
time
and
ahead
of
the
curve
in
term
of
all
referral
that
come
to
it
in

of
any
child

I
would
like
to
echo
deputy
McAuliffe
's
comment
in
seek
to
request
that
the
NTA
would
come
before
we
.
it
would
be
vital
,
if
at
all
possible
,
that
we
would
hear
from
it
on
this
issue
.
I
will
be
brief
.
as
be
usual
on
a
Thursday
there
be
sometimes
conflict
diary
requirement
.
I
want
to
seek
reassurance
in
respect
of
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
's
special
report
113
on
procurement
to
vehicle
by
the
Irish
Coast
Guard
,
that
there
be
a
clear
matching
up
between
the
four
recommendation
that
be
aim
at
strengthen
.
I
be
quote
from
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
's
report
that
they
be
aim
,
''
at
strengthen
the
Department
's
procurement
procedure
for
the
future
''
.
can
we
be
assure
of
the
follow
for
each
of
the
recommendation
for
the
strategic
plan
for
equipment
requirement
:
that
all
procurement
of
equipment
should
involve
technical
and
user
input
at
the
planning
stage
;
that
all
significant
procurement
should
be
base
on
formal
assessment
of
operational
need
;
and
that
the
Department
would
carry
out
regular
review
of
its
procurement
procedure
and
process
?
I
want
a
short
reassurance
from
the
Secretary
General
that
that
be
all
now
under
way
.
the
Secretary
General
state
that
the
Department
have
strengthen
its
analytical
tool
for
procurement
analysis
.
I
remain
to
be
assure
that
we
have
a
robust
and
fit
-
for
-
purpose
system
.
can
the
Secretary
General
give
we
that
assurance
?
that
be
my
first
question
.
I
will
ask
three
question
specifically
and
then
I
will
take
my
leave
.
the
second
question
be
about
national
secondary
route
.
major
construction
project
begin
in
2020
be
under
way
.
I
believe
strongly
that
there
be
a
need
for
a
policy
intervention
by
the
Department
in
respect
of
that
national
secondary
route
that
be
in
a
deplorable
state
,
such
as
the
N73
,
in
such
a
way
that
would
ensure
that
TII
,
fund
project
like
that
relate
to
the
Mallow
to
Mitchelstown
road
.
the
latter
be
,
arguably
,
one
of
the
bad
national
secondary
route
in
the
country
,
even
though
it
be
a
vital
artery
for
commercial
and
domestic
traffic
in
the
north
Cork
area
and
a
vital
route
between
Kerry
and
Dublin
.
I
continue
to
make
the
case
for
funding
for
this
road
.
I
ask
that
the
N73
project
remain
on
the
agenda
,
and
I
make
no
bone
about
raise
the
matter
at
this
forum
.
on
the
Leap
card
,
the
Secretary
General
inform
we
that
"
year
-
on
-
year
increase
in
fare
revenue
mean
that
PSO
funding
requirement
be
relatively
stable
.
"
I
be
seek
to
expand
Leap
card
service
in
my
county
of
Cork
,
specifically
on
route
between
Mallow
and
Cork
,
where
there
a
massive
number
of
commuter
on
a
daily
basis
and
where
there
be
still
not
a
Leap
card
service
,
even
though
it
could
be
argue
that
it
be
a
viable
route
.
I
can
travel
from
Bray
to
Pearse
Station
use
a
Leap
card
,
but
I
cannot
go
from
Mallow
to
Cork
.
there
be
a
inequality
between
service
on
the
eastern
seaboard
and
that
in
the
region
.
I
ask
that
,
as
a
policy
,
the
Department
look
at
the
roll
-
out
of
Leap
card
service
for
the
town
that
service
big
city
,
such
as
Cork
.
it
be
vitally
important
.
it
be
propose
to
note
and
publish
that
correspondence
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
that
conclude
we
consideration
of
correspondence
for
today
.
the
next
item
on
we
agenda
be
the
work
programme
.
last
week
,
we
agree

the

I

in
welcoming
the
Secretary
General
and
she
official
.
it
be
nice
to
see
some
familiar
face
from
my
old
Department
.
I
be
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
pose
some
question
.
I
will
stay
on
the
Covid
-
19
restart
grant
scheme
.
in
that
context
,
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
state
:
a
grant
scheme
that
rely
on
self
-
declaration
should
have
a
number
of
key
control
.
one
of
this
be

completion
of
post
payment
check
to
ensure
that
claimant
have
satisfied
the
condition
of
the
scheme
and
be
accordingly
entitle
to
the
payment
they
receive
.
the
Secretary

state
:
"
I
should
emphasise

.
we

.
it
would
be
useful
to
articulate
in
concise
term
how
the
Department
intend
to
answer
the
question
pose
by
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
.
it
be
widely
acknowledge
that
money
flow
into
business
quickly
and
it
be
a
responsive
scheme
in
that
regard
.
however
,
question

be

and
it
would

useful
to

would
look
like
.
we
understand
what
the

the

I

under

the

incorporate
into

include
the

.
all
be
laudable
project
and
be
to
be
support
.
however
,
they
will
all
bring
challenge
for
the
Department
.
the
big
shift
in
the
spending
capacity
of
the
Department
in
respect
of
this
cultural
institution
under
the
NDP
give
rise
to
a
number
of
specific
question
.
first
,
what
expertise
and
system
have
increase
at
Department
level
to
ensure
the
efficient
disbursement
of
funding
for
approve
capital
development
project
?
if
I
may
,
I
have
further
specific
question
that
may
assist
the
process
before
Ms
Licken
defer
to
she
colleague
.
they
be
very
specific
question
.
first
,
who
will
be
responsible
for
procurement
and
project
management
for
the
capital
development
project
in
the
cultural
institution
?
what
be
the
precise
role
of
the
Department
,
the
cultural
institution
and
,
where
applicable
,
the
opw
in
this
?
who
ultimately
manage
that
relationship
?
who
undertake
the
procurement
and
daily
project
oversight
?
who
sign
off
on
procurement
and
spending
,
the
Department
or
the
cultural
institution
?
if
overspend
occur
and
if
the
Legislature
,
through
this
committee
,
need
to
interrogate
certain
issue
,
who
will
appear
before
this
committee
?
look
at
the
project
I
refer
to
,
it
be
statistically
possible
there
might
be
issue
that
may
arise
in
respect
of
overspend
and
public
procurement
that
may
give
rise
to
question
that
have
to
be
answer
.
if
overspend
occur
,
who
would
appear
before
this
committee
?
would
it
be
the
Secretary
General
and
she
Department
or
the
cultural
institution
?
furthermore
,
what
additional
resource
and
expertise
have
be
make
available
to
the
cultural
institution
to
deal
with
this
increase
oversight
and
workload
?
that
be
just
one
parcel
of
question
.
there
be
further
question
on
this
issue
.
who
will
sign
off
on
the
procurement
?
I
want
to
understand
the
process
.
will
it
be
the
Department
or
the
cultural
institution
?
the
context
in
which
I
ask
this
question
be
that
I
worry
that
the
voluntary
board
of
the
institution
that
be
earmark
for
capital
development
project
,
notwithstand
they
expertise
on
cultural
and
governance
matter
,
might
not
have
expertise
on
procurement
matter
.
with
this
money
come
down
the
track
to
this
laudable
project
,
I
worry
that
there
might
not
be
the
capacity
within
the
institution
to
be
able
to
have
that
expertise
.
I
be
try
to
tease
out
whether
it
be
the
intention
of
the
Department
to
buttress
that
institution
with
additional
skill
set
as
befit
the
specific
project
as
it
arise
.
the
Secretary
General
say
a
dedicated
team
have
be
establish
comprise
economist
.
I
would
like
to
be
assure
whether
there
be
team
of
procurement
specialist
and
governance
specialist
be
ready
for
the
delivery
of
this
project
.
there
be
a
gap
there
and
it
be
give
rise
to
concern
.
I
do
not
feel
assure
by
the
answer
so
far
,
if
I
may
say
that
.
I
thank
Ms
Licken
.
I
appreciate
that
.
we
will
examine
the
matter
further
as
time
go
on
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
that
.
I
want
to
move
on
to
a
quite
bespoke
issue
,
namely
,
that
of
storage
within
the
cultural
institution
.
my
understanding
be
that
there
be
a
storage
facility
for
the
National
Museum
which
be
house
in
Swords
.
the
National
Museum
of
Ireland
's
collection
resource
centre
in
Swords
house
4
million
object
.
this
be
a
extraordinary
figure
.
what
do
the
future
hold
for
the
storage
of
the
key
object
in
we
national
collection
,
regardless
of
the
institution
?
I
understand
that
,
in
the
case
of
the
National
Museum
of
Ireland
,
there
be
only
eight
year
remain
on
the
exist
lease
and
that
a
rent
review
that
be
due
in
September
2020
have
still
not
be
conclude
.
if
we
be
seek
to
animate
any
of
the
project
I
outline
,
we
will
have
to
decont
many
of
the
artefact
or
piece
,
be
they
artistic
or
otherwise
,
to
other
site
.
how
be
the
witness
deal
with
the
issue
of
the
storage
of

I
happen
to
be
from
Cork
.
I
might
have
a
different
view
to
deputy
McAuliffe
on
the
amount
of
content
that
people
in
the
region
perceive
that
be
attribute
to
Dublin
.
I
will
begin
by
say
"
well
do
"
to
RT√â
on
its
late
partnership
with
Virgin
Media
Television
in
respect
of
the
six
Nation
Championship
.
that
be
a
wonderful
example
of
collaboration
.
speak
as
a
proud
Munster
man
and
a
Munster
rugby
supporter
,
I
also
commend
RT√â
,
TG4
and
the
independent
sector
on
the
provision
of
Unite
rugby
Championship
,
URC
,
output
.
I
strongly
believe
that
model
have
provide
excellent
content
for
the
average
punter
sit
at
home
who
want
to
view
rugby
or
sport
output
at
the
high
level
through
the
terrestrial
channel
.
the
URC
be
a
great
example
of
where
the
licence
payer
see
the
good
of
the
utilisation
of
that
fund
.
be
there
plan
to
expand
that
further
?
can
we
expect
to
see
more
of
that
?
do
the
director
general
perceive
that
RT√â
will
do
more
collaboration
of
that
nature
and
exploit
further
opportunity
so
that
more
and
more
people
can
enjoy
-
because
that
be
what
it
be
about
-
the
output
that
be
come
through
collaboration
of
that
nature
?
be
there
anything
in
the
pipeline
at
present
that
Ms
Forbes
can
tell
we
about
in
respect
of
that
collaborative
model
?
she
speak
about
the
diversification
of
sport
and
,
specifically
,
gender
,
which
be
absolutely
vital
,
but
what
be
in
pipeline
that
will
emb
that
model
further
?
from
the
ordinary
punter
's
point
of
view
,
and
I
be
a
ordinary
punter
in
this
regard
,
when
I
look
at
the
URC
coverage
I
see
the
good
of
RT√â
,
TG4
and
the
independent
sector
collaborate
.
look
at
the
Irish
examiner
model
of
deliver
sport
at
the
most
local
level
through
a
stream
package
,
I
can
tune
in
to
my
local
team
at
a
county
final
from
the
comfort
of
my
living
room
.
should
we
go
down
to
that
level
of
granularity
?
should
the
national
broadcaster
be
get
on
that
wagon
to
see
where
the
opportunity
lie
to
further
emb
itself
into
that
collaborative
model
so
that
there
be
more
output
and
RT√â
be
take
feed
from
a
more
diverse
range
of
venue
across
a
more
diverse
range
of
sport
?
the
technology
allow
we
to
do
that
now
.
presumably
,
RT√â
do
not
need
to
have
a
outside
broadcast
unit
at
every
single
venue
because
it
can
implant
technology
at
the
venue
and
take
the
feed
from
that
.
I
would
love
to
see
more
of
that
from
we
national
broadcaster
:
more
localised
,
more
regionalised
and
more
diverse
output
.
if
Ms
Forbes
can
tell
I
it
be
now
part
of
a
policy
in
RT√â
to
continue
with
that
,
it
will
give
many
people
a
lot
of
confidence
.
I
thank
Ms
Forbes
.
I
will
move
on
to
the
independent
sector
.
my
understanding
be
that
there
be
a
statutory
requirement
for
RT√â
to
spend
in
respect
of
it
.
for
instance
,
in
2020
,
the
statutory
requirement
be
to
spend
approximately
‚Ç¨
40.2
million
-
Ms
Forbes
might
correct
I
if
that
be
wrong
.
my
understanding
be
that
RT√â
spend
approximately
‚Ç¨
36.5
million
,
which
be
about
‚Ç¨
3.7
million
under
target
.
I
understand
that
the
Covid
pandemic
be
a
decide
factor
in
that
because
of
cancel
production
and
so
on
,
but
the
underspend
be
then
require
to
be
spend
within
two
year
.
will
Ms
Forbes
elaborate
,
or
educate
we
,
on
how
RT√â
plan
to
spend
that
underspend
?
again
,
I
speak
specifically
for
the
independent
sector
,
which
be
starve
of
funding
at
present
,
have
plan
afoot
to
deliver
content
and
be
anxious
to
get
go
again
.
what
word
of
assurance
can
Ms
Forbes
give
we
that
that
will
be
spend
?
what
plan
be
afoot
in
that
regard
?
I
ask
the
witness
to
please
forgive
I
if
they
have
answer
a
question
on
this
matter
before
but
I
have
to
attend
another
meeting
.
I
seek
assurance
on
the
future
of
the
Cork
radio
and
television
study
.
can
Ms
Forbes
give
we
a
guarantee
that
there
be
a
sustainable
future
for
Cork
specifically
?
I
thank
Ms
Forbes
.
if
I
may

or
have
the
chairman
move
on
?
can
I
speak
to
no.
978B
?
I
be
a
little
bit
concerned
.
I
welcome
and
acknowledge
the
fact
that
the
Department
have
correspond
with
we
in
respect
of
a
Taisce
.
however
,
I
be
a
little
confused
about
question
Nosemcue
3
and
4
,
specifically
the
reply
to
question
no.
4
,
which
state
:
on
5th
August
2021
,
a
Taisce
respond
to
the
Department
's
letter
note
the
concern
express
therein
and
confirm
that
they
be
"
fully
in
compliance
with
the
DPER
circular
13/2014
.
"
that
still
do
not
answer
the
question
about
the
issue
of
restrict
fund
and
whether
or
not
the
Department
be
fully
satisfied
that
there
should
have
be
,
within
the
final
account
,
specific
reference
to
Circular
13/2014
and
that
same
restrict
fund
.
I
be
wonder
if
,
with
the
agreement
of
my
colleague
and
the
chairman
,
we
can
ask
the
Department
for
further
clarification
on
question
Nosemcue
3
and
4
and
whether
there
be
a
obligation
for
specific
reference
to
the
department
of
Public
expenditure
and
Reform
Circular
13/2014
.
we
should
ask
how
the
Department
have
ask
question
and
satisfied
itself
that
a
Taisce
be
fully
compliant
with
that
circular
.
it
seem
that
the
Department
have
merely
say
it
accept
the
response
from
a
Taisce
.
that
be
my
interpretation
and
I
be
open
to
correction
on
that
and
to
guidance
from
the
chairman
.
I
would
like
to
interrogate
that
further
to
satisfy
my
mind
.
can
we
work
on
a
response
to
this
correspondence
from
the
Secretary
General
ask
for
a
further
articulation
of
Circular
13/2014
and
what
happen
when
the
Department
be
engage
with
a
Taisce
in
respect
of
that
circular
?
the
Secretary
General
state
:
there
be
robust
arrangement
in
place
to
monitor
funding
from
the
Department
to
a
Taisce
and
to
ensure
that
such
funding
be
in
compliance
with
the
condition
of
Circular
13/2014
.
this
include
service
level
agreement
,
ongoing
engagement
,
reporting
and
vouch
expenditure
.
I
be
still
not
satisfied
that
the
2019
account
be
as
they
should
have
be
.
if
the
Secretary
General
come
back
to
we
and
state
the
Department
be
absolutely
satisfied
it
have
do
everything
,
then
fair
enough
,
but
I
would
like
to
pursue
the
issue
a
little
further
,
if
I
may
.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will

we
will
seek

.
we
will
seek
that
.
we
will
seek

.
we
will
seek

.
we
will
seek
that
.
I
thank
the
chair
.
I
apologise
profusely
for
miss
the
entirety
of
the
meeting
thus
far
but
that
be
unavoidable
.
I
apologise
also
if
some
of
my
question
have
be
ask
and
answer
.
if
they
have
,
that
be
fine
.
I
can
take
the
answer
from
the
record
afterwards
.
I
want
to
talk
about
the
Cork
-
Dublin
line
.
there
be
a
announcement
of
approximately
‚Ç¨
91
million
,
as
I
understand
it
,
for
the
upgrading
of
that
line
to
ensure
that
the
speed
at
which
commuter
could
travel
between
Cork
and
Dublin
and
vice
versa
be
speed
up
.
I
want
to
get
a
deep
understanding
of
where
that
spend
be
go
and
how
it
be
propose
to
spend
the
money
.
I
understand
that
signal
upgrade
be
a
component
part
of
that
,
and
possibly
new
intercity
railcar
,
icr
.
I
could
be
wrong
but
Ms
Graham
will
clarify
that
for
I
.
the
reason
I
ask
be
because
,
while
I
be
a
weekly
traveller
on
the
Cork
to
Dublin
line
and
I
be
a
regular
DART
user
,
I
wonder
whether
the
Mark
4
engine
be
fit
for
purpose
in
a
modern
railway
infrastructure
and
whether
there
be
a
proposal
to
replace
that
with
more
energy
-
efficient
carriage
and
train
set
.
where
be
the
NTA
in
term
of
that
conversation
with
Irish
Rail
?
that
be
my
first
question
.
I
thank
Ms
Graham
.
the
other
issue
relate
to
correspondence
that
we
would
have
receive
in
relation
to
bus
shelter
.
person
may
ask
why
be
I
ask
a
question
about
bus
shelter
.
bus
shelter
be
important
to
people
who
do
not
have
they
own
transport
,
particularly
if
they
live
in
intermediate
town
.
for
instance
,
if
you
be
live
between
Cork
and
Limerick
in
a
town
such
as
Buttevant
,
which
have
be
wait
for
a
bus
shelter
for
a
number
of
year
,
it
be
entirely
appropriate
for
I
to
ask
where
the
NTA
be
in
term
of
the
provision
of
such
shelter
and
why
they
be
not
be
roll
out
at
a
quick
pace
to
ensure
that
we
encourage
more
people
to
use
public
transport
.
I
thank
Mr.
Creegan
.
I
appreciate
the
answer
.
I
use
Buttevant
as
one
example
and
I
be
unashamedly
parochial
in
this
sense
.
Buttevant
be
a
example
of
where
infrastructure
be
not
be
roll
out
in
town
and
village
that
depend
on
intercity
route
.
if
some
attention
could
be
give
specifically
to
Buttevant
,
I
would
be
very
grateful
for
that
.
my
final
question
relate
to
fare
structure
.
I
have
a
mountain
of
correspondence
with
the
NTA
in
respect
of
fare
structure
between
Mallow
and
Cork
.
Mallow
be
a
typical
example
of
a
town
that
be
within
commute
distance
of
a
big
city
and
where
I
perceive
that
there
be
a
inequality
as
between
the
commuter
who
commute
to
Cork
from
Mallow
and
the
person
who
travel
,
for
instance
,
from
Greystone
to
Pearse
Station
in
term
of
fare
structure
.
I
note
and
welcome
the
correspondence
that
I
have
receive
from
the
NTA
in
relation
to
the
introduction
of
commuter
fare
.
I
wish
to
raise
the
issue
of
commuter
fare
because
there
be
thousand
upon
thousand
of
people
who
will
make
the
modal
shift
from
car
to
train
if
the
fare
structure
be
right
throughout
the
country
.
Mallow
be
a
typical
example
of
that
.
the
soon
we
get
that
new
fare
structure
this
year
,
the
good
.
overnight
,
you
will
see
a
demand
for
that
service
among
student
,
worker
and
citizen
in
general
.
that
be
why
I
ask
the
question
about
the
Cork
-
Dublin
upgrade
in
relation
to
speed
.
if
we
can
get
more
rolling
stock
on
that
line
between
Cobh
,
Midleton
,
Cork
,
Mallow
and
Charleville
,
for
instance
,
and
open
up
new
intermediate
station
as
well
,
you
will
create
demand
.
quite
frankly
,
that
be
where
the
minister
be
at
.
that
be
where
the
citizen
be
at
.
the
more
the
NTA
can
influence
that
and
bring
that
about
,
the
more
positive
the
impact
it
will
have
for
citizen
.
if
there
be
a
confirmation
of
the
fact
that
commuter
fare
will
be
introduce
,
as
per
the
NTA
's
correspondence
to
I
already
,
I
would
welcome
that
.
that
be
my
final
question
.
can
I
get
a
response
to
that
?
I
thank
Ms
Graham
.
I
appreciate
that
.
yes
.
that
will
be
do
.
when
we
return
in
February
,
we
will
engage
with
Transport
Infrastructure
Ireland
.

will
be

I
welcome
the
refreshingly
honest
answer
to
the
question
we
be
pose
,
even
if
they
be
not
necessarily
the
answer
we
want
to
receive
.
I
will
continue
in
the
vein
of
ask
very
straight
question
.
I
will
start
by
ask
about
the
N73
,
especially
the
stretch
between
Mitchelstown
and
Mallow
.
have
Mr.
Walsh
ever
travel
that
road
?
may
I
cordially
invite
Mr.
Walsh
to
travel
that
road
as
soon
as
he
possibly
can
?
it
be
only
then
that
he
would
realise
just
how
awful
a
stretch
of
road
it
be
.
it
be
arguably
one
of
the
bad
national
secondary
route
in
the
country
.
be
that
as
it
may
,
I
welcome
that
there
be
a
allocation
in
respect
of
Annakisha
South
,
Clogher
Cross
and
Waterdyke
.
I
be
disappointed
,
however
,
that
the
parcel
for
2022
be
only
‚Ç¨
900000
.
I
be
seek
reassurance
that
a
notification
will
be
send
by
TII
to
Cork
County
Council
to
give
formal
notice
that
Cork
County
Council
can
move
to
go
to
tender
on
that
project
.
be
that
the
case
?
have
formal
notification
be
issue
to
Cork
County
Council
?
Mr.
Walsh
will
appreciate
the
point
I
be
make
.
if
TII
be
only
allocate
‚Ç¨
900000
this
year
out
of
a
budget
line
of
approximately
‚Ç¨
10
million
,
the
fear
be
that
Cork
County
Council
will
get
stuck
in
the
gap
.
let
I
just
finish
the
point
,
which
I
be
make
in
good
faith
and
respectfully
.
if
Cork
County
Council
get
stuck
in
the
gap
,
have
spend
‚Ç¨
900000
,
but
cannot
go
to
tender
,
it
cannot
proceed
to
spend
up
to
the
figure
of
‚Ç¨
10
million
.
I
be
seek
a
commitment
that
follow
2022
,
we
will
see
the
tender
issue
,
boot
on
the
ground
,
a
shovel
-
ready
project
and
that
TII
be
proceed
with
the
commitment
.
that
be
what
I
be
seek
here
.
let
I
reiterate
that
.
TII
be
issue
the
notice
to
Cork
County
Council
to
go
to
tender
and
there
will
be
a
budget
line
for
2022
to
2024
that
will
absolutely
deliver
that
project
.
I
thank
Mr.
Walsh
.
he
could
not
be
any
clear
than
that
,
which
I
appreciate
.
that
give
we
great
hope
.
I
refer
again
to
the
N73
and
other
such
project
.
have
TII
give
consideration
to
the
budget
line
for
major
scheme
in
relation
to
County
Cork
?
for
instance
,
the
Ballyvourney
to
Macroom
project
be
come
in
this
year
at
approximately
‚Ç¨
60
million
,
or
‚Ç¨
61
million
if
one
want
to
round
it
up
.
the
perception
hold
by
people
like
I
be
that
the
effect
of
all
of
the
money
go
into
the
Dunkettle
and
Macroom
bypass
of
this
world
,
which
be
the
subject
of
national
priority
,
be
to
suck
the
marrow
out
of
the
bone
for
other
small
project
.
I
acknowledge
that
they
be
small
road
and
less
priority
,
but
this
mean
that
people
like
I
be
fight
on
we
back
for
project
that
be
in
abeyance
for
five
,
ten
,
15
or
20
year
.
be
it
not
incongruous
that
,
if
a
road
be
a
national
priority
under
a
national
development
plan
and
so
on
and
it
be
politically
prioritise
at
government
level
,
it
should
have
a
negative
bear
on
a
local
authority
's
ability
,
in
partnership
with
TII
,
to
deliver
on
national
secondary
route
,
tertiary
route
and
so
forth
?
do
Mr.
Walsh
believe
that
there
should
be
a
rebalancing
of
priority
so
that
Exchequer
funding
for
national
secondary
route
,
which
be
usually
the
main
route
serve
county
,
do
not
get
catch
up
in
a
Samson
versus
Goliath
struggle
where
,
for
example
,
the
N73
be
complete
with
the
Macroom
bypass
?
the
perception
be
that
the
rest
of
the
county
be
pay
for
this
project
.
that
be
the
perception
.
fair
enough
.
I
will
move
on
.
the
minister
,
deputy
Eamon
Ryan
,
have
make
mention
of
the
efficacy
of
relief
road
.
I
hail
from
the
great
town
of
Mallow
.
there
be
a
budget
allocation
of
‚Ç¨
900000
for
the
Mallow
relief
road
,
which
be
welcome
and
we
be
delighted
.
it
have
be
a
long
-
run
campaign
,
as
have
the
N73
campaign
.
this
be
decade
-
old
campaign
.
what
will
the
‚Ç¨
900000
that
TII
have
allocate
for
the
Mallow
relief
road
get
we
?
once
spend
,
will
it
buy
a
further
commitment
that
the
relief
road
will
actually
be
deliver
?
this
be
a
bit
like
my
N73
.
I
thank
Mr.
Walsh
for
he
response
.
I
welcome
the
commitment
he
have
give
on
the
N73
.
it
give
I
some
hope
,
but
we
will
have
to
keep
a
eye
on
it
.
if
he
could
please
give
I
a
commitment
that
he
will
travel
that
road
himself
-----
do
that
will
absolutely
and
utterly
change
Mr.
Walsh
's
perception
or
give
he
first
-
hand
knowledge
of
just
how
bad
that
road
be
.
I
hope
it
might
cause
the
situation
to
move
more
rapidly
.
no
,
but
Mr.
Walsh
be
the
chief
executive
and
he
carry
a
great
deal
of
influence
.
I
raise
a
matter
with
the
Department
at
we
meeting
.
I
be
still
try
to
understand
what
the
future
of
art
and
antiquity
storage
will
look
like
for
the
State
.
we
be
give
chapter
and
verse
on
the
current
regime
in
north
County
Dublin
,
but
what
I
be
fail
to
understand
be
where
future
-
proofing
be
take
place
,
give
the
involvement
of
local
authority
,
local
museum
,
national
museum
,
national
collection
and
so
on
.
be
there
anything
in
the
language
of
the
letter
that
give
we
,
as
per
we
question
,
comfort
in
respect
of
the
future
-
proofing
of
what
I
euphemistically
call
the
national
collection
,
be
that
art
and
antiquity
,
statue
or
anything
else
?
I
be
not
sure
that
we
have
be
give
the
answer
,
but
I
remain
-----
as
the
Chairman
can
tell
,
I
be
ask
he
advice
and
I
thank
he
for
that
,
but
how
would
it
be
articulate
in
practical
term
short
of
bring
someone
back
to
the
committee
?
I
presume
it
would
be
do
via
further
correspondence
from
this
committee
to
the
line
department
.
I
be
in
the
late
fossilised
stage
myself
now
.
I
thank
the
chairman
.
we
can
anticipate
that
there
will
be
a
exponential
increase
in
the
type
of
work
.
New
technology
be
constantly
emerge
,
which
may
necessitate
the
need
for
a
permanent
and
fix
venue
or
venue
,
but
we
do
not
have
a
permanent
and
fix
venue
now
.
it
be
on
a
leasehold
basis
.
I
will
take
advice
from
the
Chairman
and
the
secretariat
,
as
I
wish
to
pursue
this
matter
further
.
forgive
I
if
I
be
slightly
ignorant
of
the
fact
in
this
case
,
but
what
do
a
sustainable
stand
-
alone
site
that
be
in
the
ownership
of
the
State
and
be
future
-
proof
and
cost
effective
look
like
?
I
raise
the
issue
in
the
context
of
seek
to
understand
how
each
of
the
line
Department
operate
its
relationship
with
a
Taisce
.
I
thank
the
committee
for
hold
this
item
over
until
this
week
.
I
want
to
get
a
deep
understanding
of
how
the
service
level
agreement
operate
between
nine
Department
that
be
funder
through
the
education
silo
of
a
Taisce
.
when
I
look
at
the
2019
account
and
the
various
circular
relate
to
the
operation
of
the
relationship
between
the
line
Department
and
a
Taisce
,
the
correspondence
come
back
to
we
reflect
a
concern
in
respect
of
seek
clarification
regard
the
2019
account
.
a
Taisce
's
2019
financial
statement
state
that
a
change
in
a
Taisce
policy
will
result
in
a
stipulation
for
a
small
allowance
for
organisational
cost
and
innovation
in
all
funding
agreement
go
forward
.
that
set
off
a
alarm
bell
in
my
mind
because
I
be
not
sure
whether
some
of
the
funding
that
be
specifically
for
programme
that
be
well
notify
to
we
,
such
as
the
Green
Flag
,
investigate
Forest
,
clean
Coast
and
the
Blue
Flag
,
be
be
bring
out
of
the
educational
silo
of
a
Taisce
,
which
deliver
many
of
the
programme
,
and
into
the
main
a
Taisce
body
.
that
be
the
concern
I
have
and
I
want
to
seek
clarification
.
base
on
the
correspondence
we
receive
back
,
it
seem
there
be
very
specific
engagement
between
the
funder
and
a
Taisce
in
respect
of
buttress
or
strengthen
service
level
agreement
or
review
current
service
level
agreement
or
contract
in
respect
of
that
funding
.
that
provide
one
with
a
degree
of
confidence
.
in
the
case
of
one
Department
,
which
I
think
be
the
Department
of
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
,
the
Department
clarify
this
be
not
compatible
with
public
financial
procedure
,
state
the
grant
money
must
be
spend
entirely
on
the
programme
the
Department
have
agree
to
fund
within
the
specific
condition
of
that
grant
and
that
failure
to
adhere
to
this
condition
could
result
in
funding
be
withdraw
and
possibly
the
recoupment
of
unapproved
expenditure
seek
or
other
legal
enforcement
.
the
impression
I
have
be
that
,
quite
literally
,
a
Taisce
be
take
a
bit
of
a
tranche
of
some
of
that
funding
-----
-----
and
allocate
it
to
a
Taisce
,
which
I
understand
be
essentially
a
membership
organisation
.
when
we
look
at
the
delivery
of
the
programme
I
reference
,
we
can
see
they
be
excellent
programme
and
we
be
very
lucky
to
have
a
organisation
like
a
Taisce
to
deliver
they
.
I
just
want
to
seek
clarity
on
that
.
base
on
the
correspondence
,
it
seem
individual
line
Department
be
take
a
rigorous
approach
to
interrogate
that
relationship
and
the
2019
account
.
I
be
not
a
financial
or
management
accountant
.
if
a
Taisce
be
a
membership
organisation
,
from
a
public
purse
and
financial
probity
point
of
view
,
do
each
of
that
line
Department
,
the
State
,
the
government
or
,
ultimately
,
the
taxpayer
have
a
right
to
look
at
the
financial
strength
or
otherwise
of
the
parent
organisation
when
they
be
fund
that
organisation
?
in
other
word
,
do
the
parent
organisation
have
to
be
in
a
solvent
position
before
it
can
receive
fund
?
that
be
just
a
curiosity
of
mine
.
the
reason
I
be
curious
about
that
be
because
if
,
on
a
Taisce
's
previous
year
's
financial
account
,
auditor
be
say
that
-
and
I
be
quote
from
its
financial
account
-
for
organisational
cost
and
innovation
and
all
funding
agreement
,
that
a
allowance
would
be
make
and
there
would
be
a
movement
of
some
of
the
money
then
,
one
wonder
,
why
that
be
the
case
if
a
Taisce
be
a
financially
robust
organisation
.
hopefully
,
that
can
be
clarify
for
I
.
it
may
not
be
within
the
remit
of
this
committee
to
have
that
clarify
.
again
,
I
seek
the
chair
's
wisdom
on
that
.
it
serve
a
vital
function
in
term
of
the
delivery
of
its
excellent
programme
,
and
it
permeate
out
with
citizen
proactively
involved
in
deliver
that
programme
.
it
have
build
a
consciousness
and
awareness
and
set
of
programme
that
have
have
a
massive
impact
in
community
at
the
most
local
level
.
it
be
important
that
we
preserve
that
and
protect
it
in
every
way
that
we
can
.
it
do
a
vital
piece
of
work
.
however
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
imagine
that
we
should
satisfy
ourselves
that
everything
that
be
be
do
be
absolutely
with
financial
probity
in
mind
.
I
would
like
to
hear
other
member
's
perspective
.
I
have
no
political
agenda
to
undermine
any
organisation
.
I
feel
I
have
to
put
that
on
the
record
.
clean
Coast
Ballynamona
be
in
my
constituency
.
I
raise
many
a
green
flag
myself
when
I
be
a
minister
of
State
.
the
chairman
will
know
from
the
tone
of
the
language
of
my
question
that
it
be
not
with
a
view
to
seek
to
undermine
any
organisation
.
I
state
very
clearly
on
the
record
the
great
work
that
a
Taisce
do
in
respect
of
the
delivery
of
the
programme
but
since
I
be
not
a
financial
or
forensic
accountant
,
I
have
to
rely
on
the
guidance
we
receive
from
the
secretariat
and
the
correspondence
we
receive
from
the
Department
.
we
be
fully
entitle
,
as
I
understand
it
,
to
ask
a
question
of
any
organisation
.
I
be
merely
pose
the
question
and
be
entitled
to
do
that
.
however
,
I
do
not
want
it
infer
that
,
because
I
have
ask
the
question
,
there
be
a
certain
political
motivation

I
take
grave
exception
to
that
.
it
be
wrong
that
it
should
be
infer
from
my
question
;
it
be
unfair
.
I
feel
aggrieved
by
the
fact
that
I
would
be
impugn
in
that
way
consequent
to
my
line
of
question
.
my
question
be
ask
with
a
view
to
seek
clarification

absolutely
not

absolutely
not

I
use
the
word
"
solvency
"
because
I
be
seek
to
find
fact
in

to
the
process
as
to
how
this
organisation
be
fund

I
do
not
see
how
the
deputy
be
load
the
basis
by
ask
that
question

it
be
merely
with
the
purpose
of
find
fact

for
that
word
to
be
weaponise
now
,
in
some
fashion
,
I
think
be
quite
patently
wrong
.
it
do
I
a
disservice
when
all
I
be
seek
to
do
be
find
fact
.
in
fairness
to
the
secretariat
,
it
have
put
together
a
very
comprehensive
response
.
I
want
to
state
for
the
record
that
the
response
we
get
from
the
Department
have
also
be
extremely
comprehensive
.
we
accept
that
.
I

Climate

the
articulation
of
all
of
this
for
deputy
like
I
,
who
represent
both
urban
and
rural
constituency
,
be
that
we
have
village
and
townland
that
be
be
split
down
the
middle
.
the
only
way
I
can
articulate
my
point
be
by
give
a
practical
example
and
that
be
the
village
of
Ballyhooly
,
in
north
County
Cork
.
typical
of
every
small
village
throughout
the
country
,
it
be
quite
literally
be
split
down
the
middle
in
that
part
of
it
be
to
be
provide
with
broadband
through
the
national
broadband
plan
and
the
other
part
be
to
be
provide
for
by
the
market
.
in
the
case
of
Ballyhooly
,
there
be
a
housing
estate
that
quite
literally
be
be
split
down
the
middle
in
this
regard
.
while
we
accept
that
the
market
be
provide
and
that
there
be
a
entity
call
NBI
,
as
public
representative
who
spend
a
lot
of
we
time
advocate
on
issue
such
as
access
to
broadband
,
particularly
in
the
current
climate
of
remote
working
,
we
find
it
hard
to
understand
why
there
be
not
a
great
degree
of
interoperability
or
connectivity
between
NBI
and
the
private
operator
to
solve
problem
and
ensure
provision
of
service
to
people
in
village
.
it
be
extremely
frustrating
.
can
Mr.
Hendrick
provide
any
reassurance
to
public
representative
like
I
that
people
in
Ballyhooly
and
every
village
like
it
throughout
the
country
who
want
to
get
connect
and
have
a
right
to
be
connect
will
be
guarantee
access
,
that
they
will
not
be
deny
access
in
the
time
we
live
in
?
I
appreciate
and
understand
all
of
that
.
when
the
national
broadband
plan
be
roll
out
there
be
a
expectation
-
Mr.
Hendrick
can
tell
I
if
it
be
not
a
legitimate
expectation
-
that
there
would
be
a
more
timely
intervention
in
that
area
where
there
be
serious
gap
.
I
refer
again
to
Ballyhooly
,
because
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
it
be
a
ground
zero
for
every
village
of
a
similar
type
.
there
be
a
expectation
that
there
would
be
a
realisation
of
the
commercial
reality
,
but
also
a
realisation
of
the
corporate
social
responsibility
of
ensure
that
where
there
be
gap
,
right
down
to
micro-
level
,
NBI
would
be
the
responsible
partner
in
ensure
that
where
public
representative
like
I
make
representation
through
we
broadband
officer
in
the
local
authority
or
directly
to
NBI
,
there
would
be
a
understanding
of
that
dynamic
and
there
would
be
move
to
fast
-
track
or
,
at
least
,
recognise
the
fact
that
there
be
household
wherein
there
be
two
parent
work
remotely
and
a
post
-
primary
or
third
level
student
who
be
quite
literally
take
turn
use
the
broadband
such
be
the
lack
of
capability
.
Mr.
Hendrick
speak
about
a
offering
by
nbi
of
minimum
speed
of
100
mbp
,
a
1g
product
and
a
new
2g
product
.
be
NBI
guarantee
that
speed
or
be
it
,
as
set
out
in
the
small
print
,
"
up
to
"
that
speed
.
there
be
a
big
difference
between
"
up
to
1g
"
and
actually
guarantee
1g
.
the
term
"
up
to
"
could
mean
anything
up
to
that
level
.
that
be
the
issue
that
we
be
try
to
deal
with
here
and
that
,
as
public
representative
,
we
be
try
to
navigate
.
we
be
quite
literally
reflect
back
to
NBI
what
we
be
hear
on
the
ground
from
countless
number
of
citizen
in
the
type
of
village
mention
,
who
be
deeply
frustrated
that
there
be
no
intervention
that
appear
to
be
serve
they
.
Mr.
Hendrick
be
tell
I
about
something
that
be
go
to
happen
in
the
future
,
the
future
be
now
as
far
as
that
people
be
concerned
.
the
pandemic
have
fast
-
track
remote
work
and
they
want
result
now
.
what
can
I
tell
the
people
of
Ballyhooly
arise
from
my
engagement
with
the
witness
today
that
would
give
they
some
hope
that
there
will
be
a
intervention
to
meet
they
need
and
they
will
get
a
service
?
thank
you
.
it
be
a
nice
segue
that
we
be
talk
about
the
reliance
on
external
advice
.
if
I
understand
Mr.
Griffin
correctly
,
he
be
talk
about
25
consultant
assign
to
the
roll
-
out
of
the
national
broadband
plan
.
I
submit
a
parliamentary
question
for
write
answer
on
19
January
of
this
year
ask
how
much
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Climate
and
Communication
be
spend
on
external
consultancy
service
.
the
figure
I
get
back
be
‚Ç¨
14.3
million
,
of
which
‚Ç¨
10.1
million
,
approximately
,
be
be
spend
on
external
service
for
this
very
project
.
if
I
break
that
down
further
-
and
the
reply
be
a
matter
of
public
record
-
Analysys
Mason
receive
‚Ç¨
3.9
million
,
EY
business
advisory
service
receive
‚Ç¨
5.3
million
and
William
Fry
legal
advisory
service
receive
‚Ç¨
846000
.
that
add
up
to
approximately
‚Ç¨
10.1
million
.
be
it
possible
to
give
a
further
breakdown
of
the
spend
between
the
three
entity
I
have
just
mention
?
the
reason
I
ask
the
question
be
that
I
perceive
that
in
latter
year
government
Department
have
be
hollow
out
and
there
be
a
increase
dependency
on
external
advice
.
none
of
we
be
against
the
idea
of
external
advice
.
it
need
to
be
procure
if
and
when
a
certain
skill
set
or
a
specific
project
need
to
be
deliver
.
that
be
understand
.
however
,
‚Ç¨
10.1
million
seem
to
I
to
be
a
extraordinary
figure
.
what
be
EY
's
business
advisory
service
,
for
example
?
the
consultancy
,
the
PQ
reply
state
,
be
for
financial
and
commercial
advisory
service
,
but
it
amount
to
‚Ç¨
5.3
million
,
which
be
not
a
insignificant
amount
of
money
.
be
it
possible
to
provide
the
committee
with
a
further
breakdown
of
that
cost
in
term
of
,
to
use
the
vernacular
phrase
,
billable
hour
?
what
be
the
department
get
for
‚Ç¨
5.3
million
?
what
be
it
get
from
Analysys
Mason
for
‚Ç¨
3.9
million
and
what
be
it
get
from
William
Fry
for
‚Ç¨
846000
so
far
?
that
be
only
for
2021
.
it
would
be
very
useful
if
this
committee
have
a
further
understanding
of
just
how
much
money
be
be
spend
on
consultancy
service
,
not
only
for
the
Department
of
the
environment
,
Climate
and
Communication
-
official
from
that
Department
be
here
today
-
but
for
every
Department
of
State
,
for
that
matter
.
I
thank
Mr.
Griffin
.
I
have
only
four
minute
and
Mr.
Griffin
have
take
a
fair
chunk
of
time
.
I
be
conscious
he
want
to
develop
the
point
but
I
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.
I
appreciate
that
.
what
I
would
like
be
a
deep
understanding
of
the
breakdown
of
this
cost
.
we
need
that
for
every
single
line
department
that
rely
on
external
service
and
consultancy
.
I
be
not
sure
we
have
a
deep
understanding
of
that
.
certainly
,
I
speak
for
myself
in
that
regard
.
the
question
then
,
and
Mr.
Griffin
can
fold
this
all
into
the
reply
in
two
minute
,
be
do
I
take
it
from
he
reply
that
the
Department
will
continue
to
require
the
service
of
external
consultant
for
this
?
if
the
answer
to
that
be
"
yes
"
,
which
I
think
it
be
,
for
how
long
more
will
it
require
they
?
it
have
spend
‚Ç¨
10.1
million
so
far
.
what
do
Mr.
Griffin
anticipate
the
future
spend
will
be
on
external
service
for
the
lifetime
of
this
project
?
with
respect
,
I
have
a
very
short
time
available
to
I
.
I
think
we
all
appreciate
that
there
be
a
reliance
on
external
service
.
we
have
all
acknowledge
that
.
I
be
merely
ask
at
this
juncture
-
I
think
Mr.
Griffin
be
about
to
defer
to
he
colleague
on
the
matter
-
about
the
breakdown
of
cost
and
to
have
sight
of
the
breakdown
of
that
cost
.
if
I
could
come
away
in
the
short
time
I
have
with
some
understanding
of
that
and
a
commitment
that
the
Department
will
write
to
the
committee
in
that
regard
,
I
would
be
grateful
for
that
.
on
the
legal
side
-----
with
respect
,
Mr.
Mulligan
should
understand
that
we
be
at
the
front
line
in
understand
people
's
need
.
we
be
the
people
who
run
constituency
office
.
we
understand
full
well
the
significance
of
the
nbp
.
we
also
understand
the
deficit
which
exist
in
respect
of
the
provision
of
the
broadband
service
.
I
think
that
be
self
-
evident
,
and
I
do
not
think
we
need
to
be
remind
of
it
.
I
be
,
however
,
concerned
about
the
standard
of
reply
that
my
office
receive
when
contact
be
make
via
the
dedicated
email
address
for
representation
to
NBI
.
I
would
like
to
see
a
great
degree
of
transparency
regard
the
number
of
representation
make
through
that
email
channel
and
how
many
of
that
representation
from
the
office
of
Deputy
and
Senator
be
actually
resolve
.
I
refer
to
a
broadband
connection
ultimately
be
make
.
whether
we
like
it
or
not
,
and
whatever
about
the
commercial
consideration
and
the
cost
,
the
fact
remain
that
a
expectation
be
create
that
a
service
would
be
roll
out
.
the
advent
of
the
Covid
-
19
pandemic
have
increase
or
fast
-
track
that
expectation
.
I
think
we
would
all
agree
on
that
point
.
therefore
,
a
demand
and
a
expectation
exist
for
this
service
,
which
I
think
be
a
legitimate
one
.
I
refer
to
people
in
particular
circumstance
of
which
we
be
all
aware
,
whether
down
dale
or
up
glen
,
where
there
be
a
expectation
of
be
able
to
work
remotely
.
sometimes
there
be
a
perception
that
people
in
rural
Ireland
have
particular
type
of
job
and
fulfil
particular
type
of
function
.
I
want
to
remind
everyone
that
the
people
in
rural
Ireland
be
the
people
with
phd
,
mba
,
master
,
and
they
be
work
remotely
across
pharma
and
academia
,
and
that
need
to
be
understand
.
they
need
the
access
;
that
be
the
bottom
line
.
they
be
professional
people
live
in
this
community
and
they
have
a
legitimate
expectation
.
if
there
be
one
thing
arise
from
today
it
be
that
the
quality
of
engagement
with
Oireachtas
Member
should
improve
such
that
we
can
expect
legitimately
that
,
when
we
make
representation
on
behalf
of
this
very
people
whom
I
be
talk
about
and
there
be
some
sort
of
priority
give
to
that
.
very
often
we
be
the
door
of
last
resort
for
this
people
because
they
have
try
every
other
option
,
give
they
be
more
than
capable
of
engage
with
the
commercial
provider
themselves
and
they
have
do
so
,
but
they
be
come
to
we
because
they
have
no
other
place
to
go
.
they
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
we
that
we
would
interface
with
representative
at
Nbi.ie
and
they
would
then
expect
,
and
we
would
expect
,
that
we
would
receive
some
sort
of
a
return
,
and
a
deliverable
.
the
deliverable
in
this
case
be
a
connection
ultimately
.
that
be
why
I
be
concerned
by
the
amber
map
from
day
one
.
I
do
not
profess
to
be
a
expert
in
;
I
be
a
layman
in
all
of
this
,
not
a
financial
wizard
.
I
have
no
technical
knowledge
in
respect
of
network
or
telephony
,
but
I
do
know
what
the
need
of
my
constituent
be
.
I
do
not
see
how
,
in
this
day
and
age
,
there
be
not
some
blend
of
service
that
could
be
provide
that
be
a
solution
for
each
household
.
I
do
not
think
there
be
anything
that
be
insurmountable
by
way
of
a
solution
for
every
household
give
the
paradigm
shift
that
have
take
place
.
that
be
where
people
like
be
come
from
,
quite
simply
.
we
need
to
get
information
back
to
this
committee
in
respect
of
how
many
representation
have
be
receive
by
Oireachtas
Member
and
how
many
of
that
have
be
resolve
whereby
a
connection
be
make
.
we
need
some
qualitative
and
quantitative
analysis
of
that
representation
in
term
of
whether
they
be
succeed
through
we
intervention
.
my
second
point
relate
to
the
bcp
.
how
many
bcp
be
up
and
run
and
live
as
we
speak
?
what
I
raise
with
NBI
be
a
outworking
of
this
very
issue
.
I
would
like
Mr.
Griffin
to
go
away
from
this
meeting
understanding
that
there
be
a
little
village
in
north
County
Cork
call
Ballyhooly
,
and
I
deliberately
use
the
example
of
Ballyhooly
because
he
will
remember
that
name
.
there
be
a
new
estate
in
Ballyhooly
call
Lios
Ard
,
people
by
the
professional
I
be
talk
about
from
all
walk
of
life
,
and
one
half
of
the
village
can
get
broadband
and
the
half
other
cannot
.
this
be
why
I
be
frustrate
by
this
amber
mapping
.
we
all
buy
into
it
and
now
it
seem
that
this
amber
map
have
become
such
a
arbitrary
tool
that
we
be
go
to
end
up
with
a
situation
where
there
will
be
that
people
who
will
have
and
that
who
will
not
all
because
of
a
mapping
exercise
,
ultimately
.
I
do
not
know
what
can
be
do
about
that
.
the
question
be
:
what
can
I
tell
the
people
in
Lios
Ard
,
Ballyhooly
,
tomorrow
morning
?
they
be
representative
of
thousand
of
people
throughout
this
State
.
what
hope
can
I
give
they
tomorrow
morning
that
they
be
go
to
be
guarantee
a
connection
?
that
be
the
bottom
line
.
that
be
ultimately
what
people
want
to
hear
.
like
my
colleague
,
deputy
O'Connor
,
we
will
be
have
a
chat
after
this
meeting
.
I
thank
Mr.
Griffin
for
that
clarification
.
sometimes
in
the
back
and
forth
,
in
particular
in
this
hybrid
situation
,
it
can
be
a
little
difficult
for
both
member
and
witness
to
get
they

there
can
sometimes
be

on
Thursday
,
17
February
,
when
we
will
engage
with
the
Department
of
Housing
,
local
Government
and
Heritage
.
I
will
follow
on
from
my
colleague
,
deputy
Dillon
,
regard
the
inspection
regime
.
I
understand
there
be
a
set
of
regulation
go
back
to
2019
relate
to
standard
in
private
rent
accommodation
,
which
be
very
clearly
delineat
.
I
be
strike
by
the
fact
,
notwithstand
Covid
-
19
and
the
inability
of
people
to
inspect
private
rent
accommodation
that
be
subject
to
housing
assistance
payment
,
or
even
the
rental
accommodation
scheme
as
we
use
to
know
it
,
of
the
dramatic
drop
-
off
in
the
number
of
inspection
take
place
.
the
minister
's
response
to
a
parliamentary
question
I
pose
on
25
January
clearly
show
that
up
to
quarter
3
of
2021
,
11731
inspection
take
place
.
that
be
the
most
up
-
to
-
date
figure
I
have
.
there
may
have
be
a
advance
on
that
since
then
.
it
be
2021
.
we
be
factor
in
Covid
-
19
.
we
know
there
will
be
a
drop
-
off
so
the
official
do
not
need
to
respond
to
that
.
that
be
a
give
and
that
be
understand
,
but
the
number
of
prohibition
notice
that
have
be
serve
out
of
that
inspection
be
15
.
even
if
we
track
back
,
take
into
account
Covid
-
19
,
in
2018
,
approximately
28000
inspection
be
carry
out
with
99
prohibition
notice
serve
.
in
2019
,
40000
inspection
be
carry
out
with
106
notice
serve
.
in
2020
,
approximately
26000
inspection
be
carry
out
with
57
notice
serve
and
,
as
I
say
,
there
be
11700
inspection
up
to
quarter
3
of
2021
with
15
notice
serve
.
do
the
official
agree
that
the
number
of
prohibition
notice
serve
be
extremely
low
?
I
ask
that
because
I
have
visit
people
of
late
who
be
in
receipt
of
the
housing
assistance
payment
.
to
describe
the
condition
they
be
live
in
as
Dickensian
would
be
to
put
it
mildly
.
I
understand
the
local
authority
have
a
tough
job
to
do
,
but
I
would
like
to
see
some
language
come
from
the
Department
in
respect
of
buttress
the
inspection
regime
by
way
of
ensure
there
be
a
clear
policy
that
the
regulation
,
which
be
lay
down
in
law
,
be
adhere
to
such
that
people
have
the
right
to
live
in
some
sort
of
decent
accommodation
.
I
invite
the
official
to
visit
some
of
this
dwelling
for
themselves
.
they
will
see
just
how
poor
the
level
of
accommodation
be
.
this
people
be
catch
in
a
major
bind
because
they
cannot
go
back
to
they
landlord
to
ask
he
or
she
to
fix
this
or
that
as
they
would
be
out
on
they
ear
before
they
know
it
.
this
be
a
major
issue
right
across
society
when
we
be
pay
‚Ç¨
465
million
on
the
housing
assistance
payment
.
we
should
look
at
the
rent
supplement
figure
from
the
Department
of
social
Protection
for
2021
.
under
what
we
call
provisional
expenditure
under
the
supplementary
welfare
allowance
scheme
2021
,
the
Department
of
social
Protection
pay
out
‚Ç¨
122957,0
in
rent
supplement
.
we
be
pay
out
a
massive
amount
of
money
.
I
can
understand
why
we
be
do
so
.
we
need
to
keep
people
in
housing
in
the
private
rent
sector
until
supply
be
sufficiently
provide
for
,
but
the
inspection
regime
be
just
not
work
.
I
ask
the
official
to
please
not
come
back
to
I
with
Covid
-
19
as
a
reason
.
a
regime
need
to
be
put
in
place
such
that
the
inspectorate
be
robust
and
local
authority
be
resource
commensurate
with
the
number
of
property
in
they
purview
.
that
be
something
that
need
to
be
address
urgently
.
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
have
give
we
the
metric
of
60000
tenancy
and
‚Ç¨
465
million
,
which
be
come
in
at
,
give
or
take
,
‚Ç¨
7,800
per
tenancy
.
obviously
,
there
have
be
no
provision
to
revise
upwards
the
rent
provision
to
reflect
the
market
in
2017
.
the
Secretary
General
will
tell
I
there
be
a
working
group
on
that
but
there
need
to
be
a
great
degree
of
urgency
.
if
I
could
have
a
answer
to
that
in
two
minute
or
less
,
I
would
be
delighted
because
there
be
one
other
issue
I
would
like
to
cover
as
well
.
to
be
very
clear
so
there
be
no
ambiguity
,
what
I
actually
say
be
that
there
need
to
be
great
resourcing
of
the
local
authority
to
provide
for
personnel
to
carry
out
the
inspection
.
that
be
the
key
point
.
the
question
be
:
will
additional
resource
be
provide
to
local
authority
to
carry
out
more
inspection
?
it
be
on
the
Department
's
agenda
as
a
priority
.
I
thank
Ms
Timmons
.
I
appreciate
the
answer
.
with
regard
to
water
service
,
as
a
typical
deputy
try
to
get
scheme
up
off
the
ground
in
regard
to
wastewater
treatment
plant
and
sewage
treatment
plant
,
and
generally
improve
the
condition
of
service
,
in
particular
water
service
,
I
recognise
that
some
very
good
project
be
under
way
right
across
the
country
under
the
ambit
of
Irish
Water
.
however
,
I
be
try
to
understand
what
be
the
dynamic
that
be
inform
the
relationship
between
Irish
Water
and
the
local
authority
.
be
it
the
case
that
the
service
level
agreement
that
be
in
place
between
the
two
entity
will
be
set
aside
,
such
that
all
staff
be
now
to
transfer
across
to
Irish
Water
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
what
be
the
status
of
that
process
?
that
be
the
first
question
.
the
second
question
relate
to
whether
a
scheme
will
be
provide
where
there
be
small
settlement
or
village
where
the
local
authority
be
ready
to
go
on
a
project
,
but
it
be
not
necessarily
on
a
priority
list
for
Irish
Water
.
be
there
scope
for
the
Department
to
step
in
to
provide
funding
for
local
authority
for
small
scheme
that
be
shovel
-
ready
and
that
could
get
off
the
ground
?
it
would
have
tremendous
impact
.
if
we
do
not
have
that
type
of
scheme
,
people
be
subject
to
a
Irish
Water

24
February
,
when
we
will
engage
with
the
residential
Tenancy
board
on
its
2020
financial
statement
.
to
continue
on
a
similar
vein
to
the
chairman
,
in
respect
of
HSE
national
service
plan
and
its
relationship
with
the
health
vote
,
be
Mr.
Reid
aware
of
the
report
commission
by
the
Parliamentary
Budget
Office
?
Mr.
Reid
will
be
aware
that
the
report
state
,
''
the
programming
of
expenditure
under
the
Health
vote
be
another
priority
of
future
Health
and
alig
the
programme
of
vote
38
with
the
HSE
's
internal
allocation
would
make
the
relationship
between
what
the
Oireachtas
approve
and
what
be
spend
on
the
ground
more
direct
.
''
the
key
word
there
be
''
what
the
Oireachtas
approve
''
.
we
be
elect
by
the
people
and
we
approve
the
expenditure
,
and
the
HSE
spend
the
money
and
have
that
relationship
with
the
Department
of
Health
and
the
line
minister
of
the
day
.
ultimately
,
there
be
a
accountability
mechanism
here
.
the
Comptroller
and
Auditor
General
hold
a
constitutional
position
.
if
he
be
make
reference
in
he
open
remark
to
that
specific
report
,
that
report
have
to
be
take
seriously
by
the
HSE
.
it
be
important
.
let
we
not
make
light
of
it
.
it
be
a
vital
transparency
mechanism
.
on
the
accountability
mechanism
,
consider
what
happen
when
a
mere
mortal
like
I
,
who
represent
the
people
of
Cork
East
,
submit
a
parliamentary
question
on
CAMHS
,
as
I
do
in
January
when
I
seek
information
on
the
number
of
person
wait
to
be
see
by
CAMHS
by
local
health
office
,
in
tabular
form
,
and
the
length
of
time
person
be
wait
to
be
see
.
it
be
a
very
simple
question
and
the
response
I
get
be
comprehensive
,
which
be
to
the
credit
of
Mr.
Ryan
.
the
response
be
that
the
total
number
of
person
wait
for
CAMHS
nationally
be
3,357
.
when
I
submit
a
further
parliamentary
question
,
ask
for
a
breakdown
of
service
provide
by
CAMHS
,
specifically
the
number
present
to
CAMHS
who
be
wait
for
psychology
service
,
the
reply
,
which
be
from
Mr.
O'Regan
,
the
head
of
operation
,
give
a
universal
figure
of
9554
for
psychology
service
alone
.
if
I
break
it
down
further
in
relation
to
CHO
4
,
the
CHO
I
be
most
familiar
with
,
I
get
a
total
of
682
people
wait
.
for
psychology
service
,
I
get
a
figure
of
approximately
3000
for
CHO
4
.
what
be
deeply
frustrating
for
we
in
represent
family
and
child
await
appointment
or
try
to
get
into
the
system
of
CAMHS
be
that
it
be
very
hard
to
get
accurate
information
in
real
time
in
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
when
we
table
parliamentary
question
,
it
be
very
hard
to
give
family
real
-
time
information
base
on
they
child
's
need
and
they
expectation
.
I
have
no
criticism
whatsoever
of
the
individual
who
work
in
CAMHS
,
who
be
try
to
do
they
good
and
work
through
all
the
need
of
family
daily
,
but
Mr.
Reid
have
to
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
serious
issue
in
respect
of
CAMHS
and
he
dataset
in
respect
of
interrogate
figure
in
that
regard
.
it
be
Kafkaesque
that
system
within
the
HSE
organisation
be
not
talk
to
each
other
properly
.
if
Mr.
Reid
cannot
even
come
up
with
proper
figure
for
I
when
there
be
glaring
contradiction
,
how
can
we
expect
to
have
confidence
in
he
approach
?
in
fairness
to
he
,
he
have
take
a
national
lead
on
the
Covid
pandemic
,
but
we
want
he
to
devote
the
same
energy
to
deal
with
CAMHS
,
its
management
and
,
ultimately
,
the
delivery
of
service
to
family
.
we
remain
to
be
convince
that
appropriate
resource
be
be
deploy
.
from
Mr.
Reid
's
level
of
management
down
,
more
need
to
be
do
.
how
do
he
answer
this
critique
-
I
do
not
call
it
a
criticism
-
of
how
we
as
politician
interface
with
the
service
?
I
accept
the
response
and
the
distinction
Ms
O'Connor
be
make
,
but
the
universal
and
most
important
point
be
that
we
still
have
3000
child
wait
.
what
be
the
current
status
of
the
child
's
disability
network
team
?
do
Ms
O'Connor
consider
they
to
be
work
?
be
Ms
O'Connor
aware
that
parent
be
come
to
Member
of
the
Oireachtas
say
they
feel
like
they
be
now
go
through
another
process
of
incessant
form
-
fill
and
that
the
service
be
move
further
and
further
away
from
they
?
again
,
it
be
almost
Kafkaesque
that
they
be
in
this
vortex
of
constant
form
-
fill
.
they
feel
extremely
frustrated
.
can
Ms
O'Connor
sympathise
and
empathise
with
they
experience
of
child
's
disability
network
team
so
far
?
absolutely
.
I
be
not
a
specialist
in
this
field
so
I
rely
on
the
information
be
impart
to
I
by
the
HSE
.
would
person
-
to
-
person
intervention
not
have
be
the
starting
point
anyway
as
oppose
to
send
people
into
a
assessment
process
that
some
family
describe
as
nightmarish
?
I
be
go
to
leave
it
at
that
because
I
have
three
minute
leave
in
my
slot
.
I
ask
we
guest
to
have
regard
to
that
and
to
be
conscious
of
the
point
we
be
make
as
we
reflect
they
for
we
constituent
.
what
be
the
status
of
the
Owenacurra
Centre
?
I
be
tell
it
be
a
approve
centre
.
will
we
guest
explain
what
,
in
HSE
speak
,
a
"
approve
centre
"
be
?
the
Mental
Health
Commission
be
clear
in
its
definition
.
it
state
a
approve
centre
be
intend
"
to
provide
in
-
patient
treatment
to
people
suffer
from
mental
illness
.
the
MHC
maintain
a
register
of
all
approve
centre
.
"
the
chief
executive
state
the
HSE
be
go
to
move
to
close
the
Owenacurra
Centre
.
will
Mr.
Reid
reconsider
that
position
?
I
be
not
convinced
,
and
I
imagine
I
speak
comfortably
for
all
the
Member
of
the
Oireachtas
who
represent
the
Cork
East
constituency
,
there
be
a
proper
,
fit
-
for
-
purpose
local
alternative
solution
to
respond
to
the
centre
's
closure
.
Mr.
Reid
make
reference
in
he
open
remark
to
Glenwood
,
but
from
what
I
can
see
in
the
planning
application
,
that
be
not
to
be
designate
as
a
approve
centre
.
in
fact
,
there
be
no
mention
of
the
fact
it
would
become
a
approve
centre
.
right
now
,
there
be
11
people
who
do
not
know
where
they
be
suppose
to
go
,
yet
they
have
express
a
clear
will
and
preference
.
Mr.
Reid
use
the
expression
"
will
and
preference
"
.
I
would
contend
that
as
long
as
they
continue
to
express
a
will
and
preference
to
stay
at
the
Owenacurra
Centre
,
they
should
be
allow
to
do
so
for
as
long
as
be
necessary
,
in
accordance
with
they
will
and
preference
.
I
do
not
believe
we
guest
have
present
to
we
a
fit
-
for
-
purpose
and
local
alternative
for
they
.
send
they
30
kilometer
up
the
road
be
not
a
solution
.
that
be
not
how
we
treat
people
in
this
day
and
age
.
if
they
continue
to
express
a
will
and
preference
not
to
move
,
that
must
be
respect
.
furthermore
,
the
money
the
HSE
have
spend
on
improve
the
Owenacurra
Centre
have
to
be
take
into
account
.
I
understand
more
than
‚Ç¨
359000
have
be
spend
there
since
2016
.
there
be
no
alternative
for
the
resident
at
present
.
we
guest
have
present
the
Carrigaline
centre
as
a
alternative
,
but
it
be
not
a
approve
centre
.
the
resident
-
11
soul
-
be
almost
be
cast
out
.
I
ask
Mr.
Reid
to
please
reconsider
and
to
have
a
bit
of
heart
in
respect
of
this
people
.
we
cannot
compel
it
to
come
because
it
be
not
accountable
to
the
committee
of
Public
Account
.
the
request
can
be
make
.
that
can
be
do
but
,
certainly
,
there
can
be
no
means
of
compelling
its
representative
to
attend
because
it
be
a
private
company
.
once
upon
a
time
,
it
be
a
semi-State
but
even
commercial
semi-State
be
not
compel
,
although
if
that
be
the
case
,
there
would
be
a
great
level
of
expectation
that
it
would
attend
.
at
this
stage
,
however
,
Eir
have
be
a
private
company
since
1999
.
I
suggest
,
to
be
fair
to
deputy
Dillon
,
that
we
put
it
off
until
the
next
meeting
of
the
committee
and
we
deal
with
it
then
,
finally
,
one
way
or
the
other
.
I
do
not
want
to
defer
it
any
long
.
be
that
agree
?
agree
.
the
next
item
on
the
agenda
be

the
committee
will
now
go
into
private
session
before
adjourn
until
24
March
2022
,
when
it
will
engage
with
the
Sustainable
Energy
Authority
of
Ireland
regard
its
2020
financial
statement
.
I
wish
to
talk
specifically
about
the
retrofit
of
house
.
a
very
good
report
be
issue
by
Age
Action
Ireland
in
respect
of
the
need
for
a
new
energy
poverty
strategy
.
the
exist
poverty
strategy
be
out
of
date
,
as
I
think
we
all
know
.
I
hope
to
get
a
sense
from
the
SEAI
of
where
it
sit
in
respect
of
ensure
scarce
resource
be
deploy
in
a
manner
that
ensure
that
people
who
be
on
very
low
income
and
who
live
in
fuel
-
impoverished
house
can
be
target
in
a
way
that
make
sure
the
resource
flow
down
to
that
who
be
most
in
need
.
the
new
national
retrofit
plan
,
which
be
part
of
the
climate
action
plan
for
2021
,
have
a
target
of
bring
500000
home
to
a
b2
building
energy
rating
by
2030
.
we
guest
can
question
my
figure
,
but
we
know
that
something
like
18400
retrofit
be
complete
in
2020
,
approximately
4000
of
which
raise
the
home
concern
to
a
b2
standard
.
we
must
,
of
course
,
take
the
pandemic
and
the
associate
challenge
around
meeting
target
into
account
.
that
be
challenging
in
term
of
meeting
target
.
I
want
to
get
a
sense
from
SEAI
,
from
a
corporate
point
of
view
,
whether
it
see
its
role
as
one
that
ensure
it
be
not
just
people
with
means
who
take
the
lion
's
share
of
the
grant
available
for
retrofit
because
right
now
that
be
the
case
,
and
we
can
argue
justifiably
that
that
be
the
case
.
I
want
to
make
sure
we
have
a
system
in
place
that
ensure
people
who
be
fuel
impoverished
and
who
be
on
low
income
get
a
great
chunk
of
that
grant
aid
.
I
appreciate
that
.
we
be
all
talk
the
language
of
the
just
transition
but
nobody
have
be
able
to
identify
what
that
mean
in
real
term
.
Dr.
Byrne
talk
about
"
energy
poor
"
,
but
that
do
not
necessarily
mean
income
poor
.
a
distinction
have
to
be
make
here
.
I
could
be
live
in
a
well
-
appoint
,
high
-
value
house
in
south
Dublin
,
for
instance
-
I
do
not
mean
to
unfairly
target
south
Dublin
or
characterise
it
in
a
particular
way
-
and
it
could
be
worth
up
to
‚Ç¨
1
million
,
but
it
could
be
energy
poor
.
yet
,
the
income
come
into
the
house
might
a
multiple
figure
of
what
might
be
come
into
a
typical
1970
bungalow
in
rural
north
Cork
,
for
instance
.
in
the
income
level
there
could
be
a
massive
disparity
.
I
be
seek
a
understanding
from
SEAI
on
whether
or
not
government
policy
be
be
direct
to
ensure
that
SEAI
target
fuel
-
impoverished
or
energy
-
impoverished
home
,
but
also
household
where
the
income
level
be
much
low
.
that
be
the
key
.
forgive
I
if
I
be
misinterpret
Dr.
Byrne
but
I
think
he
say
that
he
role
be
not
in
respect
of
social
policy
and
income
threshold
,
but
purely
on
E
,
F
,
G
rate
home
and
target
they
.
however
,
you
could
be
live
in
a
E
,
F
or
G
BER
-
rate
house
and
be
a
multimillionaire
with
plenty
of
cash
in
the
bank
.
I
be
try
to
get
a
sense
as
to
whether
the
SEAI
have
receive
direction
from
the
government
from
the
point
of
view
of
have
a
social
policy
instrument
that
target
people
who
depend
on
the
State
for
they
income
,
who
be
on
meagre
pension
or
who
be
on
low
income
.
forgive
I
if
I
be
repeat
question
that
may
have
be
ask
but
what
be
the
skill
set
require
?
what
be
the
scaling
up
of
the
skill
set
of
the
labour
force
in
order
to
meet
a
target
in
excess
of
500000
home
to
be
retrofit
?
where
do
the
SEAI
fit
into
the
conversation
that
be
happen
about
meet
the
labour
need
that
be
require
.
base
on
Dr.
Byrne
's
reply
to
early
question
,
be
I
to
understand
SEAI
's
policy
intervention
in
relation
to
granting
of
high
-
end
evs
be
leave
it
to
the
market
to
decide
on
where
the
technology
will
land
?
do
that
mean
that
when
the
technological
solution
become
cheap
,
that
be
where
thing
will
land
in
term
of
a
demand
,
supply
and
a
price
point
?
I
ask
this
because
,
base
on
Dr.
Byrne
's
previous
reply
in
respect
of
electric
vehicle
,
that
while
it
have
build
in
threshold
in
term
of
grant
,
it
seem
it
be
ultimately
wait
for
the
market
to
decide
the
cost
of
the
vehicle
.
with
respect
,
I
be
not
sure
if
that
be
the
right
policy
intervention
.
I
would
be
glad
to
hear
he
view
on
that
.
the
wish
from
the
committee
,
which
I
want
to
try
to
reflect
,
be

we
have

I
,
too
,
welcome
the
Commissioner
and
he
colleague
to
we
committee
this
morning
.
I
would
like
a
good
understanding
of
the
Garda
National
Cyber
crime
Bureau
and
how
it
operate
.
how
many
investigate
garda√≠
or
officer
be
assign
to
that
unit
?
I
welcome
that
.
I
suppose
I
be
try
to
get
at
whether
it
be
see
as
a
priority
for
a
Garda
S√≠och√°na
on
the
basis
of
the
growth
of
cybercrime
.
it
be
now
such
a
vast
area
of
crime
.
it
be
a
relatively
new
frontier
or
phenomenon
.
one
worry
that
not
enough
resource
be
be
deploy
at
the
coalface
to
meet
the
crime
detection
requirement
.
if
one
could
be
disabus
of
that
notion
,
it
would
certainly
give
some
confidence
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
appreciate
the
answer
.
if
the
figure
on
personnel
be
make
available
to
the
committee
,
they
would
certainly
be
very
useful
to
we
.
a
statement
of
the
Garda
Commissioner
's
intention
from
a
policy
point
of
view
to
increase
the
number
of
staff
in
the
cybercrime
unit
would
give
the
public
some
confidence
also
.
I
just
want
to
move
on
to
-----
by
my
calculation
,
that
be
move
up
to
380
.
could
I
move
on
to
the
justice
plan
?
the
Commissioner
make
reference
to
the
digital
recording
Bill
.
the
Garda
Representative
Association
have
be
very
strong
on
the
need
for
body
-
wear
camera
,
bodycam
,
unit
.
this
will
be
legislate
for
in
the
digital
recording
Bill
,
presumably
.
what
engagement
have
the
commissioner
have
with
the
Minister
for
Justice
on
that
Bill
?
assume
that
the
Bill
become
law
,
how
will
the
Garda
deploy
resource
?
while
my
question
be
theoretical
in
advance
of
the
legislation
be
pass
,
I
be
sure
the
commissioner
be
plan
for
the
eventuality
of
body
-
wear
camera
be
roll
out
.
I
would
like
a
sense
of
he
perspective
on
this
issue
and
how
he
envisage
the
technology
be
deploy
as
a
resource
for
garda√≠
.
I
thank
the
commissioner
.
I
have
less
than
one
minute
leave
.
I
want
to
dovetail
with
deputy
Colm
Burke
's
point
in
respect
of
Macroom
.
the
issue
relate
to
Macroom
be
important
for
policing
in
a
entire
region
,
as
the
commissioner
can
imagine
.
it
be
quite
literally
police
from
the
Kerry
border
over
to
the
Waterford
border
and
north
to
county
Limerick
and
Tipperary
.
that
be
not
a
insignificant
area
.
it
be
arguable
that
Fermoy
,
which
be
the
pre-exist
divisional
headquarters
in
County
Cork
,
be
a
building
that
be
fit
for
purpose
when
it
be
construct
but
that
be
no
long
suitable
.
until
Macroom
come
on
stream
,
a
increase
number
of
garda√≠
will
be
go
into
pre-exist
infrastructure
.
I
wonder
what
kind
of
affect
that
have
on
the
morale
of
garda√≠
when
they
be
go
into
building
that
be
substandard
or
not
fit
for
purpose
.
what
we
want
be
modern
building
for
garda√≠
to
police
from
.
that
would
be
my
humble
opinion
.
I
be
sure
if
one
be
in
a
fit
-
for
-
purpose
building
,
one
's
morale
be
that
bit
high
and
so
forth
.
I
support
deputy
Colm
Burke
's
point
about
the
need
to
ensure
resource
be
deploy
.
I
might
have
view
with
regard
to
Fermoy
and
Mallow
,
for
instance
.
I
might
be
a
bit
parochial
about
the
fact
that
we
find
it
strange
that
it
be
go
to
Macroom
,
but
that
be
a
matter
of
policy
.
we
need
to
ensure
that
resource
be
deploy
in
term
of
capital
expenditure
on
building
,
however
,
and
they
need
to
be
roll
out
as
quickly
as
possible
.
that
be
the
general
point
in
support
of
deputy
Colm
Burke
.
that
be
fine
.
no
other
item
of
correspondence
have
be
flag
.
the
next
issue
be
the
work
programme
.
on
7
April
,
we
will
continue
we
series
of
justice
-
related
meeting
with
two
engagement
.
we
will
examine
the
financial
statement
of
the
Garda
S√≠och√°na
Ombudsman
Commission
that
morning
and
that
of

the

Authority

I
welcome
the
witness
and
acknowledge
the
presence
of
we
former
colleague
,
Mary
Harney
.
she
be
very
welcome
.
any
dealing
I
have
have
with
she
have
always
be
honourable
,
honest
and
straightforward
.
although
very
rarely
have
I
agree
with
she
from
a
politically
ideological
position
,
I
have
to
say
that
my
dealing
with
she
have
always
be
honest
,
straightforward
and
forthright
.
could
I
focus
on
the
funding
position
in
respect
of
the
hea
?
base
on
correspondence
we
have
receive
,
we
be
give
to
understand
that
core
funding
amount
to
‚Ç¨
1.7
million
have
be
withheld
to
date
.
be
that
the
current
position
?
so
contrary
to
media
report
,
no
further
money
have
be
withheld
.
the
reason
I
be
ask
Professor
Mey
this
question
be
because
right
now
,
the
educational
landscape
within
the
State
be
such
that
there
be
employee
of
university
or
technological
university
on
precarious
contract
.
to
my
knowledge
,
there
be
not
enough
people
in
proper
career
progression
.
many
lecturer
be
still
below
the
bar
and
be
go
from
contract
to
contract
.
I
speak
for
staff
within
the
University
of
Limerick
.
it
seem
to
I
that
if
there
be
a
withdrawal
or
hold
back
of
funding
,
it
stymy
the
ability
of
the
university
to
fulfill
its
mission
and
obligation
to
its
own
staff
but
also
its
wide
mission
to
the
mid-
and
Munster
region
.
I
say
this
as
a
former
minister
of
State
with
responsibility
for
research
and
innovation
.
I
be
very
much
aware
of
the
work
of
EPI
-
STEM
,
Lero
and
other
such
entity
and
the
translational
effect
of
the
research
provide
by
the
University
of
Limerick
.
I
worry
that
if
the
HEA
be
withhold
funding
,
it
will
have
a
downstream
effect
on
the
university
's
ability
to
allow
staff
to
progress
from
below
the
bar
to
above
the
bar
position
or
to
allow
the
university
to
ensure
that
people
progress
and
that
there
be
a
career
path
for
employee
within
the
university
.
be
it
the
case
that
the
hold
back
of
this
funding
be
affect
staff
's
ability
to
progress
?
why
have
this
money
be
pause
?
what
reason
be
give
in
that
conversation
between
the
minister
,
deputy
Harris
,
and
the
president
?
move
on
then
to
what
be
reasonably
modest
but
significant
sum
nonetheless
in
respect
of
what
have
be
spend
on
external
consultancy
cost
and
adviser
fee
,
the
university
spend
nearly
‚Ç¨
600,000
on
project
management
service
,
total
legal
expenditure
be
‚Ç¨
926000
,
estate
planning
be
‚Ç¨
250000
,
brand
refresh
and
implementation
be
‚Ç¨
87000
,
and
public
relation
be
‚Ç¨
33000
.
this
be
all
money
that
have
be
spend
on
external
service
.
will
the
president
tell
I
why
the
university
spend
‚Ç¨
595000
on
project
management
service
and
what
be
this
service
?
that
be
my
first
question
for
she
.
also
,
in
respect
of
the
brand
refresh
and
implementation
,
‚Ç¨
87000
would
pay
the
fee
for
one
lecturer
above
the
bar
,
if
I
can
put
it
that
way
.
my
focus
here
be
on
staff
and
student
,
on
what
they
be
receive
and
on
what
I
would
call
they
rights
and
entitlement
.
it
seem
to
I
the
amount
of
money
,
which
be
approximately
‚Ç¨
3.1
million
and
be
a
significant
amount
,
be
all
money
that
have
be
in
spend
on
external
service
that
could
reasonably
have
be
expect
to
be
plough
into
invest
in
staff
,
educational
output
,
and
research

on

the

follow
:
"

"
at
this
stage
I
open
the
correspondence
to
the
member
for
further
discussion
.
as
we
have
previously
discuss
,
there
be
a
genuine
expectation
that
the
role
and
remit
of
this
committee
would
be
expand
.
this
be
articulate
through
interaction
I
have
as
Chairman
when
attend
the
work
Group
of
Committee
Chairmen
.
it
be
a
statement
of
fact
that
the
role
and
remit
of
this
committee
have
be
reduce
relative
to
the
equivalent
committee
that
sit
under
the
previous
d√°il
.
it
be
arguable
that
if
we
be
the
first
line
of
contact
for
the
petitioner
,
the
citizen
,
it
be
perhaps
not
adequate
that
the
committee
's
role
would
be
reduce
to
such
a
extent
that
we
be
leave
only
to
consider
sectoral
committee
ombudsman
report
that
have
not
be
consider
within
a
two
-
month
period
in
the
various
sectoral
committee
.
in
other
word
,
we
be
leave
only
to

that
sectoral
report
that
have
not
be
consider
by
other
committee
and
petition
that
come
before
we
.
I
open
the
floor
to
the
member
to
give
they
opinion
on
the
role
and
remit
of
the
committee
.
member
be
unanimous
in
they
view
that
there
be
a
role
for
the
committee
.
there
be
a
legitimate
expectation
in
we
interaction
with
the
work
Group
of
Committee
chairmen
that
its
role
would
be
expand
,
that
it
would
not
seek
to
duplicate
the
work
of
other
committee
but
would
work
to
complement
it
.
if
a
issue
of
public
policy
arise
at
this
committee
,
for
instance
,
it
be
to
liaise
with
the
sectoral
committee
and
seek
to
have
a
workflow
that
would
not
necessarily
be
facilitate
in
the
sectoral
committee
because
of
the
sheer
volume
of
work
be
do
by
it
.
we
be
all
member
of
other
committee
.
I
do
not
understand
why
the
sub
-committee
on
D√°il
reform
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
do
,
but
we
have
agree
that
we
will
write
to
it
and
seek
to
engage
further
with
it
.
as
have
be
say
,
there
be
a
legitimate
role
for
the
committee
.
this
be
the
first
line
of
contact
for
people
if
they
wish
to
raise
a
issue
and
see
it
elevate
within
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
.
the
key
point
be
that
we
be
not
try
to
invade
the
pitch
of
other
,
so
to
speak
,
but
we
be
try
to
complement
the
work
of
other
committee
.
we
could
play
a
very
relevant
role
in
that
respect
.

principal
,
they
get
the
shock
of

never

they
then
realise

p00026/17
from
Ms
Aideen
Darmody
seek
the
removal
of
the
statue
of
Prince
Albert
from
the
grounds
of
Leinster
House
on
the
basis
that
it
pay
tribute
to
a
monarch
whose
value
be
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
Irish
Republic
.
the
petitioner
suggest
that
the
statue
be
auction
and
the
proceed
donate
to
a
homeless
charity
.
we
have
receive
correspondence
from
the
Superintendent
of
the
House
of
the
Oireachtas
state
that
the
house
do
not
own
the
statue
of
Prince
Albert
and
that
information
on
its
ownership
can
be
supply
by
the
Office
of
Public
Works
art
management
unit
.
the
physical
implication
and
potential
cost
of
remove
the
statue
would
also
be
well
answer
by
the
opw
.
the
statue
date
back
to
the
Royal
Dublin
Society
's
ownership
of
Leinster
House
.
it
be
worth
note
that
the
sculpture
be
do
by
John
H.
Foley
,
who
be
a
renowned
sculptor
.
the
proposal
before
we
be
to
deem
the
petition
inadmissible
under
stand
Order
111c
(

)
(
a
)
because
it
be
ask
the
d√°il
to
do
something
that
it
do
not
have
the
power
to
do
.
when
we
discuss
this
in
private
session
,
the
view
be
that
the
committee
do
not
wish
to
have
the
statue
remove
,
that
it
should
remain
but
that
it
would
be
pertinent
to
seek
clarification
from
the
OPW
or
the
power
that
be
as
to
who
own
the
statue
.
however
,
I
wish
to
have
a
discussion
and
will
seek
member
's
view
.
I
thank
the
member
for
share
they
view
.
it
be
the
view
of
the
committee
that
the
statue
should
remain
.
from
a
technical
point
of
view
the
petition
be
deem
inadmissible
because
it
be
ask
we
to
do
something
we
do
not
have
the
power
to
do
.
however
,
it
be
a
interesting
one
.
deputy
Mitchell
be
right
.
sometimes
there
be
a
eclectic
range
of
petition
before
we
and
we
be
respectful
to
the
petitioner
but
there
be
a
clear
view
in
this
case
that
,
as
the
emeritus
professor
of
history
at
University
College
Cork
,
John
A.
Murphy
,
say
when
quote
from
George
Santayana
,
a
philosopher
poet
,
a
civilised
people
do
not
tear
out
the
page
of
history
,
it
simply
turn
they
over
.
we
acknowledge
the
presence
of
the
statue
and
that
it
be
symbolic
.
however
,
the
artistic
merit
attribute
to
the
statue
give
that
it
be
the
work
of
John
H.
Foley
probably
superseede
the
statue
's
subject
.
we
be
clear
on
we
position
and
I
thank
the
petitioner
for
-----
to
be
helpful
,
perhaps
we
should
establish
the
ownership
in
the
first
instance
.
we
have
agree
to
correspond
with
the
opw
on
that
.
perhaps
we
can
discuss
it
when
a
response
be
receive
.
to
respond
to
deputy
Mitchell
's
early
point
,
I
have
be
go
through
that
gate
for
ten
year
.
one
pass
the
statue
by
and
do
not
take
much
notice
of
it
,
to
be
honest
.
like
the
deputy
,
I
have
to
go
out
the
other
day
to
take
a
look
at
it
to
see
who
it
be
and
so
forth
.
it
take
I
a
while
to
find
it
.
it
be
quite
a
imposing
structure
but
it
be
hide
by
the
hedge
.
I
would
not
necessarily
opt
for
relocate
it
.
if
,
however
,
some
treatment
can
be
do
in
or
around
the
location
of
the
statue
by
the
OPW
or
the
internal
management
of
the
House
,
that
might
be
the
way
to
proceed
.
I
thank
the

30
extra
minute
.
Ms
O'Sullivan
be
request
that
the
Department

look
at
the
possibility
of
extend
the
length
of
time
of
the
English
paper
for
the

by
30
minute
to
allow
student
enough
time
to
complete
the
paper
.
before
we
commence
,
in
accordance
with
procedure
,
I
be
require
to
read
the
follow
.
by
virtue
of
section
17
(

)
(

of
the
Defamation
Act

they

member
be
remind
of
the
long
-
stand
parliamentary
practice
to
the
effect
that
they
should
not
comment
on
,
criticise
or
make

against
either
a

outside

House
or
a

,
either

I
remind
we
guest
,
as
we
indicate
in
the
committee
's
invitation
,
the
presentation
should
be
no
more
than
five
to
ten
minute
duration
.
I
be
propose
that
,
rather
than
read
out
the
submission
verbatim
,
because
all
of
the
member
have
receive
the
submission
,
if
the
witness
be
in
a
position
to
summarise
it
in
five
minute
or
so
then
we
can
have
a
question
and
answer
session
on
the
nature
of
the
submission
.
if
that
be
okay
,
I
will
call
Mr.
Farrell
to
open
the
proceedings
.
I
understand
that
approximately
60000
people
complete
the
examination
.
plus
four
individual
complaint
be
make
about
time
constraint
.
be
there
a
geographical
spread
in
term
of
the
four
complaint
?
do
they
come
from
one
entity
?
Mr.
Farrell
's
colleague
can
also
respond
to
my
query
.
it
be
reasonable
to
presume
that
if
there
be
only
four
complaint
from
various
part
of
the
country
then
the
vast
bulk
of
the
60000
people
who
participate
in
the
examination
be
satisfied
with
the
two
hour
allocation
.
I
do
not
mean
to
put
word
into
anybody
's
mouth
here
.
I
just
want
to
get
a
sense
of
the
matter
from
the
witness
.
some
of
we
be
under
time
constraint
today
and
I
apologise
to
the
witness
.
time
be
always
a
big
issue
here
.
I
know
the
committee
have
send
correspondence
to
the
witness
about
other
issue
as
well
but
I
want
to
open
up
the
debate
to
other
member
.
I
call
on
Senator
Kelleher
to
commence
.
for
clarification
,
be
that
under
the
statement
of
strategy
?
deputy
Eugene
Murphy
wish
to
intervene
but
with
regard
to
you
point
about
content
,
one
of
the
issue
we
highlight
related
to
the
role
of
Parliament
and
parliamentary
committee
.
we
perceive
that
there
be
a
phasing
out
of
that
knowledge
,
as
it
be
,
at
junior
cycle
level
.
I
be
rely
on
my
note
but
with
the
new
well
-
being
programme
the
current
civic
,
social
and
political
education
,
CSPE
,
be
be
phase
out
under
the
junior
cycle
reform
programme
.
where
lie
the
ability
of
student
to
glean
knowledge
on
the
role
of
Parliament
and
parliamentary
committee
,
for
example
?
the
complaint
desk
do
not
receive
11000
call
.
to
be
fair
,
give
the
degree
of
parent
and
pupil
power
we
have
this
day
and
give
that
11000
people
sign
the
petition
,
I
expect
people
know
they
rights
.
it
be
a
fair
question
.
I
thank
Mr.
Farrell
very
much
for
that
comprehensive
response
.
do
member
have
any
further
question
?
there
have
to
be
some
deconstruction
of
the
thinking
that
exist
heretofore
where
everything
be
gear
towards
the
terminal
exam
.
it
be
quite
a
struggle
for
many
school
to
try
to
deconstruct
the
pedagogical
element
and
the
content
aspect
of
this
.
where
a
school
be
gear
towards
try
to
squeeze
as
much
as
possible
in
to
the
terminal
exam
,
it
be
in
the
confine
space
of
time
because
they
be
get
the
desire
point
or
desire
result
for
the
onward
trajectory
towards
third
level
institution
and
so
on
.
the
previous
junior
cycle
be
part
of
that
trajectory
or
continuum
.
maybe
some
school
continue
to
struggle
in
this
regard
.
I
do
not
refer
specifically
to
Loreto
College
,
which
generate
this
petition
,
but
maybe
some
challenge
remain
in
the
system
around
try
to
deconstruct
some
of
that
thinking
.
this
give
voice
to
petition
of
this
nature
,
and
I
speak
in
general
term
.
the
committee
have
hear
absolutely
compelling
evidence
here
today
.
by
any
reasonable
or
objective
analysis
,
the
witness
have
give
a
very
robust
account
of
the
nature
of
the
correspondence
enter
into
with
the
petitioner
and
have
engage
willingly
and
openly
with
the
petitioner
.
the
witness
have
answer
all
of
the
question
on
the
time
challenge
.
the
research
and
qualitative
analysis
carry
out
clearly
show
that
the
time
be
not
such
a
issue
as
it
related
to
last
year
's
English
exam
and
that
people
be
able
to
get
to
the
question
in
a
timely
fashion
.
I
believe
the
committee
member
be
in
agreement
with
that
analysis
.
the
procedure
in
place
for
individual
student
to
interface
with
the
State
Examination
Commission
be
robust
;
in
this
instance
in
this
exam
,
there
be
only
four
people
in
the
State
who
make

p00016/18
and
be
receive
from
Ms
Sarah
Joyce
.
it
concern
orchestral
provision
in
Ireland
.
the
petitioner
believe
orchestras
be
a
intrinsic
part
of
we
culture
and
be
seek
to
call
a
halt
to
the
report
by
RT√â
on
the
review
of
its
orchestral
provision
and
the
establishment
of
a
national
strategy
on
the
matter
by
the
Department
of
Culture
,
Heritage
and
the
Gaeltacht
and
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
.
she
believe
it
be
not
a
matter
for
RT√â
alone
.
we
have
a
discussion
on
it
in
the
previous
session
.
the
Minister
for
Culture
,
Heritage
and
the
Gaeltacht
,
deputy
Josepha
Madigan
,
will
establish
a
oversight
group
,
to
be
chair
by
she
Department
,
to
begin
the
discussion
on
the
implementation
of
RT√â's
independent
report
and
ensure
the
successful
transfer
of
the
National
Symphony
Orchestra
to
the
National
Concert
Hall
,
NCH
.
in
addition
,
a
working
group
from
RT√â
and
the
NCH
will
undertake
consultation
with
the
staff
concerned
.
the
issue
be
worthy
of
further
discussion
.
for
the
purpose
of
clarification
,
in
some
respects
the
petition
have
be
supersede
by
the
fact
that
RT√â
have
reply
to
the
joint
committee
with
a
copy
of
the
independent
report
publish
on
23
April
.
it
be
worth
go
into
its
content
.
it
be
entitle
,
RT√â
Orchestras
:
ensure
a
Sustainable
Future
,
and
be
produce
by
the
former
director
of
BBC
Radio
and
BBC
News
,
Ms
Helen
Boaden
,
with
the
support
of
the
strategy
consulting
firm
Mediatique
.
the
review
look
at
the
good
way
to
provide
high
quality
and
sustainable
orchestral
service
for
the
Irish
public
and
cover
the
National
Symphony
Orchestra
and
the
RT√â
Concert
Orchestra
.
it
be
important
to
distinguish
between
the
two
.
the
report
's
core
conclusion
be
that
it
be
not
in
the
national
interest
for
either
of
the
two
orchestras
to
be
close
and
that
they
should
be
bring
up
to
full
strength
.
however
,
the
report
also
conclude
that
it
be
hard
to
see
how
RT√â
can
fund
even
the
current
level
of
provision
,
let
alone
cover
the
increase
in
budget
that
would
be
require
to
enable
the
orchestras
to
return
to
full
strength
and
undertake
touring
and
educational
programme
.
it
recommend
that
the
National
Symphony
Orchestra
be
establish
as
a
national
cultural
institution
in
its
own
right
,
or
as
part
of
the
National
Concert
Hall
,
and
be
fund
by
the
government
.
I
believe
committee
member
be
agree
to
a
further
discussion
on
the
matter
.
many
people
be
confused
about
what
be
go
on
.
many
of
we
absolutely
agree
that
the
output
of
both
orchestras
be
absolutely
vital
to
Ireland
's
cultural
life
,
but
it
be
also
pertinent
for
the
committee
to
agree
to
the
suggestion
that
we
invite
the
director
general
of
RT√â
to
come
to
give
we
its
perspective
on
the
issue
.
I
propose
that
we
do
not
close
the
petition
at
this
point
in
order
that
we
can
have
that
further
discussion
.
we
can
then
see
what
action
the
committee
might
take
arise
from
that
discussion
.
if
member
be
of
a
mind
not
to
intervene
further
,
I
propose
that
the
joint
committee
keep
the
petition
open
.
we

general
of

she
to

first
available
opportunity

issue

at

to

to
consider
this
matter
further
,
I
be
pleased
to
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
with
special
responsibility
for
mental
health
and
old
people
at
the
Department
of
Health
,
deputy
Jim
Daly

I
advise
any
witness
present
to
turn
off
they
mobile
phone
as
they
interfere
with
the
sound
system
and
will
interfere
with
the
broadcasting
of
the
meeting
.
I
draw
the
attention
of
witness
to
the
fact
that
by
virtue
of
section
17
(
2
)
(
l
)
of
the
Defamation
Act
2009
,
witness
be
protect
by
absolute
privilege
in
respect
of
they
evidence
to
the
committee
.
however
,
if
they
be
direct
by
the
committee
to
cease
give
evidence
on
a
particular
matter
and
they
continue
to
so
do
,
they
be
entitle
thereafter
only
to
a
qualified
privilege
in
respect
of
they
evidence
.
they
be
direct
that
only
evidence
connect
with
the
subject
matter
of
this
proceedings
be
to
be
give
and
they
be
ask
to
respect
the
parliamentary
practice
to
the
effect
that
,
where
possible
,
they
should
not
criticise
or
make
charge
against
any
person
,
person
or
entity
by
name
or
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
he
,
she
or

identifiable
.
the
open
statement
and
any
other
document
submit
to
the
committee
may
be
publish
on
the
committee
website
after
this
meeting
.
member
be
remind
of
the
long
-
stand
parliamentary
practice
to
the
effect
that
they
should
not
comment
on
,
criticise
or
make
charge
against
a
person
outside
the
House
or
a
official
either
by
name
or
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
he
or
she
identifiable
.
it
be
perhaps
ironic
that
I
be
read
this
to
somebody
who
be
also
a
member
of
the
House
but
we
must
abide
by
the
rule
.
I
welcome
the
Minister
of
State
.
perhaps
he
could
give
we
a
five
-
minute
overview
of
he
submission
follow
by
a
quick
question
-
and
-
answer
session
and
we
can
take
it
from
there
.
I
thank
the
minister
.
please
do
.
would
the
minister
of
State
like
to
respond
?
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
.
I
have
a
few
question
for
he
.
he
have
speak
about
future
planning
.
as
the
population
age
,
housing
solution
will
need
to
have
great
complexity
.
I
be
sure
he
will
agree
that
the
modus
operandi
will
need
to
involve
facilitate
independent
living
as
near
as
possible
to
the
end
of
life
.
I
wonder
whether
the
space
exist
in
the
current
housing
crisis
to
think
through
the
challenge
we
be
face
with
regard
to
the
zoning
of
land
,
the
housing
policy
of
local
authority
and
the
mapping
of
government
policy
.
I
would
like
to
get
he
perspective
on
that
.
my
second
question
relate
to
resident
of
nursing
home
whose
house
be
vacant
.
there
have
be
some
public
discussion
on
the
possibility
of
facilitate
occupancy
of
that
house
while
people
be
in
nursing
home
.
how
stand
that
possibility
?
it
could
do
a
lot
to
help
to
solve
the
current
housing
supply
crisis
.
the
third
issue
I
would
like
to
raise
relate
to
public
nursing
home
.
there
be
some
vacant
bed
in
Fermoy
Community
Hospital
.
if
hospital
management
personnel
be
seek
to
hold
bed
for
a
great
level
of
acuity
,
I
can
understand
that
.
the
effect
,
in
real
term
,
of
HIQA
bed
management
rule
relate
to
the
operational
space
for
each
bed
have
be
to
restrict
the
number
of
bed
in
ward
that
have
a
great
number
of
bed
up
to
now
.
have
consideration
be
give
to
the
capacity
of
nursing
home
-
particularly
in
the
public
sphere
,
where
there
be
a
shortage
of
bed
at
present
-
to
provide
a
great
number
of
bed
where
there
be
serious
demand
?
that
be
significant
.
how
close
be
the
Department
to
make
a
decision
?
okay
.
my
point
relate
specifically
to
the
HIQA
bed
management
recommendation
.
as
a
result
of
new
restriction
that
have
be
put
in
place
,
a
previous
16
-
bed
ward
in
a
community
nursing
home
be
now
a
12
-
bed
ward
.
I
use
that
figure
for
the
sake
of
argument
.
I
note
that
Senator
will
have
to
leave
because
there
be
a
vote
in
the
Seanad
.
I
thank
Senator
Buttimer
and
Wilson
.
I
be
not
sure
whether
the
HIQA
recommendation
I
have
mention
be
govern
by
statutory
instrument
.
I
wonder
whether
there
be
flexibility
.
if
demand
increase
,
can
we
allow
for
great
flexibility
within
the
current
arrangement
without
go
into
large
-
scale
capital
expenditure
for
new
bed
and
ward
?
can
we
make
use
of
current
facility
and
still
allow
for
the
dignity
of
the
person
and
all
of
that
to
be
preserve
?
can
we
facilitate
great
scope
through
bed
management
within
the
exist
hospital
structure
or
community
hospital
structure
?
I
have
one
final
question
regard
additional
charge
.
I
acknowledge
the
Minister
of
State
be
expect
the
report
from
the
interdepartmental
working
group
.
can
he
be
more
specific
on
the
timeframe
for
that
?
it
come
with
a
health
warning
.
I
thank
the
Minister
of
State
for
attend
and
for
engage
on
the
nursing
home
casebook
.
we
be
to
meet
with
the
various
ombudsman
office
shortly
.
we
might
allow
for
a
further
engagement
as
need
be
if
the
Minister
of
State
be
willing
further
down
the
line
.
that
relate
to
the
contractual
arrangement

I
seek

viewpoint

argue

somewhat
nebulous
.
we
have
the
recommendation
.
they
be
very
clear
.
there
seem
to
have
be
a
political
welcome
and
the
political
mood
music
-
forgive
the
pun
-
from
the

deputy
Madigan

have
be
quite
positive
,
if
they
statement
on
5

28
April
be
anything
to
go
by
.
there
seem
to
be
a
clear
sense
of
want
to
engage
and
want
to
work
through
to
a
solution
.
if
I
be
interpret
the
witness
correctly
,
we
still
have
something
of
a
gap
in
term
of
how
the
oversight
group
work
and
what
the
timeline
be
.
it
would
be
very
useful
for
we
,
when
I
conclude
proceedings
here
today
,
to
not
close
any
petition
,
pend
further
information
in
respect
of
the
actual
process
,
and
to
seek
more
definitive
timeline
in
that
regard
.
on
the
point
Mr.
√ì
Dubhghaill
make
early
on
the
stream
from
C√∫il
Aodha
,
Baile
Bh√∫irne
and
place
like
that
,
we
have
go
from
"
Mise
√âire
"
right
up
to
Jenny
Greene
.
if
one
be
talk
about
cultural
output
and
the
value
,
it
be
very
difficult
to
put
a
monetary
value
on
something
which
be
so
deeply
imbed
,
cultural
and
ingrained
in
the
Irish
psyche
.
I
believe
there
be
a
clear
thread
between
"
Mise
√âire
"
and
Jenny
Greene
and
people
bop
about
at
electric
Picnic
.
there
be
that
thread
.
the
tie
that
bind
be
the
orchestras
.
we
should
not
lose
sight
of
that
.
it
be
important
that
we
,
as
individual
member
of
this
Oireachtas
,
ensure
that
we
find
some
mechanism
to
support
they
continuation
in
every
way
that
we
can
.
I
believe
I
can
reasonably
speak
for
my
fellow
member
here
when
I
say
that
it
be
for
we
to
give
further
consideration
to
what
the
witness
have
bring
to
we
here
today
.
it
have
be
a
very
valuable
contribution
to
we
understanding
.
I
know
there
be
other
mechanism
through
which
that
can
be
do
in
this
house
but
the
committee
on
Public
Petition
be
the
one
mechanism
we
have
in
which
the
citizen
engage
with
we
.
when
the
citizen
engage
with
we
,
raise
this
important
issue
and
garner
so
many
signature
,
it
be
incumbent
on
we
to
ensure
that
we
take
some
of
the
message
the
witness
have
deliver
today
and
feed
they
back
into
the
political
landscape
.
there
be
tremendous
goodwill
.
the
campaign
around
love
we
orchestras
be
resonate
deeply
with
anybody
who
have
a
appreciation
of
the
cultural
output
of
RT√â
.
I
thank
the
witness
for
they
contribution
here
today
.
they
have
be
very
valuable
.
we
will
give
this
further
consideration
now
.
we
be
definitely
more
educate
by
virtue
of
we
deliberation
with
the
witness
today
.
there
be
further
question
concern
the
process
,
to
which
this
committee
must
give
more
consideration
.
everybody
have
largely
welcome
the
report
.
I
believe
that
the
report
be
very
digestible
and
easily
understand
.
we
just
need
to
further
interrogate
the
working
of
the
oversight
and
working
group
and
perhaps
hold
a
further
discussion
.
I
appreciate
that
.
we
will
give
further
consideration
to
this
matter
at
we
next
meeting
.
if
we
need
to
invite
more
witness
or
stakeholder
in
then
we
be
free
to
do
so
.
this
debate
be
a
important
first
cut
.

want
to
give
this
particular
petition
a
public

of
the
importance

p00044/18
from
Mr.
Darryl
O'Callaghan
.
this
have
be
the
source
of
some
discussion
.
the
petition
concern
the
official
Dublin
Christmas
tree
lighting
ceremony
,
which
be
not
go
ahead
.
the
petitioner
state
that
there
have
be
no
crowd
trouble
in
the
past
and
he
do
not
anticipate
any
in
future
.
I
note
that
when
the
committee
be
in
private
session
committee
member
express
some
view
on
the
matter
.
I
will
open
the
floor
to
Senator
Buttimer
.
I
think
there
be
unanimity
on
this
issue
.
we
should
keep
Mr.
Darryl
O'Callaghan
's
petition
open
.
I
be
get
a
direction
to
the
effect
that
we
should
correspond
with
Dublin
City
Council
.
I
suggest
we
say
to
it
that
we
do
not
accept
the
correspondence
it
have
furnish
to
the
committee
.
it
state
in
it
that
the
traditional
location
for
the
Christmas
light
switch
-
on
ceremony
be
on
O'Connell
Street
.
it
seem
it
do
not
want
to
inconvenience
people
by
ask
the
operator
of
the
Luas
cross-city
line
to
stop
operate
it
in
order
to
accommodate
the
ceremony
.
moreover
,
it
seem
there
have
be
issue
in
manage
the
large
crowd
which
have
attend
the
lighting
ceremony
in
recent
year
.
the
council
have
also
state
it
have
create
winter
light
in
Dublin
city
and
bring
Christmas
light
and
build
projection
to
more
location
and
people
than
ever
before
.
I
think
we
all
accept
that
the
council
be
try
to
do

the
gaming
and
lottery
(
amendment
)
Bill
be
still
with
the
Office

the
Parliamentary
counsel

the
general
scheme
of
the
gambling
control
Bill
give
rise
to
the
intention
to
establish
a
independent
regulatory
authority
.
there
be
arguably
robust
legislation
come
down
the
line

the
question
be
how
should
we
seek
to
influence
the
acceleration
of

legislation
.
it
might
be
advisable
to
seek
to
have
the
minister
before

issue
specifically

I
suggest
the
Minister
of
State
,
deputy
Stanton
,
who
be
take
a
lead
role
on
this
,
might
be
the
most
appropriate
minister
who
might
come
before
we
.
if
that
suggestion
be
agreeable
,
maybe
we
should
propose
that
and
see
where
we
go
from
there
.
there
be
a
suggestion

in

,
"
the
Irish

of
await
a
border
poll

nation

blatantly
dismiss
they
grievance
and
sentiment
"

there
be
very

Friday
agreement
in
respect
of
the
Border
poll
which
we
have
all
sign
up
to
.
we
be
all
Republican

so
we
all
have
a
perspective
on
the
future
of
the
island
and
there
be
a
lot
more
common
ground
on
that
than
people
might
think
.
be
it
agree

member
have
address
some
concern
about
the
issue
at
play
and
I
want
to
give
they
a
chance
to
intervene
at
this
stage
before
we
make
a
final
determination
on
the
petition
.
I
invite
deputy
Cassells
to
contribute
.
we
have
before
we
a
proposal
to
keep
the
petition
live
and
open
.
we
must
have
regard
to
the
response
that
we
receive
from
the
Department
of
Housing
,
Planning
and
local
Government
through
its
assistant
secretary
general
.
once
one
read
the
document
,
one
realise
that
it
do
not
address
the
issue
of
city
status
,
which
be
the
subject
of
the
petition
that
we
be
deal
with
today
.
on
that
basis
,
there
be
a
proposal
here
to
acknowledge
the
fact
that
deputy
Cassells
have
address
he
concern
about
the
population
of
6500
that
would
come
from
the
Meath
side
and
the
issue
address
by
deputy
O'Dowd
in
respect
of
the
CSO
projection
about
reach
city
status
within
five
year
or
thereabouts
.
give
the
fact
that
the
Department
's
response
to
this
committee
have
not
necessarily
address
,
or
adequately
address
I
would
contend
,
the
issue
of
city
status
,
there
be
a
proposal
here
to
keep
the
petition
open
,
to
correspond
with
the
Department
again
and
ask
for
further
clarification
in
respect
of
the
petition
for
city
status
,
and
to
be
very
clear
about
that
.
there
be
other
issue
concern
the
growth
,
development
and
planning
issue
.
I
respectfully
suggest
that
they
would
be
deal
with
within
the
relevant
line
department
or
line
committee
that
deal
with
the
environment
and
housing
as
that
be
the
most
appropriate
way
to
do
so
.
I
propose
that
we
ask
member
for
they
support
to
keep
the
petition
open
,
correspond
with
the
Department
again
and
ask
specifically
about
city
status
.
be
that

behind

he
face
at
the
moment

do
member
wish
to
pose
question
?
I
call
deputy
Buckley
.
be
the
deputy
's
question
direct
at
any
of
we
guest
in
particular
?
do
that
proceedings
specifically
relate
to
the
weir
on
the
River
Blackwater
?
briefly
,
do
this
form
part
of
the
statutory
consent
require
?
do
deputy
Buckley
have
any
further
question
?
I
will
go
straight
into
some
question
.
my
first
be
for
the
local
authority
representative
.
I
do
not
think
there
be
any
ambiguity
about
the
fact
that
the
structure
be
own
by
Cork
County
Council
.
that
be
correct
,
be
it
not
?
we
have
a
submission
here
which
be
a
observation
from
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
.
it
be
one
of
the
document
which
be
part
of
the
file
before
we
.
I
will
quote
directly
from
it
.
it
be
also
understand
that
Fermoy
Town
Council
(
now
Cork
County
Council
)
originally
agree
the
repair
work
would
be
undertake
by
OPW
as
part
of
the
Fermoy
Flood
relief
Scheme
,
and
would
be
pay
for
by
the
Council
.
however
,
the
Council
do
not
proceed
with
repair
work
as
part
of
the
Flood
relief
Scheme
,
but
rather
advise
DCCAE
[
that
be
,
the
Department
]
that
the
work
on
the
ancillary
fish
pass
solution
be
include
as
part
of
the
tender
process
for
Phase
ii
of
the
Flood
relief
Works
.
the
Council
then
advise
that
as
tender
price
receive
be
in
excess
of
what
be
originally
envisage
,
they
be
proceed
with
the
Flood
relief
Works
but
would
be
investigate
the
procedure
for
retender
separately
for
the
fish
pass
.
can
either
Mr.
Healy
or
Mr.
Morey
clarify
how
they
interpret
this
statement
from
a
local
authority
perspective
?
I
assume
Mr.
Sydenham
be
,
from
a
OPW
point
of
view
,
corroborate
that
statement
by
Cork
County
Council
in
respect
of
the
observation
make
by
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
.
forgive
I
if
we
be
get
into
surreal
territory
here
but
,
as
a
local
public
representative
and
a
Teachta
D√°la
,
I
find
it
extraordinary
that
we
have
all
the
silo
of
government
in
one
room
.
whether
a
local
authority
,
IFI
,
whichever
Department
or
the
OPW
,
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
:
"
we
do
not
hold
the
fund
to
do
the
job
.
"
the
point
have
be
make
by
previous
speaker
.
there
need
to
be
a
whole
-
of
-
government
approach
to
this
.
we
take
at
face
value
and
in
good
faith
every
statement
make
today
.
regard
overall
government
expenditure
,
I
do
not
buy
the
argument
about
vote
expenditure
or
vote
funding
and
line
Department
.
Creative
mechanism
can
always
be
find
to
find
a
relatively
small
parcel
of
money
to
do
a
job
that
would
meet
all
the
State
's
obligation
,
and
that
be
the
point
.
it
be
the
state
that
have
this
obligation
in
respect
of
EU
legislation
and
directive
.
as
chairman
,
I
perceive
that
we
be
hide
behind
certain
directive
.
we
be
say
that
there
be
a
statutory
obligation
and
that
statutory
consent
be
require
.
this
have
be
very
enlightening
because
it
have
highlight
the
clear
line
of
demarcation
that
seem
to
exist
between
Department
in
respect
of
who
hold
the
can
.
the
time
in
which
we
be
live
be
not
as
constrain
as
2011
.
consider
the
figure
of
‚Ç¨
1.34
million
and
‚Ç¨
1.7
million
in
they
entirety
in
the
context
of
overall
government
expenditure
,
one
would
be
hopeful
that
all
stakeholder
could
come
to
some
agree
,
co-ordinate
and
unified
position
in
tandem
with
the
stakeholder
on
the
ground
so
that
this
could
be
fund
.
I
fail
to
understand
what
the
‚Ç¨
350000
will
buy
.
we
have
hear
from
TJ
O'Connor
and
associate
and
White
Young
Green
.
there
have
be
other
report
on
the
need
in
this
regard
.
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
we
will
call
what
be
on
the
table
a
northern
relief
pass
.
there
be
also
a
repair
and
restoration
project
.
they
represent
two
discrete
budget
line
.
the
council
say
that
it
do
not
have
the
funding
to
carry
out
either
project
.
it
have
extend
its
l√°mh
amach
to
the
minister
for
a
few
bob
,
a
small
amount
of
money
,
for
more
consultation
.
do
it
not
understand
why
the
people
of
Fermoy
be
exasperated
and
weary
at
this
stage
?
my
understanding
be
that
the
local
authority
be
seek
a
loan
facility
from
the
European
investment
Bank
,
EIB
.
will
Mr.
Morey
confirm
that
?
I
refer
to
a
loan
facility
for
general
purpose
.
have
that
loan
facility
be
secure
?
how
much
be
available
under
it
?
Cork
County
Council
have
publicise
the
fact
that
it
be
seek
this
facility
.
the
public
perception
be
certainly
that
it
have
be
secure
,
if
I
may
be
bold
enough
to
say
so
.
everybody
,
include
the
various
stakeholder
here
,
agree
that
Cork
County
Council
own
the
structure
and
have
responsibility
in
respect
of
heritage
,
conservation
,
protect
local
amenity
,
and
the
migration
of
fish
under
the
habitat
directive
and
the
water
framework
directive
.
if
the
Department
of
the
Minister
,
deputy
Murphy
,
be
say
,
as
I
interpret
it
,
that
it
be
a
issue
for
the
OPW
or
inland
Fishery
Ireland
,
the
Department
of
Communication
,
Climate
Action
and
environment
be
say
that
it
be
a
matter
for
the
council
,
and
the
OPW
be
say
that
it
be
not
a
matter
for
its
office
,
it
seem
that
all
road
lead
back
to
the
council
.
in
the
absence
of
any
signal
from
the
witness
represent
the
line
Department
or
of
a
political
cheque
be
write
,
be
it
beyond
the
bound
of
possibility
that
this
could
be
fund
through
a
EIB
loan
facility
?
I
be
not
play
devil
's
advocate
here
.
I
be
try
to
find
a
solution
or
to
find
some
ground
on
which
we
can
start
talk
about
solution
.
would
Cork
County
Council
consider
such
a
proposal
?
to
unpack
what
Mr.
Healy
have
say
,
the
loan
facility
be
not
guarantee
.
it
have
not
be
secure
and
therefore
the
repair
and
restoration
of
the
weir
and
fish
pass
be
not
be
consider
as
a
potential
project
to
fund
through
it
.
be
that
a
fair
assumption
?
the
council
be
not
consider
the
repair
and
restoration
of
the
weir
in
Fermoy
and
a
northern
bypass
as
project
to
be
fund
through
the
loan
facility
that
may
be
offer
by
the
EIB
.
it
fall
outside
it
.
that
be
the
unambiguous
answer
I
be
look
for
.
if
it
can
not
be
fund
through
the
loan
facility
,
we
be
now
back
to
either
the
local
authority
's
own
resource
or
central
government
.
it
be
effectively
one
or
the
other
.
be
that
a
fair
assessment
?
how
much
do
the
council
have
in
the
kitty
at
the
moment
?
it
be
map
out
the
potential
cost
of
work
.
do
it
have
money
in
the
kitty
to
meet
its
statutory
obligation
?
do
it
have
anything
put
aside
?
be
Mr.
Healy
refer
to
the
seed
funding
of
‚Ç¨
175000
?
that
be
all
the
council
have
towards
the
cost
of
this
project
.
before
I
bring
Mr.
Morey
back
in
,
do
Mr.
Sydenham
want
to
say
anything
?
he
be
signal
.
do
it
include
any
parameter
?
I
think
I
understand
what
Mr.
Morey
be
say
.
we
live
in
a
world
of
couch
language
here
.
will
Mr.
Morey
distil
he
point
so
that
I
can
internalise
and
understand
it
?
be
he
say
that
the
parameter
or
loan
criterion
be
be
set
out
in
general
term
?
we
be
back
to
central
government
again
.
there
be
a
political
prerogative
which
have
to
be
bring
to
bear
here
.
that
seem
to
be
the
bottom
line
.
rather
than
conclude
matter
here
,
with
the
agreement
of
the
committee
,
I
suggest
that
we
have
to
digest
what
have
be
say
.
some
of
we
be
familiar
with
this
issue
and
have
a
overview
of
it
because
we
have
have
meeting
at
individual
level
with
the
witness
over
the
year
.
I
believe
that
this
may
be
the
first
time
that
all
of
the
stakeholder
have
come
into
one
room
and
give
they
position
.
we
now
know
what
that
position
be
,
as
frustrating
as
it
may
be
to
hear
he
,
although
I
say
that
respectfully
.
we
be
talk
about
individual
silo
and
not
a
cross-governmental
approach
to
this
.
I
accept
the
witness
's
bona
fide
.
they
all
have
vast
experience
and
we
have
have
personal
experience
of
that
in
the
past
,
with
quite
robust
interaction
in
some
instance
.
with
the
permission
of
the
one
member
who
remain
,
deputy
Buckley
,
I
propose
to
express
we
gratitude
and
then
take
the
witness
's
submission
under
advisement
and
consider
they
further
.
perhaps
the
committee
will
then
draw
up
a
set
of
conclusion
base
on
the
submission
receive
.
the
petition
would
remain
open
.
do
Ms
O'Brien
wish
to
speak
again
?
Ms
O'Brien
have
just
open
another
silo
but
we
will
engage
with
the
Department
.
the
witness
will
all
be
back
in
three
week
and
official
of
the
Department
of
Transport
,
Tourism
and
Sport
will
be

the

rowing
have
become

‚Äî

I
thank
sincerely
the
people
of
Cork
East
for
the
privilege
they
have
afford
I
by
elect
I
to
the
House
.
I
look
forward
to
work
for
they
and
on
they
behalf
.
to
be
blunt
,
the
minister
's
reply
have
be
hear
many
time
before
.
he
do
not
answer
the
question
as
I
pose
it
and
as
it
pertain
to
the
Greencore
site
specifically
.
although
he
meet
the
Taoiseach
and
other
in
March
2006
,
much
progress
have
be
make
since
,
in
so
far
as
a
special
local
area
plan
have
be
adopt
for
Mallow
.
I
be
glad
to
participate
in
draw
up
the
plan
,
in
which
we
designate
30
acre
within
the
site
to
be
use
as
a
high
environmental
,
quality
enterprise
and
employment
zone
.
the
question
on
everyone
's
lip
in
Mallow
and
north
Cork
be
whether
a
enterprise
will
be
locate
on
the
site
.
the
north
Cork
and
wide
east
Cork
region
have
be
deal
a
savage
blow
in
term
of
job
loss
and
the
people
of
Mallow
have
high
expectation
for
the
site
.
the
minister
should
state
whether
there
be
a
specific
proposal
because
before
the
general
election
a
government
backbencher
make
a
announcement
to
the
effect
that
a
American
company
would
make
a
announcement
on
job
creation
.
be
the
minister
aware
of
this
so
-
call
announcement
?
if
such
negotiation
take
place
,
do
they
bear
fruit
?
as
for
the
government
's
support
for
the
worker
when
the
redundancy
argument
be
ongoing
,
it
wash
its
hand
of
the
issue
.
be
it
not
for
the
intervention
of
Mallow
Town
Council
and
the
member
of
Cork
County
Council
,
I
believe
strongly
they
would
not
have
receive
they
redundancy
payment
.
